Flights to Milan are scheduled to resume April 25. American continues to review the airline’s flight schedule to ensure that customers’ needs are accommodated and will make additional refinements as necessary. ### Frequently Asked Questions </p>\n<p><strong>Which airports in Milan does American serve?</strong> </p>\n<p>American serves Malpensa Airport (MXP) from JFK and MIA. There is one flight to and from each city per day. </p>\n<p><strong>When will the flight schedule change? When do you plan to inform customers who were booked on these flights?</strong> </p>\n<p>On March 1, American will run a formal schedule change, and customers who are booked on impacted flights will see their reservation updated on <a href=\"http://www.aa.com\">aa.com</a>. Our teams will contact affected customers directly to accommodate their needs. Customers who booked through a travel agent will be contacted by their agency directly beginning March 1.

If a flight is canceled and a customer chooses to not be rebooked, they may request a full refund by visiting <a href=\"https://www.aa.com/refunds\">aa.com/refunds</a>. ## Amendment to presidential proclamation As a result of the amendment to the Jan. 31, 2020, presidential proclamation, the United States government has imposed the following additional entry requirements that take effect March 2, after 5 p.m. ET: * Any U.S. citizen or lawful U.S. permanent resident returning to the United States who has traveled to Iran within the previous 14 days must enter the United States through an approved airport. American Airlines customers will be rebooked, if necessary, to one of those airports by our Reservations and Airport teams. * Foreign nationals who have traveled to Iran within the last 14 days will be denied permission to travel to the United States. These entry requirements are in addition to those imposed by the presidential proclamation on Jan. 31, which restricted entry to the U.S. from mainland China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). American continues to work closely with U.S. authorities to comply with these new orders while treating all of our customers with respect. American is committed to taking care of any affected customers by assisting them with rebooking options and full refunds. Our team is proactively reaching out to customers who may be affected by this travel restriction to ensure they are accommodated. ### Frequently Asked Questions </p>\n<p><strong>When do these orders go into effect?</strong> </p>\n<p>These orders apply to all flights departing for the United States after 5 p.m. ET on March 2.
