Update - 31 March 2020</p>\n<p>In light of the current situation, I thought it would be helpful to update you on the work underway in recent weeks to support our prospective students being co-ordinated through the COVID-19 Student Recruitment Group.</p>\n<p>Our Admissions Team continues to receive and process applications across all levels of study for September 2020 and beyond. Despite the global pandemic, we continue to see increases in application numbers of around 40% on last year’s figures, and our Enquiries Team responds to over 1,000 enquiries every week. When these students will be able to join us on campus in Aberdeen remains uncertain.</p>\n<p>As you will be aware, the UK and Scottish Governments announced the cancellation of school exams this summer. However, we are advised that candidates will be awarded a grade for each subject. UCAS has also extended deadlines to provide offer holders with an extra two weeks to respond to offers for September 2020. We understand the impact of these changes and the concern that they cause to our applicants.</p>\n<p>Further afield, there are restrictions on travel in countries all around the world. As a result, many international students are facing delays in applications for visas. There are also challenges around English language testing and the cancellation of exams at schools and universities.</p>\n<p>We remain aware of changing situation and the need to provide our prospective students with flexible options. This includes increasing the number of PGT programmes with January starts and making use of online options.</p>\n<p>Recognising the challenge that many applicants will have in meeting English language requirements due to the closure of International English Language Testing System centres in many countries, we have reviewed the ten-week and five-week pre-sessional programme delivered by the Language Centre, and will now be delivering these online.</p>\n<p>Events planned for the admissions and recruitment cycle for autumn 2020 and autumn 2021 have been cancelled. However, we have responded to this by holding more digital events. Building on the success of our recent Virtual Offer Holder day, we are engaging with prospective students online. We have expanded our one-to-one booking service for advice to prospective students, and we are extending our use of Unibuddy, a new peer-to-peer engagement tool.</p>\n<p>We are also engaging with applicants through online recruitment fairs. Through these channels, we are able to assure our prospective students of our understanding of the difficult situation they are facing, and of our willingness to help them to realise their academic ambitions. The response to these measures has been extremely positive.</p>\n<p>The Professional Services teams within External Relations and Marketing will be crucial to our continuing success as an institution, and I would like to express my personal thanks for their resilience in adjusting to new ways of working, as we all have, and for supporting our future student ambitions. I am also grateful to staff across the University for their efforts in working with us to promote our academic programmes and supporting our prospective students.</p>\n<p>I will update you further as events develop and our recruitment activities progress.</p>\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n<p>Alan</p>\n<p>Professor Alan Speight</p>\n<p>Vice-Principal Student Recruitment</p>","id":"47bfa817-f553-5521-b018-257fb0b91dce","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-abdn.ac/2020-04-08-23_46_59/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 staff update - Student Recruitment:admissions, enquiries, English language testing & events"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/global/images/icons/apple-touch-icon.png\"></p>\n<p>COVID-19 - Student Update - Levels 3, 4 &#x26; 5 assessment</p>\n<p>Student Update - 26 March 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Student,</p>\n<p>Levels 3, 4 &#x26; 5 assessment</p>\n<p>We appreciate that this is an anxious time for all students.

As stated, we will ensure that assessment is as flexible as possible so that you are given every opportunity to complete the requirements for your courses.</p>\n<p>If for whatever reason you are unable to complete the assessments within the normal timescales, there will be an opportunity to complete the assessment at a later time without penalty.</p>\n<p>We know it is a difficult and uncertain time.

On these days, we strongly encourage you not to use your phones or IT equipment for business purposes and you should prioritise spending your day free from any work activities.</p>\n<p>Of course, we fully appreciate that for some teams experiencing a particularly high level of demand, a collective day off is simply not possible.</p>\n<p>There are those within our community who continue to work tirelessly on campus, with appropriate distancing measures, as essential key workers. To you we give thanks, as without your contribution it would not be possible to keep the University running remotely. Be assured that we are exploring ways in which we can best recognise your efforts and we will be in touch with you on that in due course. In the meantime, we want to make sure you enjoy the same benefits as everyone else, therefore you should arrange with your line manager to take your rest day on another day to suit. The same advice applies to staff members who are part-time and don’t usually work Mondays, or who have arranged sessions with students which are difficult to reschedule.</p>\n<p>To be clear, this will have no impact on your annual leave entitlement, and we encourage you to continue to take annual leave as usual - if your rest day falls on a day when you are on annual leave, please rearrange your rest day. Now more than ever, it is vitally important that you take time for yourself away from work, to spend time with your families and for the benefit of your own wellbeing. Updated guidance on arranging annual leave is available on our coronavirus FAQs (item 8 under the ‘staff related’ section).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the University has responded to calls from our student body to provide refunds on student accommodation for those who have chosen to leave University residences. You can find out more here. We have also confirmed with the Department of Education that returning home from University accommodation is allowed as essential travel for students under the new Government guidelines.</p>\n<p>We will also today inform our student community that, following detailed consultation, we will not require Level 1 and Level 2 students to undertake examinations in the forthcoming exam diet, with a small number of exceptions. This message will be sent to students shortly, and a separate message to staff is available to view here.</p>\n<p>Many of us have now started to establish a routine of working from home, and it is important that we try to observe the same principles as we would in the office to look after ourselves. While working from home be sure to take regular breaks from the screen, get up from your desk and move around, and maintain virtual social contact with your colleagues. Further guidance on this is available here.</p>\n<p>On a final note, Monday’s message from the Prime Minister was a sobering one, as again we face new restrictions that are fundamentally changing the way we interact in our day-to-day lives. Please take time to follow the advice on our coronavirus webpages on what you can do to promote your own wellbeing, for example through the daily 15-minute mindfulness sessions led by Colette Savage, Lecturer in Mindfulness in the School of Education, which run from 9.30 - 9.45am on Microsoft Teams.</p>\n<p>Through these updates we will continue to provide you with the latest information and advice that can help you navigate these challenging times, and update you on the adjustments that the University is making to respond to the current difficulties faced by the higher education sector.</p>\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n<p>George and Karl</p>","id":"7c2837a1-1eb8-5329-8b70-16aa87902daf","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-abdn.ac/2020-04-08-23_47_07/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 - rest days, annual leave, student accommodation refunds and student assessment"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/global/images/icons/apple-touch-icon.png\"></p>\n<p>COVID-19 - Update for students with University accommodation contracts</p>\n<p>Student Update - accommodation contracts - 24 March</p>\n<p>Dear Student</p>\n<p>We are aware many of you have had concerns surrounding your University accommodation lease given the current climate.</p>\n<p>We are now able to advise that the University has taken the decision to allow students - who wish to take this step - early release from accommodation contracts and students will be refunded.</p>\n<p>Students wishing to end their lease agreement can do so by giving 28 days' notice with effect from Friday 20 March which was identified as an appropriate date in recognition of all other University buildings being closed in line with government advice.</p>\n<p>Your contract will then be cancelled with effect from 17 April and you will no longer be charged rent for the room. If you have already made payment of your accommodation fees, an appropriate refund will be made to you by our Finance Department. Please note that this will take time to action, but you do not need to take further action to receive this refund other than giving notice in the way described below.</p>\n<p>Please let me stress that this does not mean that University accommodation is closing. While some of you may have already moved out, there are many of you who are staying on, and I would like to reassure you that our accommodation remains open.</p>\n<p>For those students who wish to vacate halls and travel home now, the University has received advice from the Department of Education that returning home from accommodation is considered essential travel.</p>\n<p>So that we can make the necessary arrangements for those wishing to end their lease and those choosing to remain in University accommodation, we ask that all students in University accommodation complete this form.</p>\n<p>We understand that you may have further questions and we have tried to answer some of these here. If your question is not answered, please email coronavirus@abdn.ac.uk.</p>\n<p>We know that this is a troubling time, however we would like to ask that you bear with us during this extremely busy period, and please be assured that our teams are working hard to ensure all the required measures are put in place for both those choosing to end their agreements, and those who will be staying in our accommodation over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n<p>Karl</p>\n<p>Professor Karl Leydecker</p>\n<p>Chair of Coronavirus Steering Group</p>\n<p>Senior Vice-Principal</p>","id":"b2278ad7-a3ee-5fee-8deb-a90e36153f3f","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-abdn.ac/2020-04-08-23_47_10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 - Update for students with University accommodation contracts"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/global/images/icons/apple-touch-icon.png\"></p>\n<p>COVID-19 - Student Update - remote study &#x26; working, mental health &#x26; other support advice</p>\n<p>Student Update - 3 April 2020</p>\n<p>Dear students,</p>\n<p>As we come to the end of week two on lockdown, we can reflect on how this change in our working environment is impacting on us.</p>\n<p>It’s great to see so many of you interacting on our various social media channels, taking part in challenges and quizzes, creating content to support each other and keep spirits high.

More information is available here and we would also encourage staff in this position to discuss any issues they have with their line manager.</p>\n<p>Finally, staff will be taking advantage of a rest day on Monday so there will be limited activity being undertaken. We do appreciate that this remains a busy time for a large number of students but would hope that any support you need for your studies can be dealt with on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Remember to visit our coronavirus pages here for our regular updates and FAQs.

The impact of COVID-19 has profoundly changed our lives and I know many people will be juggling competing priorities and real worries about family and friends.</p>\n<p>I also appreciate that you have been concerned about forthcoming assessments and exams.</p>\n<p>Our aim is to give reassurance to our students at a collective and individual level whilst ensuring we are treating all students fairly and maintaining the value of our degrees. This is not an easy balance but we are committed to putting the wellbeing of you, our students, at the centre of our decisions.</p>\n<p>Last week, we set out our <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/guides/coronavirus-covid-19-faqs-for-students-on-learning-and-assessments/\">initial measures</a> to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on your assessments, including ‘no detriment’ for our 2020 student cohort. We received feedback from students, particularly those in their final year, who wanted further clarity about the safety net we want to implement.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, we have been reviewing the new guidance we received on Friday last week from our regulator, the Office for Students, on a range of issues including assessments.</p>\n<p>In light of the guidance from the Office for Students, which provided more clarity for universities, we are now able to give additional assurances to our final-year undergraduate students, namely that, provided you meet the essential criteria:</p>\n<p><strong>No student will receive a class lower than the class which they would have been awarded on the basis of their performance up to and including semester 1 of their final year.</strong></p>\n<p>This complements the initial measures set out and gives an enhanced safety net for final year undergraduates at an individual level.</p>\n<p>The essential criteria are that final-year undergraduate students must have taken the assessments that have been set, and must have obtained the same number of credits as they would normally have been required to obtain for the award of their degree. This assurance also applies to students on undergraduate Masters courses.</p>\n<p>Of course, we know our students are hard-working and ambitious. If final year undergraduate students do sufficiently well in the semester 2 assessment to merit a higher degree classification, they will receive one. Many students perform even better in Semester 2 than Semester 1 and you will want to achieve the best degree you can for further study or your future career. For those students asking whether their hard work and dedication will pay off, I can confirm you will receive recognition if you do better in the forthcoming assessments.</p>\n<p>For those students in earlier years of your degrees, and postgraduate taught students, I know you will have additional questions about how this applies to you. </p>\n<p>For undergraduate students in year 2, the issue is more complex, as students on different courses will have completed different amounts of assessment. We will be applying similar principles to those developed for final year undergraduates, outlined above. However, given the variation that exists between courses, we will be reviewing the details of how this is applied to ensure an equitable approach.</p>\n<p>For postgraduate taught students, we need to take into account the different structure of the courses and the weightings for assessments including the significant dissertation. Again, we will be looking at how we can apply a fair and equitable approach for you.</p>\n<p>Our approach is in line with many other universities in the sector, although it is worth noting that different universities weight their assessment in very different ways over the duration of a degree, so each university needs to consider both sector guidance and local circumstance. Please bear with us as we work hard on these details in order to provide more information as soon as possible. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, I hope this provides reassurance to those final year students who have asked for additional clarity. </p>\n<p>These circumstances are unprecedented in the lifetime of our University, and I hope we can all pull together to navigate the next few months with compassion. We will be in touch again soon with further information.</p>\n<p>With kind regards,</p>\n<p>Professor Peter Lambert,</p>\n<p>Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Learning &#x26; Teaching)</p>","id":"2f44a6a7-b0fb-5d1e-84a5-2922b00a0780","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-bath/2020-04-10-14_43_52/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Important update on COVID-19 and assessments"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>After careful consideration, the University has decided that our summer 2020 graduation ceremonies which were due to take place between 14 and 17 July cannot proceed as planned.

You can find answers to common questions below.</p>\n<h2>1. My contract does not end until the summer but I have left and will not be returning. Do I still need to pay rent?</h2>\n<p>This will depend on the type of contract you have and what is included. If you are living in a rented property, you will likely be in an Assured Shorthold Tenancy. You can only end these agreements early if a break clause is included. Check your contract and <a href=\"accommodation-private@bath.ac.uk\">contact the Student Accommodation office</a> if you're not sure.</p>\n<p>It is common for a break clause to require you to find a replacement tenant, which is unfortunately unlikely at this time.</p>\n<p>The published government advice states that tenants should continue to pay rent and abide by all other terms of their tenancy agreement to the best of their ability. Tenants who are unable to do so should speak to their landlord at the earliest opportunity.</p>\n<p>You should speak to your landlord about ending your tenancy. You can be released from your contract if you and your landlord can agree terms (make sure you get this in writing). If, however, the landlord does not release you from your contract, they can still ask you or your guarantor to pay rent, whether you have moved out or not.</p>\n<h2>2. I left belongings in my accommodation and I don’t know if I’m going to be able to return to collect them. What should I do?</h2>\n<p>Your contract will likely require you to clean and clear the property by the end date, otherwise you could face charges from your deposit and/or lose belongings. You may, therefore, need to arrange for your belongings to be stored or sent to you. Friends, housemates or even your landlord may be able to help you with this.</p>\n<p>Your landlord should be sympathetic to your situation and may be flexible with cleaning and clearing charges. Communicate with them so that you are clear on what will be needed.</p>\n<p>If your property is empty and you have perishable food in your cupboards, fridge or freezer then it is important that you let your landlord know.</p>\n<h2>3. I can’t afford my rent payments due to COVID-19. What does this mean for me?</h2>\n<p>Contact your landlord as soon as possible. The published government advice states that as part of our national effort to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, it is important that landlords offer support and understanding to tenants whose income level may change.</p>\n<p>An early conversation can help both you and your landlord to agree a plan. This can include reaching a temporary agreement to accept a lower level of rent, or agree a plan to pay off arrears at a later date. If a plan is agreed, then it is important that both you and the landlord stick to this plan. Those in financial difficulties can contact our Student Money Advice team for support.</p>\n<h2>4. My landlord has said that I must move out before the end of my contract. What should I do?</h2>\n<p>For most renters, your landlord cannot force you to move out without a court order.</p>\n<p>The Coronavirus Act 2020 protects you by putting measures in place that say where landlords do need to issue notices seeking possession, the notice period must be for three months. A landlord will not be able to seek possession of the property for an initial 90 day period from 27 March.</p>\n<p>This is in line with Public Health England advice, which has restricted non-essential travel.</p>\n<h2>4.1. I live in a lodging with my landlord, does this apply to me too?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately this protection excludes lodgings, holiday lets, hostel accommodation and accommodation for asylum seekers.</p>\n<p>However, the government are urging the landlords in these situations to follow the same guidance, and work with renters who may be facing hardship as a result of the response to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself in this situation, please contact us for further help and advice on <a href=\"mailto:accommodation-private@bath.ac.uk\">accommodation-private@bath.ac.uk</a> or <a href=\"tel:01225386503\">+44 (0)1225 386503</a>.</p>\n<h2>5.

However, it is our intention that the timing of exams will go ahead broadly as planned.</p>\n<p> <strong>A move to restricted campus operations by the end of term</strong></p>\n<p>In order to minimise the risk to staff and the wider community, we will be moving to a restricted campus operation model by the end of term (17:00 on Friday 27 March). This will initially run until the Easter closed days. During this time the majority of University staff will be required to work remotely and only essential staff will be on campus. In addition, only essential buildings and services will be open and operating from this point and a list of these will be communicated by the end of the week.</p>\n<p> <strong>Implications for research activity</strong></p>\n<p>We are working to a default position that on-campus research activity will cease from 17:00 on Friday 27 March as part of a move to restricted campus operations, although the majority of research activity can continue remotely. In addition, a very limited number of research activities and facilities will still need to be sustained through any period of restricted campus operations.</p>\n<p> <strong>Wellbeing</strong></p>\n<p>Student wellbeing services can be accessed normally up until Friday 27 March. In “restricted campus operations mode” we will not be able to provide face to face services, but will be able to respond to general e-mail and telephone queries and where necessary make referrals to other services. Our webpages will be updated with advice and information for available services. Our website will also provide details of support and crisis services that are available outside the University.</p>\n<p> <strong>Events</strong></p>\n<p>All events scheduled on campus involving external visitors from 23 March to 1 June will be moved to virtual provision, postponed or cancelled.

For many of you, the current circumstances will have brought a great sense of disappointment at a time when you would otherwise have been bringing your learning to fruition.</p>\n<p>We are writing to explain the ways in which we are seeking to help you maintain a focus on your studies in this challenging and unpredictable environment, without adding unduly to your stress or harming your academic outcome.</p>\n<p>We want to reassure you that your final academic outcome will not be disadvantaged by engaging with assessments taking place under these contingency arrangements, ie you will suffer no detriment.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the assessments you undertake in the summer is to:</p>\n<p>Enable you to engage in your studies and online teaching with a focus in mind</p>\n<p>Test your achievement against robust standards without the risk of being penalised by lower grades</p>\n<p>Be better prepared for next year’s study or for your next steps (employment, further study etc) if you are graduating</p>\n<p>Provide an opportunity for you to improve on your existing grades.</p>\n<p>If you are a final year or taught postgraduate student, we are committed to ensuring that you are able to graduate with as little delay as possible, so you can progress to jobs or further study. Where feasible, we advise finalists and PGT students to spend time and energy on your dissertations or project work, as these will develop skills and capacity which will outlast this crisis. If you are a returning student, our arrangements will ensure you are academically well-prepared to continue your course.</p>\n<p>How will I be taught in Summer Term?</p>\n<p>Summer term will commence on Monday 20 April for undergraduate students and some postgraduate students. All teaching will be online. It is important that you keep engaging to complete your studies this year and to ensure that you are prepared for study next year.</p>\n<p>In every course where teaching remains, there will be a programme of work which will combine online materials and assignments to work through in your own time and, in most cases, some regular opportunities for ‘live’ interaction with your teachers and other students. There will be four weeks of teaching on this basis, followed by a revision week, through to the end of May.</p>\n<p>How will I be assessed?</p>\n<p>We are reducing assessment requirements to the minimum possible during the summer term, and limiting the number of timed exams. For finalists, we will assess only what is still required for us to certify that you have met the requirements of your course, and to award highly-regarded degrees on a robust basis. For returning students, we will assess only what is required for you to show that you are academically prepared to enter the next year of study. In some courses with external accreditation, our assessments will give you the opportunity to demonstrate that you have met these professional standards. Precise details may vary between subjects because of individual disciplinary requirements.</p>\n<p>What if I can’t participate in the online teaching?</p>\n<p>If you cannot participate in online teaching, we will ask you to let us know once in any 14-day period.</p>\n<p>Please let your School Office know if you are struggling with connectivity and technical issues. They will be able to direct you to suitable technical support, or put alternative arrangements in place.</p>\n<p>If you are having difficulties related to well-being, please contact your teachers, personal tutors and the Wellbeing Service for support.</p>\n<p>What if I can’t undertake my assessments?</p>\n<p>For any students unable to undertake summer assessments, there will be a further opportunity during a second assessment period. We will publish the dates as soon as we are able. These assessments will also be online.</p>\n<p>For any circumstances which have affected you since 1 March 2020, and until 18 September 2020, you will not need to provide any evidence. Schools and exam boards will automatically allow you an extension or a deferral to a second summer assessment period.</p>\n<p>Should I submit extenuating circumstances now?</p>\n<p>If you find that there are very exceptional circumstances that we should be aware of, which go beyond the arrangements we are putting in place, please seek advice from your personal tutor, Senior Tutor or the Wellbeing Service. You will be able to use the simplified extenuating circumstances process during the summer term. Please wait for this simplified EC process before submitting anything into the system now, but please let your personal tutor or the well-being service know so that we can support you.</p>\n<p>I’m a Postgraduate student, will I be able to do my dissertation or project?</p>\n<p>Taught postgraduate students may progress to the dissertation or project phase of the degree, even if the assessments in the taught element are not yet complete – your programme directors will be in touch with further details.</p>\n<p>I was supposed to have a re-sit from Teaching Block 1, what’s going to happen?</p>\n<p>If you were expecting a re-sit connected to work in Teaching Block 1, please await confirmation from your school – here again, we will look to be flexible.</p>\n<p>Will I get my coursework back within the standard 3-week timeframe?</p>\n<p>Please be aware that it may not always be possible to mark and return your work within our normal period of three weeks: staff are working extremely hard, but in the current situation our capacity may be reduced because of illness.</p>\n<p>Are graduations going ahead?</p>\n<p>We have taken the difficult decision to postpone our graduation ceremonies. We are working hard to schedule alternative gatherings when possible, and we thank everyone for their understanding. We will be in touch across the next few weeks with further information.</p>\n<p>Successful graduates will receive their degree award following the Examination Boards, which will take place for undergraduate finalists during July and during September (for students who need to defer some assessments).</p>\n<p>If you have queries and concerns, please consult our Frequently Asked Questions page in the first instance.</p>\n<p>Remember we have resources available if you need support with your study skills. Wellbeing support in these challenging times is also available.</p>\n<p>We hope that this information gives you greater clarity and certainty in a time of crisis. We understand how difficult these circumstances are for you, and as a staff we empathise with all the disappointment and disruption you must be experiencing. We hope that you will be able to take a break and rest over the coming Easter period, and that you will return ready to engage in the online community which your lecturers have been preparing. Please be assured that we are doing our best to support you, academically and personally, as we walk through this challenging time together.</p>\n<p>Take care and keep well,</p>\n<p>Professor Tansy Jessop</p>\n<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor Education</p>\n<p>Paula Coonerty</p>\n<p>Executive Director for Education and Student Experience and Academic Registrar</p>","id":"a5f951ca-4da1-508b-ba7a-b2dcdc29dc26","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-bristol/2020-04-08-23_42_44/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Letter about summer alternative assessment"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Dear students,</p>\n<p>Principles and policies for modified assessment</p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has brought uncertainty to us all, as students and employees, as members of families and communities and as global citizens. I am well aware that students are particularly concerned about the prospect of sitting examinations and completing other assessments next term. It is important that the University provides clarity on this as soon as possible, which is what I seek to do now. I set out below the University’s principles and policies as to how we will conduct assessments next term. This information is also available online at cam.ac.uk/coronavirus/students. Your Faculty or Department will be contacting you over the next few days to provide you with the details of your method of assessment for your course.</p>\n<p>These principles and policies have been developed in consultation with colleagues across the University, and have been discussed and agreed with student representatives. We have sought to take into account the wide-ranging views expressed to us by many students. I wish to record my heartfelt thanks to all those who have contributed. What we have sought to do throughout is to ensure that the methods of assessment which we adopt are rigorous, fair and have regard to the health and wellbeing of all our students, as well as our staff.</p>\n<p>As we have all learned recently, situations can change very quickly. It may be that we have to adapt our approach to respond to events as they unfold. If this happens, we will communicate these changes as openly and as promptly as we can.</p>\n<p>This really is the most extraordinary time and there are no precedents on which we can rely. We know that different people will be affected in very different ways over the next few months, not only by the trajectory and impact of the pandemic but by the circumstances in which our students are studying, living and caring. We will always do our best to help and to support you.</p>\n<p>You can find information about supporting your wellbeing at the following webpage: <a href=\"https://www.studentwellbeing.admin.cam.ac.uk/coronavirus\">https://www.studentwellbeing.admin.cam.ac.uk/coronavirus</a>. If you have specific concerns relating to your studies, please contact your Director of Studies, Tutor, Senior Tutor or course director.</p>\n<p>I send you my very best wishes,</p>\n<p>Graham</p>\n<p>Professor Graham Virgo</p>\n<p>Senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Education)</p>\n<p>Assessment Principles and Policies (Easter term 2020)</p>\n<p>There is an expectation that all students will be required to continue studying during Easter term, assuming good health and no significant caring commitments, either in preparation for the alternative summative assessments which replace examinations in Cambridge, or engaging in formative assessment where the Faculty or Department has chosen this as the alternative assessment method.</p>\n<p>To ensure fairness, all students enrolled for the same paper will be required to undergo the same method of assessment. Exceptions will be made if necessary for students requiring alternative modes of assessments on medical or disability grounds.</p>\n<p>First and second year undergraduate students</p>\n<p>First and second year undergraduate students will undertake modified assessments. However, no first- or second-year undergraduate assessment will be classed. Many of the modified assessments which have been approved will be formative, meaning that students must undertake the assessment and will get feedback on it, but they will have no recorded marks on their University transcript. Some Faculties and Departments have required their modified assessment to be summative, which will mean that students will get a mark for their work and this will appear on their transcript, but, because of the extraordinary circumstances in which the assessment is taken, no class will be awarded.</p>\n<p>If first- or second-year undergraduate students are unable to take their modified assessment at the scheduled time in the Easter term, (for example for reasons of illness, caring responsibilities or technical difficulties), the following will happen:</p>\n<p>if the assessment is a formative or summative piece of coursework (e.g. an extended essay), the student can receive an extension to the deadline for submission of their work;</p>\n<p>if the assessment is an online assessment, the student will have an opportunity to take it during a second assessment period, on a date to be determined once the University is fully operational again. The assessments in the second period will be delivered in the same way as those delivered in Easter term.</p>\n<p>Students who are unable to take any assessment either in the first or second assessment period, or only some of the assessment, will need to apply for consideration by the Examination Access and Mitigation Committee (EAMC) for the award of an examination allowance that would allow them to proceed to the next year.</p>\n<p>Finalist undergraduate students and students on integrated Master’s programmes​</p>\n<p>All final year undergraduate students and fourth year students on integrated Master’s programmes will have the opportunity to receive a classed degree. Most third year students on integrated Master’s programmes will have the opportunity to receive a classed degree via the alternative assessments proposed, if it is necessary for their progression to the fourth year of study or if they intend to graduate after their third year.</p>\n<p>The University will provide a ‘safety net’ for final year undergraduates. This will not apply to students on the fourth year of an integrated Master’s programme. The ‘safety net’ means that, as long as a graduating undergraduate student passes their assessments, no graduating undergraduate student will receive a class lower than the class which they were awarded in their second year exams. The 2020 assessments will therefore only confirm the class awarded in their second year or improve it. All students are required to take their 2020 alternative assessments and will be expected to pass (either in the main assessment period or the second assessment period as appropriate). They will be assessed and will get marks for each component of their assessment, which will appear on their transcript. A class will then be determined by the Examiners on the basis of the marks achieved, except where this results in a class lower than the class previously awarded in their second year, in which case that class will be recorded on their transcript. Any student who was not awarded a class in their second year but was allowed to progress, will be classed only on the basis of their achievement in the 2020 assessments. This replicates normal practice.</p>\n<p>Students who are unable to participate in the assessment in Easter term for reasons such as ill health, significant caring commitments, technical difficulties or similar disruption, will be given an opportunity to take the same method of assessment in a second assessment period when the University is back in full operation. Students may not re-sit the assessment in the second assessment period if they were able to sit it in the first period. Students will be permitted to self-certify illness and caring commitments and similar disruptions.</p>\n<p>Students who are eligible to be classed but who are unable to take any assessment either in the first or second assessment period, or only some of the assessment, or students who are otherwise affected by serious medical or other grave cause will be considered by either the Examination Access and Mitigation Committee (EAMC) for an alternative examination allowance, for example a ‘DDH’ (Deemed to Deserve Honours) class, or will be classed on the marks received from a subset of the assessment that has taken place.</p>\n<p>Postgraduate taught students</p>\n<p>Postgraduate Taught Students (e.g. MPhil, MBA, LLM and MST) will be given the opportunity to receive a classed degree via the alternative assessments which have been approved.</p>\n<p>Students who are unable to participate in the assessment in Easter term for reasons such as ill health, significant caring commitments, technical difficulties or similar disruption, will be given an opportunity to take the same method of assessment in a second assessment period when the University is back in full operation.

Later today we will be publishing details of our plans for the University’s assessment methods in Easter term and beyond.</p>\n<p>All students will receive an email from our Senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Education explaining the University’s principles and policies for next term’s assessment. Further details will subsequently be circulated by individual Faculties and Department heads. This information will soon be available online on the student FAQ section of our Coronavirus information page.</p>\n<p>The proposed methods of assessment have been developed in consultation with colleagues across the University. They have been thoroughly discussed and agreed with student representatives. We have sought to take into account the range of views expressed by many students. I am grateful to all those who have contributed to this radical rethink of our processes in such a short period of time.</p>\n<p>Throughout, we have tried to ensure that the methods of assessment we adopt are rigorous and fair, while taking into account the health and wellbeing of our students and staff. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures, and we are truly without precedents on which to rely. And, as we have learned, situations can change very quickly. We may have to further adapt our approach to respond to events as they unfold. If we do, we will communicate this openly and promptly.</p>\n<p>My colleagues and I acknowledge that students and staff in different circumstances will be affected in very different ways over the next few months. Whatever those circumstances are, it will always be our priority to offer as much support as we can.</p>\n<p>Postgraduate research students</p>\n<p>Understandably, concern has been expressed by postgraduate research students – particularly those in the final stages of their work – about the uncertainty of their position. Although some information is available in the student FAQ section of our webpage, I recognise that this does not answer all the questions that have been emerging. The University is in frequent conversations with the various bodies that fund postgraduate research students, and we are trying to find the best way to offer our postgraduates the clarity and the support they will need in the months ahead. We will be communicating about these efforts in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Staff</p>\n<p>We recognise at this time of crisis the anxiety of staff on fixed term contracts (including post-doctoral researchers), staff in temporary employment, and casual workers. This is an especially worrying issue for staff whose contracts are about to expire. We have been looking into the terms under which the University may be able to extend such contracts. Colleagues have been busy drawing up a proposal to help us address this crucial issue, and that will be brought to Council next week.</p>\n<p>In parallel to our own internal efforts to find the best ways forward, we are working in conjunction with other universities to influence the policies of various grant-awarding agencies. I hope that we will achieve much greater clarity over the next week.</p>\n<p>Tackling COVID-19</p>\n<p>I was glad to learn about the collaboration between the Cambridge University Hospital and University of Cambridge technologists who are now deploying 3D printers to design and produce facemasks for our frontline health workers.</p>\n<p>People within the University and beyond have asked how they can contribute to Cambridge’s efforts to tackle the pandemic. One way to do that is through philanthropy. Please visit (or let others know about) this webpage, set up to direct philanthropic resources to Cambridge’s efforts to understand and contain the Coronavirus, and to support a hardship fund for students in need due to the current crisis.</p>\n<p>With best wishes,</p>\n<p>Stephen</p>\n<p>Prof Stephen J Toope</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor</p>","id":"27f64def-f0f5-50e6-9ef0-e39575416a06","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-cam/2020-04-08-23_38_27/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update from the Vice-Chancellor"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/favicon.gif\"></p>\n<p>Final-year students have written an open letter to the University concerning their worries surrounding the university's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This letter has collected over 500 signatures of final-year students.</p>\n<p>University response to final-year students open letter</p>\n<p>23 March 2020</p>\n<p>Dear students,</p>\n<p>Thank you for your letter.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 crisis is an unprecedented event in our history. We understand that it is the source of a great deal of anxiety for many people, for many reasons. We empathise with the uncertainty, unpredictability and shadow it is casting over your lives and across the world and we sympathise with you as final year students. We understand that you are particularly concerned about the impact of the current situation on your well-being and on your studies. We appreciate you putting these anxieties on paper and proposing solutions. These are times for quite inventive thinking.</p>\n<p>We are keen to respond to the main issues you raise and provide the rationale for decisions we are making in good faith for final year students. We are aware that you too are petitioning in good faith. We do need to balance listening to your demands with considering the differing views of final year students. We also need to balance listening to you and being sensitive to all students’ well-being in the crisis with ensuring that your degrees and outcomes will hold worth. Our absolute priority is that you can complete your degrees within the academic year.</p>\n<p>Here is our response to the issues you have raised:</p>\n<p>Missed teaching</p>\n<p>Your lecturers are busy preparing a further four weeks of online teaching after April 20th and we have added a week after the Easter vacation to compensate for time lost before Easter. Your letter mentions that you only have five weeks of taught material for TB2; those students affected by industrial action will have had at least nine weeks of teaching before the summer assessment period, while all the others will have had 12 weeks of teaching.</p>\n<p>Online teaching</p>\n<p>Your lecturers are prioritising preparing online teaching for TB2. We appreciate that some students may find the transition to online education difficult at first, but our advice is to engage with the experience and try to gain as much as possible from it. The Digital Education Office at Bristol is making massive efforts to strengthen the digital capability of our staff so that they can teach you well in the online environment. We are asking lecturers to plan for real time online tutorials and online contact with you during each week. Most of your classes will occur offline (not live, real time sessions)with structured tasks, reading and problems for you to work on in tandem with offline teaching. Where helpful, lecturers will use lecture capture from last year to help you get to grips with content, but we are asking lecturers to do more than this in their online teaching.</p>\n<p>Student well-being and mental health</p>\n<p>Student and staff well-being and mental health are our top priorities in these very challenging circumstances. In that context, we believe strongly that keeping education and assessment on track is an important source of structure, normality and focus. We also believe that we need to be proportionate, realistic and empathetic so our lecturers are setting alternate assessments which are designed to balance the circumstances with the desire to ensure that you get the opportunity to bring together your knowledge and understanding in conditions which do not exacerbate stress and anxiety. All exams will be open book. All will have longer time spans for completion. Your previous outcomes will be calibrated into the overall degree outcome. Most specifically,Education Services are working on a simple COVID-19 system for Extenuating Circumstances. A second assessment period will be arranged later in the year to take account of the high likelihood of many more COVID-19 Extenuating Circumstances.</p>\n<p>Accessibility and EDI issues</p>\n<p>We are very aware that some students will have connectivity issues, won’t have laptops, and that online teaching poses different challenges for equality, diversity and inclusion. We are working to ensure that no student will be disadvantaged by online teaching and assessment.</p>\n<p>Library resources</p>\n<p>Our digital library collection will continue to be available to you.</p>\n<p>Dissertations and supervisions</p>\n<p>Please be assured that dissertation supervision will continue in regular online meetings. Supervisors will be working carefully to understand where experimental laboratory projects and other empirical studies have suffered and will make suitable adjustments to take into consideration the context. We are asking Schools to ensure that submissions timescales are reasonable if dissertation topics have had to change significantly.</p>\n<p>Optional exams/essays and prior outcomes</p>\n<p>We have advised programmes to minimise assessment given the context. The idea of giving students a choice about whether to take an examination/coursework assessment or to accept prior outcomes is problematic. It would allow some students to graduate without evidence of integrating the final term’s work, while others taking the examination/course work have that evidence. Fundamentally the degree award would be different between those who opted out of a final assessment and those who opted in. This would raise questions of the comparability and fairness of awards. We need to ensure that standards have been met for us to award degrees. Finally, please be assured that your final academic outcome will not be disadvantaged by engaging with assessments taking place under these contingency arrangements. It can only beto your advantage to engage with these. We are planning actions to mitigate the impact on students as much as possible and alongside that will run a streamlined Extenuating Circumstances process to capture the impact on individual students.</p>\n<p>We appreciate that none of this is ideal, and you may be disappointed with our response. We hope that you can see the reasoning for the decisions we are taking,and you are able to trust that we are doing this in what we believe to be your best interests.</p>\n<p>With best wishes</p>\n<p>Professor Tansy Jessop</p>\n<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor Education</p>\n<p>Professor Sarah Purdy</p>\n<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor Student Experience</p>\n<p>Professor Hugh Brady</p>\n<p>President and Vice-Chancellor</p>","id":"9e7f0f2d-125f-52d9-91cb-aece6ee84572","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-bristol/2020-04-08-23_42_47/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"University of Bristol"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Dear colleagues,</p>\n<p>Work has continued over the weekend to ensure that our University is well equipped to ride out the long storm of the pandemic, and to be able to move towards resuming its full operations whenever it is once again possible to do so.</p>\n<p>Closing down University buildings is never as simple as just switching off the lights. I am very grateful to our Estates Division, which has not only been providing essential maintenance to the handful of buildings that need to remain open, but has also been assessing the risks posed by the ones that need to be shut down – from water left stagnant in the plumbing, to electric wiring left unattended for potentially long periods of time.</p>\n<p>Students</p>\n<p>We are on track to share with all our students the information about modified methods of assessment for the Easter term. This information will be published tomorrow. A message will be sent from the Senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor to all students outlining the principles and policies relating to the modified methods of assessment. This will be followed by detailed information from Faculties and Departments about the method of assessment being adopted for particular courses. The Students FAQ section of our dedicated website will be updated as well. If any student has any questions about the method of assessment to be adopted they should please refer to the FAQs in the first instance.</p>\n<p>I have to be clear that, in designing alternative methods of assessment in this crisis situation, many members of staff have acted expeditiously, flexibly and with sensitivity to the diversity of conditions. I am proud of the way hundreds of colleagues across the university have stepped up with ideas and offers to work differently. That said, I am under no illusion that the new assessment methods will be universally welcomed. There are inevitably some hard trade-offs in situations as extraordinary as those we face right now.</p>\n<p>We received at the end of last week a letter to students from Michelle Donelan MP, the Minister of State for Universities. We have been asked to share it with all students. The letter can be found here.</p>\n<p>I would once more like to draw the attention of international students who might still be in Cambridge to the latest UK government advice on foreign nationals, as noted in the Minister’s letter. Although the general rule from the UK government is to avoid all travel, there may be cases where students are receiving conflicting advice from their home government. Students who have not already done so, and who are in a position to travel, should of course seek their home governments’ support for repatriation as appropriate. Any students who receive this support should contact their College’s Senior Tutor.</p>\n<p>Careers Service</p>\n<p>Like other University services, the University of Cambridge Careers Service is now operating remotely. It is open to take any queries, and to discuss any concerns you may have during this challenging time. Skype or phone appointments can be booked by email or through the Careers Service Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Visitors to the Careers Service website can also tap into a wealth of resources, including advice on interviews, and practice video interviews. Information on future careers events will follow in the coming weeks, as will any updates on the news emerging from potential recruiters.</p>\n<p>Staff</p>\n<p>University of Cambridge employees will want to know, if they don’t already, about the University’s partnership with My Family Care. Through this partnership, the University offers employees on the University payroll access to emergency childcare, and to a network of adult and eldercare across the country. Of particular interest at this moment are the resources for families, including Coronavirus-related webinars about mental health and wellbeing, working from home and how best to share information about the pandemic with children.</p>\n<p>Tackling COVID-19</p>\n<p>Our University community has continued to rally in support of the nation-wide effort to tackle the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Some of our academics have agreed to film short videos to be used as an educational resource by secondary school students whose preparations for GCSE exams were disrupted (there is a signup form here, for anyone wishing to participate).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, colleagues are working with the Cambridge University Hospital to ensure it is able to cope with a surge in patients. Though Addenbrooke’s is well prepared to manage a sharp rise in patient intake due to a single major event – a large pileup on the motorway, for instance – it is now having to prepare to manage a large increase over an extended period of time. The Institute for Manufacturing is helping the hospital think through the process that will allow it to cope with this increased demand and the implications for hospital capacity.</p>\n<p>Even as official statements suggest that we may remain in this situation for longer than originally announced, I continue to be encouraged by our community’s demonstrations of generosity, inventiveness and creativity.</p>\n<p>With best wishes,</p>\n<p>Stephen</p>\n<p>Prof Stephen J Toope</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor</p>","id":"d8ce9dfe-d081-571a-8976-79f0ddb7714f","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-cam/2020-04-08-23_38_31/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update from the Vice-Chancellor"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Dear colleagues,</p>\n<p>As we come to the end of the first week since we had to limit University operations and move online as much as possible, my thoughts are with those whose families and friends have been directly affected by Coronavirus, or those who remain separated from their families. This is a remarkably hard time for lots of people, and it means that for many it is simply not possible to work in anything like their normal way, or with their characteristic pace.</p>\n<p>We are all adjusting to new patterns of work, socialisation and leisure. A message received from a colleague only this morning struck a chord: \"In ordinary times, walking or cycling into work on a beautiful morning such as this is uplifting – I’m missing that experience\".</p>\n<p>Even in lock-down, people are developing interesting and creative ways to keep the work of the University going.</p>\n<p>Despite having closed its doors for Easter Term, the ADC Theatre is continuing to provide as many opportunities in theatre to as many students as possible. It has launched ADC Online, a season of virtual student-led theatrical content, and has an open call for applications for proposals.</p>\n<p>Teachers at the University of Cambridge Primary School have been sending their students videos every day. The School has set its students some fun challenges – including asking them to contribute lyrics to a school anthem. I am told that the students have risen wonderfully to the challenge.</p>\n<p>With the weekend upon us, you may wish to know that the University’s Sports Service is posting articles with advice for individuals and families about how to keep fit while staying at home – including this recent one, about online running communities.</p>\n<p>Student rent</p>\n<p>The University and Colleges appreciate the difficulties and real anxiety that COVID-19 is causing to students with regard to rent. I want to be clear that students who have left residence because of COVID-19, and as a result are now unable to return to Cambridge, and who therefore through no fault of their own need to break or suspend their rental agreements with the University or the Colleges for the Easter Term (April-June) and beyond, will of course NOT have to pay rent for any of that period during which they have vacated their accommodation. As landlords, the University and Colleges will be providing further details via their FAQs webpages.</p>\n<p>Congregations</p>\n<p>The University announced on 18 March that, as part of the management of the COVID-19 outbreak, no in-person Congregations will take place until further notice. This will affect graduation ceremonies scheduled for the rest of this academic year.</p>\n<p>Congregations have a central place in the life of the University and the Colleges. They matter because they bring our community together, and also because that is where so much of our Collegiate University business is formalised – not least the award of degrees.</p>\n<p>During this period, we are putting in place exceptional measures that will allow the University to continue conferring degrees. Students who meet the requirements of their course would be able to graduate in absentia.</p>\n<p>Some of the correspondence from students who would have graduated this weekend reminds me that, while it is important to allow the conferment of degrees in absence, people have a strong attachment to our ceremonies themselves. We do not want students, their guests or their Colleges to miss out on a quintessentially Cambridge experience. So the University and the Colleges are together considering appropriate ways of celebrating students’ achievement once it is practical and safe to do so. We will be communicating about this in the future, and College Praelectors will be providing advice shortly.</p>\n<p>Tackling COVID-19</p>\n<p>The first COVID-19 patients in Cambridge were this week entered into the national RECOVERY trial, which aims to determine, as rapidly as possible, which treatments are effective for treating COVID-19. Cambridge University Hospital, the Royal Papworth Hospital and other regional Health Trusts are recruiting more patients to assist in the efforts to improve treatment.</p>\n<p>Many people across the University have continued to offer support to our local and national health services in countless ways – including medical students signing up to the NHS Taskforce.</p>\n<p>I would like to express my sincere gratitude to those across our community who continue to use our dedicated email address (covid-response@cam.ac.uk) with offers of support for local and national health services. We are receiving a large number of donations of PPE equipment, and we now have a process in place that enable us to store them and send them to our hospital. At the moment, the hospital is particularly in need of Masks (FFP2 and FFP3), visors, reusable goggles and protective glasses. No more gloves are needed at this stage. If you can help, please continue to use the University’s dedicated webpage as that will ensure that we can provide a coordinated ongoing response.</p>\n<p>A word of thanks</p>\n<p>Unless there are urgent developments over the weekend, you can expect me to be back in touch next week.</p>\n<p>I am grateful to those of you who have responded to these daily messages. I am the first to acknowledge that they may not answer all your questions or address all your worries – they could not possibly do so. I do hope they are informative, and at least able to direct you to the places where some of those answers can be found.</p>\n<p>If these messages achieve one thing, I hope it is to let you all know that you are not alone in this crisis, and that there are many of us working hard on your behalf. In turn, your own feedback is confirmation that we are all members of a large, generous and caring Collegiate University community.</p>\n<p>By way of sign-off, I am pleased to share a short video showing what some of us across the University have been up to over this past week of domestic lockdown.</p>\n<p>Stay safe.</p>\n<p>With best wishes,</p>\n<p>Stephen</p>\n<p>Prof Stephen J Toope</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor</p>","id":"d739f73e-4ed5-55cf-9ef8-659d3682dd24","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-cam/2020-04-08-23_38_36/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update from the Vice-Chancellor"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Dear all,</p>\n<p>As we reach the end of another week in unprecedented circumstances, my thoughts are with those who have been directly affected by Coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Much work has taken place over the past week to ensure that our University can continue its core functions, and that it will be in a position to resume its normal operations when we emerge from the current crisis. My thanks, once again, to all the people across the collegiate University who are assisting in these efforts.</p>\n<p>Online teaching resources</p>\n<p>As we stride into the brave new world of remote education, teachers and tutors may welcome the launch of new resources for online teaching by the Cambridge Centre for Teaching and Learning. The first guide, on \"Moving Supervisions Online\", addresses the planning and conducting of online supervisions – including practical advice about devices, platforms and tools, as well as how to structure online conversations and give feedback. More content will be added to the website in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Student and Staff Wellbeing</p>\n<p>Ensuring our wellbeing – essential at any time – is paramount at a time of prolonged isolation and strain. The University’s student wellbeing pages have now been updated to include links to excellent COVID-related national guidance.</p>\n<p>Members of staff may wish to make use of the excellent resources gathered on our dedicated staff wellbeing page. It includes guidance on working from home (including a useful tool to help us choose the best channel for online communications), as well as general advice on managing our mental and emotional health, and on how to cope with isolation and anxiety.</p>\n<p>Staff Counselling</p>\n<p>The University Staff Counselling Centre is supporting its existing clients via telephone or Zoom. This support will be extended to clients who have referred themselves to the Centre and are still on a waiting list.</p>\n<p>I am proud to note that the Staff Counselling Centre is offering emergency support sessions to frontline staff at Addenbrookes who have a University contract of employment. A dedicated referral system is now live on the Centre’s website.</p>\n<p>At the moment the Centre is not able to take other new referrals, but it has published useful resources and details of alternative services on its website.</p>\n<p>Cambridge University Press and Cambridge Assessment</p>\n<p>Having made more than 700 higher education textbooks available online to students through their University libraries, Cambridge University Press (CUP) is providing free access to a growing collection of research related to the coronavirus, drawn from specialist medical journals, until the end of May.</p>\n<p>In an effort to support the health services at a time of intense pressure, CUP has made some classic medical reference books available for junior doctors. These are a hugely valuable resource when conventional forms of training have been put on hold.</p>\n<p>In partnership with Cambridge Assessment English, CUP is producing large amounts of free, online content for teachers and learners of English. The resources for teachers whose schools have been closed include daily text, audio and video content focussed on different aspects of online teaching. CUP and CA are making this content widely available, and have produced guides on how to use printed materials in a virtual classroom setting. Further information on CUP’s helpful response to the pandemic can be found here.</p>\n<p>Reasons to be hopeful</p>\n<p>We all need reasons to be hopeful. Here’s one. The latest issue of CAM, our alumni magazine, is now available online. It includes an uplifting article examining the idea of hope, and explaining how hope can pull us through challenging times. You can also browse an archive of CAM’s past articles – enough interesting content, I hope, to keep us entertained and informed over many weeks of lock-down.</p>\n<p>More Stories from the Home Front</p>\n<p>It has been interesting and inspiring to learn how some of our colleagues are coping with the new realities of working from home. As one comment piece said about the now ubiquitous video-conferencing: \"Never have so many ceilings been broadcast to so many for so long\". I’m delighted to share another short video featuring Cambridge colleagues getting on with work from their home studios, living rooms and kitchens.</p>\n<p>This weekend would have marked the beginning of the Easter holiday for schools, when many of you would have expected to be away. We are all stranded indoors now, of course, but I hope you still find the time to unwind and switch off work.</p>\n<p>We are reviewing the frequency of these messages in the days ahead. From next week, you can expect to hear from me regularly, but not daily. (I am sure many of you will appreciate having fewer emails in your inbox.) Please know that, even when you are not getting these updates every day, my colleagues and I continue to work hard on your behalf.</p>\n<p>I wish you all a restful weekend.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Stephen</p>\n<p>Professor Stephen J Toope</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor</p>","id":"3b3c0ab9-57f5-5435-98f4-53abe6b23fc6","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-cam/2020-04-10-14_04_15/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update from the Vice-Chancellor"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Dear all,</p>\n<p>I am pleased to note that, even in the current circumstances, the University’s central bodies continue to operate – albeit online. The University Council, our main policy-making body, met yesterday for the first time since the University had to interrupt its normal operations. As would be expected, its discussion focused on measures to mitigate the impact of the Coronavirus crisis on the University.</p>\n<p>Staff – Contract Extension</p>\n<p>We have said before that all staff would continue to be paid throughout the emergency. Particular and understandable concern has been expressed by employees and workers whose contracts are coming to an end within the next few months, and who are therefore faced with uncertainty or financial hardship.</p>\n<p>The University Council yesterday approved a scheme to support individuals whose employment contracts and assignments ended, or are due to end, between 16 March 2020 and 31 July 2020. The Contracts Extension Scheme will support individuals who can continue their existing work by extending their contracts or assignments, on the same terms, until 31 July 2020. For individuals who cannot continue with their existing work, the University will try to find alternative work, on the same terms as their existing arrangements, until 31 July 2020. Where neither is possible, individuals will be offered a payment, which for most people will be equivalent to their usual monthly salary, until the end of July.</p>\n<p>The scheme will be reviewed before the end of June to assess how it is working, and whether it should be extended or altered. Any changes will be put to the Council for approval. Our Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Institutional and International Relations, Professor Eilís Ferran, will be writing to all Heads of Institution later today to provide further detailed guidance on the scheme.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that the Contracts Extension Scheme is separate from the Government Furlough Scheme, designed to support employers who cannot maintain their current workforce because their operations have been severely affected by Coronavirus. Under both schemes the University will need to consider whether staff can be redeployed into alternative roles. Later this week, Professor Ferran will be asking for Institutions’ help in identifying staff who might be eligible for the Furlough Scheme.</p>\n<p>Staff – Guides to Working from Home</p>\n<p>As we all continue to adapt to the new realities (and challenges) of remote working, the University’s HR Division and the ourcambridge team have published two practical and thoroughly useful guides to working from home – one for managers, and one for individuals. Their focus is on building relationships and fostering wellbeing. They aim to share best practice and advice to help make people feel connected and well-supported in these times.</p>\n<p>Counselling</p>\n<p>University and College staff and students resident in Cambridge are eligible to join Qwell – a new online counselling and wellbeing platform launched this month by MIND (Cambridgeshire, Peterborough and South Lincolnshire). Qwell provides confidential chat-based counselling from qualified counsellors, free of charge. Full details are available on the HR Coronavirus website. While this government-funded online service is not intended to be a replacement for face to face counselling, it does provide an alternative for those unable to access face to face counselling services.</p>\n<p>Students – Assessment</p>\n<p>The guidance on methods of assessment has been updated, and students can expect to get further details later today from Professor Graham Virgo, Senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Education.</p>\n<p>I explained last week that the University’s goal in setting out its principles and policies for modified assessment was to ensure fairness and academic rigour while taking account of students’ particular needs and circumstances. Having considered the many responses to last week’s announcement – in particular from students who believed they would be disadvantaged by the modified assessment policies – we have worked with student representatives, and with colleagues from Schools, Faculties and Departments, to ensure a fair approach.</p>\n<p>I acknowledge, once again, that not all arrangements will be to all students’ complete satisfaction. I emphasise, once again, the unprecedented context in which these hugely complex arrangements have been made to minimise the disruption to our students’ education.</p>\n<p>Tackling COVID-19 – Testing (1)</p>\n<p>Last week I shared news of the launch of a new rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19, developed by a University of Cambridge spinout company, and now being used at point-of-care in order to rapidly diagnose patients. Timely and accurate diagnostic testing is key not only to helping us combat the current pandemic, but to enable us to move into the recovery phase in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>Many colleagues have expressed an interest in responding to the call for volunteers to support the Government COVID-19 Testing programme in Milton Keynes. While fully supportive of staff wishing to contribute to these national efforts, and while recognising the need to respond as quickly as possible, we have had to balance this against the duty to ensure that any volunteering arrangements are sound, safe and sustainable.</p>\n<p>One of our duties as an employer is to make sure that the scheme does not adversely affect employees wishing to become involved. The University’s preferred approach will be a secondment arrangement, allowing employees to be released from their normal duties to undertake this important work, while being paid by the University and retaining their usual pay and benefits.</p>\n<p>Guidance for institutions, including a template for the secondment agreement will be circulated soon by our HR Division.</p>\n<p>Tackling COVID-19 – Testing (2)</p>\n<p>I am proud to announce that the University of Cambridge is collaborating with AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline to support the national effort to boost the country’s COVID-19 testing capacity.</p>\n<p>As part of the UK government’s plans to enhance diagnostic capacity, we are working with these two industrial partners to set up a new testing laboratory at the University’s Anne McLaren laboratory, on our biomedical campus. This facility will enable quicker, larger-scale testing for COVID-19. Crucially, it will also contribute to the development of alternative chemical reagents for test kits to help overcome current supply shortages.</p>\n<p>Alongside this new testing facility, AstraZeneca and GSK are working together to help optimise processes at the other national testing centres in Milton Keynes, Alderley Park and Glasgow, providing expertise in automation and robotics to increase diagnostic capacity over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Tackling COVID-19 – Transport</p>\n<p>Even as we contribute to enhancing national testing capacity, the battle against COVID-19 rages on in our hospital wards. To ensure that key workers are able to get to our biomedical campus, NHS workers and University of Cambridge cardholders with an essential worker letter can now travel for free on the Universal bus service. NHS workers will be expected to show a valid NHS ID card. University staff will need to provide a University ID card and their essential worker letter. Details on travel in and around Cambridge, including measures taken by bus companies to ensure the safety of their staff and their passengers, are available on the University’s Travel and Transport page.</p>\n<p>More UL Resources, and Collecting COVID-19</p>\n<p>Our University Library continues to increase the resources it is making available for students, staff and visitors during the COVID-19 outbreak. The UL has now published a catalogue for its growing database of academic resources. The list of available publications is truly astonishing – ranging from historical press archives to scholarly magazines on pop culture, from Early Modern printed books to specialist medical journals – and I would encourage you all to explore it if you have the time.</p>\n<p>As the repository of the University’s memory, the UL is also inviting all of us to reflect on – and help preserve the memory of – these extraordinary days. The “Collecting COVID-19” project aims to capture the experience of the Collegiate University and the city of Cambridge during the pandemic. Members of the collegiate University and the wider community are being invited to submit digital and physical records of our times – including (but not limited to) videos, photographs, posters, leaflets, audio recordings, creative projects, journals and diaries.</p>\n<p>As news reaches us of the effect of the virus at the highest levels of the British government, our thoughts and very best wishes are with everyone afflicted – or affected – by the disease.</p>\n<p>Stephen</p>\n<p>Professor Stephen J Toope​</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor</p>","id":"d51808d1-09a6-513a-9c4d-8fb89c18edc1","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-cam/2020-04-10-14_04_20/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update from the Vice-Chancellor"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Dear students,</p>\n<p>Policies for modified assessment</p>\n<p>My message of last week set out the principles and policies for modified assessments. As I said, a great deal of work was done to consult on these arrangements, and to set out an approach that maintains academic rigour, is fair and takes account of the particular needs and circumstances of all students. It was important to me to bring some clarity to you as soon as possible: I know that for some, the prospect of changes to your assessment has been a source of concern.</p>\n<p>In setting out the University’s approach last week, I also said that we may have to adapt it. I have had a large number of emails from students who have proposed changes to the policies I set out last week. I have read these emails, and have carefully considered the points raised, in discussion with my colleagues in Schools, Faculties and Departments and with student representatives. As a consequence of these discussions, I want to update you on some clarifications to the policy.</p>\n<p>Safety net for graduating undergraduates who were not classed last year</p>\n<p>Where a final-year undergraduate student was not classed last year it will not be possible to apply the safety net automatically with reference to the class they obtained in the year before that. Where, however, the final-year classification of such a student is lower than that which they obtained two years ago it will now be possible for them to apply through their College to the Examination Access and Mitigation Committee (EAMC) for a review of their final year classification. This review will have regard to: the class and marks they obtained two years ago; any marks obtained last year; the marks obtained this year; and any other evidence of the quality of their work during the last academic year and this academic year, including supervision reports and any marks on formative assessment. The EAMC will consider this evidence and may conclude that it suggests that that the student is capable of achieving a higher class than that awarded. In such circumstances the EAMC will recommend to the Board of Examiners that the higher class should be awarded.</p>\n<p>Added 09/04/20: the safety net does apply to students who last received a class in their second year, such as those who participated in the Year Abroad last year and also applies to a student who intermitted after IB (or indeed after Part II who is now reading for Part III.)</p>\n<p>Safety net for Integrated Master’s students</p>\n<p>A number of Integrated Master’s students (students taking a four-year course at Cambridge where the fourth year gives them a Master’s award) expressed concern at the proposal that the safety net would not apply to their fourth year. This principle had been adopted because it was clear that a safety net could not be applied consistently across all Integrated Master’s courses. As a result of detailed discussion with relevant Faculties and Departments, we have agreed to categorise Integrated Master’s courses in three ways as follows.</p>\n<p>CATEGORY A:</p>\n<p>The safety net will apply to Category A courses, where the fourth year of the course is fully integrated into the undergraduate portion of the course and the modified assessment which has been arranged will provide a student with the opportunity to be classed. These courses are: Chemical Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Natural Science Tripos (except Astrophysics and History and Philosophy of Science).</p>\n<p>CATEGORY B:</p>\n<p>The safety net will not apply to Category B courses, where the course is not fully integrated and is effectively a stand-alone Master’s courses. These courses are: Computer Science and History and Philosophy of Science.</p>\n<p>CATEGORY C:</p>\n<p>The safety net will not apply to Category C courses because there will be a pass/fail assessment in the summer and students will be given the opportunity to return to Cambridge when the University is fully operational again to sit exams to obtain a class. These courses are: Maths, Astrophysics and Engineering.</p>\n<p>Transcript</p>\n<p>A number of students raised concerns that marks appearing on their transcript would be subject to different interpretation by prospective employers or academic institutions. We are working on the explanatory text that will be included on the transcript to explain why in some cases a class has not been awarded, how the safety net operates and the extraordinary circumstances in which the assessment was taken.</p>\n<p>Preparing for assessment</p>\n<p>As regards other issues raised following the publication of the principles and policy for assessment last week, my colleagues and I have judged that the University’s approach should stand. A final decision has now been reached, and your focus should now be on preparing for your assessment, to the extent that you are able to do so bearing in mind the extraordinary situation we face which may have affected your own health or those close to you. If a student feels that they have been prevented from demonstrating what they have learned in either the first or second assessment period (as a result of serious illness or other grave cause), despite the safety-net policy, then they will be able to submit an application to the ​Examination Access and Mitigation Committee, in the usual way.</p>\n<p>The timetable for assessments that usually occur at the start of the Easter term, at the end of April and into May is being drafted and should be published by Friday 17 April 2020.</p>\n<p>The timetable for assessments that usually occur in late May and June will be built in consultation with Faculties and Departments over the coming weeks and will be published in early May. The published timetable will be available to view on the examinations timetable pages as well as in your CamSIS self-service. The published timetable will show those summative and formative assessments that are to be taken in the format of an online exam for a period of 24 hours or less. Any other formative assessment, as well as deadlines for coursework and other submitted work, will be published locally within Departments only.</p>\n<p>On the subject of timetables, I have had a number of emails from students on the Veterinary Medicine and Medicine courses regarding the timing of their assessments. The School of Biological Sciences will communicate with their students later this week on this matter.</p>\n<p>Support</p>\n<p>Preparing for University examinations and assessments can be a cause for anxiety at the best of times. We know these are anything but, and the collegiate University is working hard to support you to the best of our ability. You can find information about supporting your wellbeing on the student wellbeing advice page about the coronavirus outbreak. If you have specific concerns relating to your studies, please contact your Director of Studies, Tutor, Senior Tutor or course director.</p>\n<p>As a final note, the Vice-Chancellor's daily message has given some idea of the work of colleagues, researchers and students, who are using their knowledge and expertise to assist the local, national, and international effort. I am reminded that among the student body are our final-year medical students, who are about to accept early graduation and go into the NHS at a time of crisis. Their efforts and skills are valued, not only by the University, but by the country as a whole.</p>\n<p>I send you all my very best wishes,</p>\n<p>Graham</p>\n<p>Professor Graham Virgo</p>\n<p>Senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Education)</p>","id":"cc20c3ca-d17a-5ed0-b3ac-9a5b9aa43ecf","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-cam/2020-04-10-14_04_24/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update from the Senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Education) on policies for modified assessment"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h4>Accessing emergency or hardship money</h4>\n<p>If you are experiencing financial difficulty we have a Hardship Fund called the Financial Assistance Programme. <a href=\"https://intranet.cardiff.ac.uk/students/money/emergency-money\">Details of this and how to apply are on the student intranet</a>.</p>\n<p>There are no emergency loans available, as these need to take place face to face.

We are very proud of the way that staff, students and the wider community have rallied together, but we know that it has not been easy. Covid-19 has affected, and will continue to affect, our community in a great many ways.</p>\n<p>Throughout this evolving situation, our actions are being driven by two key priorities: to protect the health and wellbeing of students, staff and the wider Durham community, and to uphold your educational interests. Staff across the University are working hard to ensure that, in the most difficult of circumstances, you can continue your studies and your academic achievements can be recognised.</p>\n<p>The uncertainty of the situation, and the scale and pace of changes which we are having to make, has meant that we have not always been able to communicate with you as quickly oras clearly as we would wish. Please accept our apology, and know that this does not mean that we have not been listening.</p>\n<p>We know that many of you are understandably worried about your assessments in the summer, and so the Students’ Union and University have been working together to agree concrete steps we will take to address these and support you in the coming term. While we work to resolve issues in detail and in full, we want to give you the following assurances.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your online assessments will be designed to be consistent with exams that are sat normally.\nEach assessment should take the two or three hours it would have taken under normal examination conditions. The 48-hour window ensures that students are not disadvantaged if they live in different time zones, have multiple exams, or religious observance or reasonable adjustment requirements.\n\nRequirements and expectations will be set within the rubrics for each online assessment. For example, you will not need to provide the sort of bibliographies or formal citations appropriate to summative essays or dissertations. The assessments will be marked in light of these expectations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2.Your degree classification will not be compromised if your performance in Covid-19 affected assessments is lower than your performance in non-affected assessments.\n\nYou will not be disadvantaged if your performance in Covid-19 affected assessments is lower than your performance previously (for graduating students), or in the future (for those students who are continuing). We are still working on the full details of this policy, because we want to recognise differences between programmes at Durham, and ensure that your final grade will be fair and accurately reflect your achievements. However, the University will operate with a ‘no detriment’ policy, where assessments undertaken during this pandemic can only raise and will never lower your classification. </p>\n<p>3.Your work will be assessed in a way which takes account of the extraordinary and challenging conditions in which you will be preparing for and taking these assessments. </p>\n<p>This has been a highly exceptional year, and all of your departments have spent the past two weeks making sure your assessments fully reflect the disruption we are all facing. We are similarly amending and adapting our marking practices to ensure that they reflect the current circumstances in a fairway. If a cohort’s marks are significantly out of line with previous years,we will review and, if necessary, amend those marks.</p>\n<p>4.We are committed to helping you to prepare for, undertake and learn from this summer’s assessments, so that you can progress in or graduate from your studies.</p>\n<p>The move to online assessment will provide you with the opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned, and to improve on your assessed performance in your studies to date. </p>\n<p>We will enable and encourage you to complete your assessments as planned wherever possible, so that you are well prepared for the next stage of your studies or, in the case of final-year undergraduates and Masters students, so that you can receive the degrees you have worked so hard to achieve in the summer and autumn as planned. </p>\n<p>We will provide support if you have no access to a computer at home. If you find yourself in this position, please contact us at student.supportfund@durham.ac.uk.</p>\n<p>5.We want you to complete your assessments as scheduled, but you will not be disadvantaged academically if your circumstances change. </p>\n<p>We recognise that some of you will not be able to undertake all of your assessments as scheduled. You may face serious difficulties within the assessment period; you or those close to you could become unwell. </p>\n<p>If your life circumstances prevent you from undertaking one or more of your online assessments, a replacement online assessment will be offered. If you are a finalist this may delay your graduation, but we will be supportive and flexible, and no medical or other evidence will be required.</p>\n<p>The impact of Covid19 has been significant, but also varied, whether that be from the virus directly, or because of the different situations in which we find ourselves studying, working,living and caring. We know that many of your plans for assessment and revision will have been disrupted and that many of you will be finding it hard to concentrate due to the ongoing situation. This is absolutely natural and we are not expecting for students to be able to continue ‘as normal’, as we hope the above shows. It is essential during this period that you prioritise your wellbeing.</p>\n<p>We are conscious that the uncertainty which we face remains. The principles set out in this communication are the ones we will seek to adhere to through to the summer, but we will need to be flexible and innovative to respond to challenges as they arise. We ask that you please bear with us as we may have to adapt our approach to respond to events as they unfold. We will communicate these changes as clearly, quickly and openly as we can.</p>\n<p>We will always do our best to help and to support you; as ever, your College’s student support staff and the Students’ Union advice service are available to support you with any individual difficulties you may face.Once again, thank you for your patience in these incredibly difficult and challenging times.We wish you all the best for these upcoming assessments, and that you and those near and dear to you stay safe and well.</p>","id":"12ea9b22-c911-5633-853c-64cc39399131","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-dur/2020-04-09-14_22_50/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"UG and PGT student email - Assessment Policy Update - 1 April 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>To: All students\nFrom: coronavirus.information@durham.ac.uk\nSubject: Covid-19\nUpdate 01.04.20\nTo be issued: Wednesday 1 April, 9am</p>\n<p>Dear students,</p>\n<p>This email contains important updates on Covid-19. Please take the time to read it carefully.</p>\n<p>Government advice\nThough the UK’s Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said that social distancing measures introduced to prevent the rapid spread of Covid-19 are “making a difference”, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that the situation is “going to get worse before it gets better”. So it remains vitally important that we all observe the restrictions currently in place. As a reminder of these, please see previous Covid-19 updates.</p>\n<p>The public health authorities have made it clear that relaxing the restrictions too soon, or people failing to continue to observe them, could be very damaging and trigger resurgences of the virus.</p>\n<p>Latest decisions and updates from Durham University\nThe Wider Student Experience online\nUpdate on building closures\nSharing your inspiring stories</p>\n<p>Further detail\nThe Wider Student Experience online</p>\n<p>Students and staff across the University are working to offer a Wider Student Experience programme (both enrichment and support) online during the Easter Term. We anticipate this being accessible to all students. Where possible we will be looking to move established enrichment activities online, while also offering new opportunities. Much of our support services are already online but we want to go further.</p>\n<p>Many excellent initiatives are already under way, courtesy of students, staff and alumni, but we would welcome further new ideas and proposals. Please email:student.enrichment@durham.ac.uk, or contact the officers in your College, the Students’Union or Experience Durham.</p>\n<p>Update on building closures\nAs an update, all University buildings with the exception of residential accommodation are now closed. Only limited access is allowed, for key workers for safety or business critical tasks. A procedure for where entry is required to buildings has been circulated to departments and we would ask everyone to observe this strictly.</p>\n<p>Sharing your inspiring stories\nThank you to everyone who has sent us examples of how they or others in the University community are responding to the Covid-19 crisis in ways that are supporting others in our community, local communities, the most vulnerable people or the national and international effort. You can now read about some of them on our website here. </p>\n<p>For example, research by our alumna Dr Rebecca Webster into improving public adherence to quarantine measures has been included in the WHO’s Global Research Road map essential references for Covid-19; and Handcrafted and REfUSE, two local organisations founded by Durham alumni, have in the past week alone delivered over 100 meals to individuals who cannot afford to buy food or cannot leave their home.

These arrangements are currently being finalised and we will provide you with a detailed update on this tomorrow (Wednesday 8 April).</p>\n<p>Collection of student information regarding Covid-19</p>\n<p>Many of you will be aware of the questionnaire that has been active since 23 March enabling you to inform the University regarding your current place of residence, any health conditions that cause you concern at this time, whether you are self-isolating, and similar information including data requested by the UK Government.</p>\n<p>Over 3,000 students, primarily those remaining in Durham, have used this questionnaire to provide us with much-needed data and we are very grateful to them for this.\nA number of you have been in touch to indicate that you wished to revise the information you had provided, which was not possible with the questionnaire as it stood. For this reason, and to improve data governance and accessibility to those (such as student support staff) who need it, we have taken the decision to move the questionnaire to Banner self-service, accessible as usual through Duo. You will find it in the “Student Services” menu, under the heading “Covid-19 questionnaire”.</p>\n<p>We have transferred all data already entered into the previous form, and if you have\nprovided data already, it would be very useful if you could log in to Banner to verify the accuracy of the transfer process. The new questionnaire also enables you to provide additional pieces of information. For these reasons, we would like to ask all students, particularly those still resident in Durham, to check the new form on Banner Self-Service and:</p>\n<p>(a)Ensure that any data that you have entered in the previous web form has been correctly transferred (noting that any data entered using a non-personal account will not have been transferred and will have to be re-entered), correcting it if necessary. </p>\n<p>(b)Ensure that the data entered in the form is an accurate representation of your present situation, taking into account any changes in your circumstances since you previously completed the form.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your help with this.</p>\n<p>Accommodation fees – reminder\nAs per our email of 26 March, just a reminder that students who will not be returning to Durham for the Easter term will not be charged for their College accommodation. Please note that:</p>\n<p>Students who have already left Durham, but have not cleared their rooms, will not be charged for Easter term accommodation.</p>\n<p>Provisions are in place for students who have not been able to return home at this point. No student will be without accommodation. </p>\n<p>Private student accommodation provider Unite has also promised not to charge students for accommodation after Easter if email notification is received before this Friday 10 April. Unite say that arrangements will be made to support students who need to stay on in accommodation.</p>\n<p>Updated FAQs for PGR students</p>\n<p>If you are a Postgraduate Research student, please note that the section for PGR Research in the online FAQs has been updated with information on continuation fees and extending supervised study.</p>\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n<p>Once again we would like to thank all of our students for your understanding, patience and questions during this time.

And we are also planning to hold a day, or days, of celebration of all of the achievements of the new graduates of our University here on campus at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>Students will be required to enroll to graduate as normal so that we can ensure that the University gathers all the relevant information to allow the parchment to be sent out.

Essential support staff who are required to work on these days will be awarded an additional two days of leave to be taken at another time, and they will also receive the same level of enhanced pay as they would for working on the Public Holidays of Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday.</p>\n<p>As the current lock down arrangements continue, it is important for all of us to apply a degree of flexibility in our ways of working and to put in place some boundaries that we can adopt with regards to our working day, particularly as many of us are working remotely. We should all take regular rest breaks away from work. This is vital to supporting and maintaining our ongoing good health and wellbeing.</p>\n<p>The University understands that many of us may have had personal travel/holiday plans in place and others may have future plans that are likely to be affected by the ongoing situation. Given the current circumstances under which we are working and which are likely to continue for some time, we would strongly encourage colleagues to utilise your annual leave entitlement, alongside other elements of our University policy provisions as appropriate, to have a break away from work and spend time relaxing and with other members of your household.</p>\n<p>We would encourage you to liaise with your immediate line managers to discuss and agree annual leave plans as normal. There is a broad expectation that we should have taken somewhere in the region of 60-70% of our annual leave entitlement by 30 September 2020. It is really important to our health and wellbeing and to that of our families that we schedule, and look forward to time away from work.</p>\n<p>For some this will not be practicable, particularly for those colleagues who are engaged in the delivery of essential services.

This has been an extraordinarily disruptive and difficult time for everyone and I know that many of you are worried about your studies and your examinations. We have had to make decisions rapidly in the current turmoil, and I understand the additional stress this uncertainty places on you.</p>\n<p>Supporting you through this is our first priority. We want you to achieve your goals now, and be prepared for the world beyond this pandemic. Your degree will be even more valuable in the future when people with your skills, knowledge, creativity and experience will be very much needed.</p>\n<p>Our decision to go ahead with remote assessment was reached only after considerable thought and much debate. I want to thank you for your patience and for letting us know what is important to you through ICU’s COVID-19 Remote Assessment Survey, through your Departments, and directly via your emails and social media. We have listened carefully and worked closely with the ICU President, Deputy President (Education) and Deputy President (Welfare), the Vice-Provost (Education), the Faculty Vice-Deans (Education) and the Academic Registrar to find a solution.</p>\n<p>We believe remote assessment will allow you to progress in the timescales you are expecting and give those of you due to graduate this year the opportunity to meet requirements for further study or employment. In reaching this conclusion, we discussed several options for formal examinations. These included: moving the examinations to later in the year, replacement with alternative means of assessing progress, using only pass/fail grading and cancelling exams entirely. We felt that these did not give you the opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge in a familiar format of exam and were likely to burden you with higher stakes in subsequent years. You can read a more detailed explanation of our decision here.</p>\n<p>We have heard your specific concerns around cheating, the need for practise runs, the timing of assessments and what happens if you do worse in these assessments than your previous work would predict. We have developed an approach to implementing remote assessment (below) to address these issues. We have also put in place a safety net that will ensure your 2019-20 academic year performance will not disadvantage you. You can find more details here.</p>\n<p>The expertise and experience across College in education technology and remote learning gives us confidence to support remote assessment. The Business School started remote learning ten years ago and has been piloting remote assessment in their master’s programmes for three years now. The Faculty of Medicine successfully ran the first all online examinations for their MBBS students this year, satisfying the General Medical Council. The Department of Computing successfully completed examinations remotely in the first week of the transition period. We are learning from these experiences and sharing best practice across Departments to get this right.</p>\n<p>We will continue to consult with Departments, Faculties and the ICU as we keep this policy under review. And we will communicate with you more, through our webpages, our daily updates, via email, and via social media. Your Departments will contact you directly as they put their plans in place.</p>\n<p>We will get through the present crisis, and we will look forward to seeing you thrive and help us reshape the world that will be there.</p>\n<p>Best wishes to you, your families, partners, friends and loved ones. Stay well, and stay in touch.</p>\n<p>Ian</p>\n<p>Implementing remote assessments</p>\n<p>The move to remote assessment introduces new challenges, as well as the additional stress from unfamiliarity. We have addressed these in the following ways.</p>\n<p>Practise runs. These will be opportunities to try out the submission process they are using and to test that you have access to the internet, the applications and packages needed for the exams, and are familiar with the system and the process before the formal assessment date. This will allow Departments to identify problems arising from the practise runs and do all they can to mitigate them.</p>\n<p>The timed remote assessments will take place simultaneously at the time determined by the Department, but we will be flexible in their starting times, so that students can take these assessments at a reasonable time of the day for their time zone. Where students feel that they are particularly disadvantaged by their time zone, they should submit a case under the Mitigating Circumstances Procedure.</p>\n<p>We will be more flexible in the use of the Mitigating Circumstances Policy. We have extended the mitigation circumstances criteria to accommodate COVID-19 related issues.</p>\n<p>We will implement a safety net policy We have also put in place a safety net that will ensure your 2019-20 academic year performance will not disadvantage you. For MBBS students, we will pay particular attention to the regulatory requirements and constraints set by the GMC. For postgraduate taught students, we will apply the policy as far as possible and we are working with your Departments to find alternative methods of delivery for coursework, both teaching and assessment.</p>\n<p>We have adjusted our support mechanisms to ensure we can support you while you work remotely. You can find more information at <a href=\"http://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/\">http://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/</a>. You are encouraged to continue to make contact with your Senior Tutors or equivalent, if you have concerns.</p>\n<p>We know that an unsupervised examination opens the opportunity for cheating. One of the reasons we opted for time-limited exams is that this minimizes such opportunity. Further, vivas may be used as an additional assessment tool to help assure results, in addition to their use by some Departments as a form of assessment in their own right.</p>\n<p>But most importantly, we trust you to act with integrity. We expect that you will not give or receive help from others in the examinations and adhere to the academic integrity guidance and associated policies. These are the standards we hold as a community, and which you and your fellow students deserve.</p>\n<p>Project-based assessments and research degrees</p>\n<p>Several masters degree courses have a laboratory- or field-based component, including some that are research projects. We are acutely aware of the impact of COVID-19 on these, and we are working with your Departments to find suitable alternatives, in particular for project work undertaken in the Summer Term and over the summer.</p>\n<p>If you are undertaking an experimental thesis project for your PhD, we cannot yet confirm when you will have access to a laboratory. We know that this will impact your progress, and we have made sure that the regulations for your degrees take into account the impact of COVID-19 so that you can meet your programme requirements. We are working with your Departments and with the funding agencies to mitigate the effects of this delay on projects funded by grants.</p>","id":"43d139fc-cb20-51e8-b4b4-3fe95c1845dd","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-imperial/2020-04-10-14_03_49/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Message from the Provost to students - Remote Assessment - 6 April 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Dear Students and Colleagues,</p>\n<p>As we approach the end of term, I want to take this opportunity to once again thank you all for your incredible hard work, patience and understanding as we navigate this new, challenging time. In the weeks ahead, it is important that we all continue to maintain social distancing measures in keeping all our community safe and well.  </p>\n<p>The speed at which our students and staff have had to adapt is unprecedented, including moving our educational provision online and moving to working remotely for most of us.

It has been an extremely difficult decision to reach, but we have concluded that the pre-eminent responsibility we bear for the safety of our community of students, staff and visitors cannot be reconciled to these events taking place in the summer.</p>\n<p>I appreciate that this will be extremely disappointing news for you, your family and friends. I should like to stress, however, that the degrees which you and other students have worked so hard to achieve will not, of course, themselves be in any way affected. You will still have graduated from, and be a graduate of King's if you complete your degree. Certificates will be sent to you directly at the normal time.</p>\n<p>Graduation days are a real highlight in the academic life of the university, and often some of the most special occasions for recognising our amazing students and all that you have achieved. Let me assure you that we fully expect to hold celebratory events again in London in the future, which will be open to all those cohorts of students affected by the present circumstances. King's cannot, of course, predict yet when that will be, but we will keep you informed as soon as the possibilities materialise.</p>\n<p>Although July's ceremonies will not take place, we would nevertheless like to explore alternative ways of celebrating your achievements at that time. Again, we will keep you updated about these plans and thank you for your continued patience and understanding while we figure these out.</p>\n<p>I am very sorry to be sending you this disappointing news. These unprecedented times have interfered unhappily with the last few months of your programme. Working together, communicating with each other and drawing on collective support will enable us to navigate the challenges ahead as one, strong community. </p>\n<p>For any of you requiring access to our support services, an updated list is available on our website.

We hope that you and your loved ones are keeping safe and well.  Please continue to follow the official government advice where you are.</p>\n<p>Today I wanted to update you on the arrangements that we are putting in place to continue to support your education in the coming weeks. I know exams and assessments are very much on your minds. Therefore, my first update is about the provisions we are making for exams and assessments for all students and some changes we are introducing for first year undergraduate assessments. I also wanted to give you an update about July graduation ceremonies and remind you of the support that is available to all of you from the university.</p>\n<p>These are uncertain times and we recognise that your individual circumstances will vary considerably. I would like to assure you that all possible steps will be taken to understand your individual situation and ensure that nobody is disadvantaged. We are here to support you.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Exams and assessment arrangements (please note that this section does not apply to students enrolled on fully online programmes)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I know there are a wide range of very different views and preferences about exams and assessments and recognise that some of you have very strong opinions on this topic. In deciding how to proceed, we have listened and considered carefully the views and concerns that have been expressed. I want to thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.</p>\n<p>Our intention is to proceed with the spring/summer assessment period for all students. First and foremost, we are committed to maintaining the quality of your education and your degree from King’s, and feel it is important to provide opportunities for you to continue your studies and complete your academic year. We wish to make sure that you have an opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned, and that your outcomes remain a fair reflection of your academic performance.</p>\n<p>Our approach is to ensure that arrangements are inclusive, realistic, fair for all and that no student is disadvantaged, either by the current situation or by your individual circumstances. I have set out below an initial summary of the changes that we will be making to support you.</p>\n<p>These are the steps that we will take for all assessments:</p>\n<p>Extended assessment period\nWe will extend the main assessment period from five weeks to nine weeks. The main assessment period will now run from 27 April 2020 (as planned) to 26 June 2020. An extended assessment period allows us to spread your assessments out if we need to; accommodate extensions where they are needed; and of course, cater for your circumstances – and those of staff – in relation to illness, caring responsibilities, and other considerations. </p>\n<p>Some of you may not experience many changes to the period dedicated to your exams, but the additional flexibility is important in allowing your faculties and departments some options in managing this process.</p>\n<p>Assessment Boards will take place in mid-July, slightly later than originally planned. We will also continue with the third assessment period, which again will take place slightly later than normal, running between 24 August and 4 September.</p>\n<p>Assessment formats\nIn many cases, assessments will be conducted in alternative formats to allow you to complete them remotely. These may include replacing unseen, timed exams with open-book exams, or alternative forms of coursework.</p>\n<p>We are working to consolidate assessments and, for many of you, the overall volume of assessments will be reduced.</p>\n<p>We would like to assure you that we are planning to ensure that no-one is disadvantaged by their geographical location, or domestic or personal circumstances.</p>\n<p>You will receive further details shortly from us about the measures we are taking, and what to do if you are concerned or anxious about your assessments. These measures will include a range of options for deferral where you are unable to sit exams or complete your assessments, and simplified procedures for mitigating circumstances. Please be assured that we are here to help you.</p>\n<p>Information on assessment arrangements\nFaculties and departments are currently finalising details for the assessment period. As all faculties work to different schedules and requirements, and there are some variations relating to assessment periods as well, each of you will receive full details of your individual assessment arrangements from your faculties directly. Our intention is to have this information ready for you in the first week of April. We ask for your patience as we prepare these arrangements.   </p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Important information about undergraduate first year assessments</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After careful deliberation, we have decided to make a change to our arrangements for current first year students. Your grades from this year's assessments will not contribute towards your final degree classification. Progression to your second year will be on a pass/fail basis.</p>\n<p>We are very aware of all the hard work that you will already have put in, and the work that you will still put in, where you are able to do so, during the forthcoming assessment period. Your first year remains a fundamentally important part of your degree, allowing you to develop skills essential to the remainder of your programme, and to allow you to progress to your second year. We are committed to recognising your work and allowing you to demonstrate your performance and achievements. Your assessments will still be marked, and you will still receive a grade for your work, which will appear alongside your other marks for this year on your transcripts. We want to assure you that no student will be disadvantaged in their final degree classification by these measures.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we recognise that your performance may not meet expectations over this difficult period. All transcripts for current students will carry a note to indicate that some assessments were conducted under exceptional circumstances associated with the pandemic. Where this has been the case, these measures to remove the first year from your degree classification ensure that no negative impact from your first year is exerted on your final outcome further down the line, and we hope gives you some relief from this anxiety.</p>\n<p>As set out above, we are seeking to consolidate assessments and will be seeking to streamline the requirements for first year assessments wherever possible.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>July Graduation Ceremonies </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yesterday our Chairman, Lord Geidt, wrote to all students due to graduate this summer to let them know that unfortunately our July graduation ceremonies will not be able to go ahead at the time we had planned. Students due to graduate will still complete their programmes of study as planned and will receive their transcript and certificate by post. This news will be disappointing for many, and it was a difficult decision to make, but the safety of our community of students, staff and visitors must come first. These events are incredibly important in the life of the university and in celebrating the spectacular achievements of our students.</p>\n<p>However, please be assured that this is a delay rather than a cancellation, and we are exploring all options to hold graduation celebrations at a future date for graduates, their families and supporters.\nFor further information on July Graduation Ceremonies please see the FAQs on the website or email any additional questions to graduation@kcl.ac.uk.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Supporting your wellbeing </li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are a range of resources available to help support you with your wellbeing and mental health, whilst working at a distance from others, at this time.\nKing’s Counselling and Mental Health support  \nKing’s Sport online classes  \nBig White Wall  \nMind: coronavirus and your wellbeing \nWe are also working on several additional activities to support your wellbeing, and to ensure that you continue to feel connected to the King’s community: we will update you on these in the coming weeks.  </p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Student Services  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please be aware that most of our buildings will now be closed in line with UK Government guidance. However, our staff are committed to ensuring that you have access to all the services you need. The latest information and an updated list of how to access our student services remotely is available on the website.</p>\n<p>These are unprecedented times and many of us are feeling unsettled and anxious. Again, I want to assure you that that we will take account of your individual circumstances to ensure that no one is disadvantaged.</p>\n<p>Whilst sadly we are required to distance ourselves physically from each other for the time being, we are absolutely committed to your education and learning. We will do all we can to ensure that you continue to feel connected to the King’s community, and please be assured that the Senior Leadership team, your faculties, departments and tutors are here to support you. We are working as quickly as possible to confirm arrangements, provide more information and respond to any questions you may have.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your help as we pull together as a community of staff and students to support one another.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>PROFESSOR NICOLA PHILLIPS\nVice-President and Vice-Principal (Education)</p>\n<p>DARREN WALLIS\nExecutive Director, Education and Students</p>","id":"3d5fc052-7e06-55ce-a204-ced607cd0ad6","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-kcl/2020-04-09-14_21_53/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Important information for our undergraduate and postgraduate taught students"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Dear Students,</p>\n<p>We know the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been unsettling and we are particularly conscious of the uncertainty this has brought you around exams and completing assessments. We promised last week to write again with more information about how we will seek to ensure that you are not disadvantaged in your assessments and outcomes by the current situation or your individual circumstances.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of information here and not every section we have included will be relevant to you specifically, but please do take the time to read through this message carefully.</p>\n<p>Support for assessment and enhanced mitigations</p>\n<p>Extension to the assessment period</p>\n<p>To reinforce what we said in our previous message, in order to allow for greater flexibility, the standard assessment period 2 will now run for nine weeks, from 27 April 2020 to 26 June 2020. Most assessment boards will convene between 20-24 July 2020, and the standard assessment period 3 will run from 24 August to 4 September 2020.</p>\n<p>Some faculties may already work to different assessment timetables, and they will communicate with you directly about specific arrangements.</p>\n<p>Alterations to assessments</p>\n<p>Across faculties, assessment formats have been altered to allow you to complete them remotely. This has included, where appropriate, replacing some unseen, timed exams with open-book exams, or alternative forms of coursework.</p>\n<p>Departments have also worked to consolidate and reduce the overall volume of assessments where the learning outcomes for the year or programme can be demonstrated to have been met.</p>\n<p>All assessment plans have been tailored to avoid any disadvantage to you arising from your geographical location and time zone. Arrangements for students with Personalised Assessment Arrangements (PAA) have been preserved.</p>\n<p>Deferral and interruption of studies</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage you, wherever possible, to take assessments in period 2 but understand that there may be a range of good reasons as to why you are not able to do so. You can make a deferral request by submitting a special mitigating circumstances form, no later than 26 April 2020 (the day before the start of the assessment period), or the date advised by your faculty where assessment period timings are different.</p>\n<p>Taking the decision to interrupt your studies for a longer period should only be taken after seeking advice and considering the implications carefully. This is a big decision where you would need to consider the consequences for your progression and graduation, career opportunities, and your visa status. If you are considering doing this, please speak to your programme director, personal tutor and/or other advice services to discuss whether ways can be found to enable you to take your assessments in periods 2 or 3.</p>\n<p>Please take time the time to read the detailed information on the website carefully before making any decisions to defer or interrupt.</p>\n<p>Mitigating circumstances process for COVID-19</p>\n<p>We will introduce a streamlined process for considering mitigating circumstances relating to COVID-19. You will be required to provide details of the reason for the request, but you are not required to supply evidence. You should use this process where you have experienced unexpected difficulty in undertaking or completing your assessments due to COVID-19-related issues. Please see the website for more details.</p>\n<p>Technology issues and study environments</p>\n<p>Our priority is to understand your individual circumstances and find ways to help wherever possible. We may not be able to resolve everything to create appropriate study conditions for you to focus on your assessments, or in accessing the technology and other facilities, but we will do our best to support you wherever we can.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to take the time to check that you can access King’s online systems before the date of your assessments. A ‘test’ assessment is being developed for this purpose and will be available soon. Please see the website for guidance on the support and options available.</p>\n<p>‘Safety net’ policy</p>\n<p>In addition to the above measures to support you in taking your assessments, we will put in place a ‘safety net’ policy to seek to ensure that your overall outcomes are not negatively affected by the impact of our current circumstances.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that the application of these principles may need to be adjusted if your programme is regulated by a Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Body (PSRB) or if you are studying on the King’s International Foundation Programme. Your faculties will provide further information for you where this is the case.</p>\n<p>Current first years, Undergraduate\nFor current first years, we have already announced that the grades from this year's assessments will not contribute towards the final degree classification, and only marks obtained from year two onwards will be used in the degree algorithm.</p>\n<p>We also indicated that we would ensure that no student’s final outcome would be disadvantaged by this decision. To achieve this, we will put in place a check at the point of considering your final degree outcome, at the end of your programme. Where your weighted cumulative score (C-score) places you within one percentage point of the ‘two percent’ borderline zone between classifications, we will look to see whether your first-year marks would have made a positive difference to your overall outcome.</p>\n<p>Where the inclusion of your first-year marks means that your C-score moves up into the borderline zone, the existing ‘two percent’ rule for managing borderline cases will then be followed in order to determine whether the higher classification should be awarded. Where the inclusion of first year marks moves your C-score over the boundary for the higher classification, this is the outcome that will be awarded.</p>\n<p>All other years, Undergraduate\nOur aim is to make sure that a student’s overall performance for the year is not negatively affected by circumstances associated with the COVID-19 period. In determining your performance for the year, we will calculate an average based on all completed modules and summative grades available for work completed with submission deadlines up to 15 March 2020, where these can be considered sufficient to give a reasonable indication of your prior performance. Where sufficient information is not available from this year, we will seek to use other appropriate information, which may include the previous year’s grades or marks for formative work this year.</p>\n<p>This ‘safety net’ average will then be compared with your average for the full year, to ensure that we are picking up any instances in which your outcome for the year may have been negatively affected by poorer-than-average performance in the COVID-19 period. For those modules completed after 15 March 2020, marks may be adjusted to ensure that the average for the year is at least at the level of the ‘safety net’ average. Marks for any failed modules will not be so adjusted and resit marks will continue to be capped.</p>\n<p>Students must take all assessments set for them in order for the ‘safety net’ provisions specified above to be applied.</p>\n<p>Current Finalists, Undergraduate\nAt the point of calculating the final degree classification for our current finalists, we will put in place a further check – in addition to the above measures – to make sure that your outcome has not been negatively affected by COVID-19-related circumstances.</p>\n<p>If your c-score falls in a borderline zone between classifications, we will follow our existing policy of looking to see whether you have at least 60 credits at level 6 or above in the higher range, and if so award you the higher classification. However, an additional ‘safety net’ provision will be put in place where we will also look at whether we can find those 60 credits at level 5 or above, and, again, award you the higher classification if this is the case.</p>\n<p>Postgraduate Taught\nWhere possible, we will apply the same ‘safety net’ averaging rules as described above (under All other years, undergraduate) for taught elements only. There will be no change to the assessment of dissertations, given the longer time period that is available for their completion.</p>\n<p>As above, students must take all assessments set for them for the safety net provisions to be applied.</p>\n<p>All students\nFor all current students, we will carry out additional checks at the point at which your final degree classification is being determined at the end of your programme, to make sure that we are satisfied that there has been no disadvantage to your final outcome from this period.</p>\n<p>More technical work will be done over the coming weeks to specify how this policy will be implemented across the faculties, given important differences in assessment systems, and to guide implementation by Assessment Boards in the summer/autumn. Your faculties will make sure that you are kept updated as further information becomes available. For today, however, the important point to convey to you is our commitment to put in place this range of ‘safety nets’ which ensure that no disadvantage is caused to your outcomes.</p>\n<p>Postgraduate Taught to Postgraduate Research</p>\n<p>Finally, we know that some PGT students may be feeling worried about whether changes to their plans for their dissertations and project work will put at risk your applications for PhD work. I want to reassure you that all COVID-19-related circumstances will be taken into account in the PhD admissions process, and you will not be disadvantaged by not being able to complete your lab work or similar as you intended.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank you all again for your patience whilst we have worked through the complexities to ensure the best outcome for all our students at King’s.</p>\n<p>Over the last few weeks we have all had to adapt to a very different environment from the one that we are used to and hoped for. I would like to thank you for your input and feedback, which has helped us shape the approach and measures we are putting in place to support you.</p>\n<p>Please read the information on the website carefully.

Social distancing and self-isolation might make that feel really difficult, but there are things you can do to stay in touch with others: videochat, phone, text, email, and message – use whatever works for you, your friends and your family. </p>\n<p>Be mindful of how much information you’re taking in from social media – limit yourself to reading information from official sources, and you might find it beneficial to only check for new updates at certain times of the day.  </p>\n<p>Remember, Big White Wall, Elefriends and Nightline are all resources available to you which can be accessed from home.</p>\n<p>LUU Execs have also set up a Covid-19 Facebook support group you can join.</p>\n<p>Being good neighbours</p>\n<p>We know the majority of you are good neighbours and do all you can to help others who live nearby. With the UK government telling people to stay at home, please be particularly mindful of your neighbours – many of them will be experiencing the same mixed feelings as you, and some of them may also be vulnerable. Please consider this when carrying out activities at home, as noise nuisance has a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of those affected. </p>\n<p>Stay active, stay positive</p>\n<p>Your day can easily be taken over by Netflix, other streaming services or social media. Be mindful of this, and try to keep a routine. Keep similar wake and sleep patterns and plan your days with time for work and pleasure; this will help you to stay positive, calm and productive. </p>\n<p>Exposure to sunlight and fresh air is essential for wellbeing; if you can, take some time outside (while following government guidance), or sit by an open window. </p>\n<p>Continue to take any medication you are on – remember you can order repeat prescriptions by telephone and can usually ask for delivery, or someone you trust to collect it for you.</p>\n<p>LUU's Health and Wellbeing Ambassadors are also sending out a regular ‘dose of happiness’ which you can sign up for. You may also want to have a read of helpful articles from students about dealing with the situation. </p>\n<p>Keeping moving</p>\n<p>Even if it is just little and often, staying active will really help to boost your mood. Our Sports and Physical Activity service has launched a new fitness and wellbeing hub: ‘your home, your move’. Two fitness videos have been added so far, and more content (including posts about sleep, nutrition, fitness and routine) on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, every week.</p>\n<p>Join online</p>\n<p>There’s lots of great online activities you can join. Check out your favourite social media sites for yoga and fitness routines, cook-alongs, sing-alongs and dance-alongs, or try out a 10 minute NHS workout.</p>\n<p>Our social media team has also put together this great blog on using technology to stay social.</p>\n<p>Keep learning</p>\n<p>Learning new skills and things can help boost your self-confidence and raise self-esteem, so this is a great time to think about what you can give a go for the first time. Take time to be creative (maybe you can discover new talents or nurture some of those old ones?).  Listen to new Podcasts, or TED Talks that you’ve always wanted to try, or take a look at Pinterest for loads of ideas for things to do around the home and garden.</p>\n<p>Take Notice</p>\n<p>When we feel really overwhelmed, we can find it hard think, make decisions and know what to do next. We often find it hard to be in the ‘here and now’ – here’s a quick tip (and a little challenge) you can try anywhere to help you reconnect:</p>\n<p>Slow your breathing. Take some nice, slow even breaths. Notice: five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can touch, two things you can smell, one thing you can taste. Reconnect with the here and now. </p>\n<p>You may also find the following resources helpful:\nProgressive Muscle Relaxation\nMind Relaxing and Calming Exercises\nPixelThought</p>\n<p>Get the support you need</p>\n<p>University support</p>\n<p>We know that the coronavirus situation is overwhelming for many and that you may need additional support. There is a lot of support being put in place which you can access remotely. If you need help and support with non-academic issues, get in touch your Schools and student support officers.</p>\n<p>For those of you who are still with us in Leeds, please regularly check our campus service updates page for information about what’s open. Please note: As of 2pm today (Friday 27 March), all catering outlets on campus, including The Refectory, are now closed until further notice. Please be assured that the small number of students reliant on the University for meals are being catered for.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about your accommodation, see the accommodation services FAQs or contact the accommodation services directly. </p>\n<p>Financial support </p>\n<p>We recognise that many of you may have financial concerns due to what’s going on around us. The Leeds Hardship Fund is available to those of you who may need financial support. We know many students are away from campus at the moment, and so you can request a form by emailing the Funding team. Please include your name and student ID in the email. If you are eligible to apply, you will be sent an application form by email, along with further instructions. If your financial hardship relates directly to changed circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 situation please state this clearly within the email. Details about your situation can then be provided as part of the application supporting statement. Please email the team directly if you have any questions: funding@leeds.ac.uk.</p>\n<p>Additional financial support may be available to you through the Government and LUU. </p>\n<p>Other support services</p>\n<p>Lots of you may have mixed feeling about everything that’s going on in the world. Please take time to talk through these with your friends, family, classmates or flatmates. Sometimes it’s easier to share these feelings with someone who doesn’t know you personally.

We know you have questions about your studies with us and we want to reassure you of our commitment to providing the support you need to succeed. We are hugely grateful for all the comments, suggestions and concerns you are raising with us directly, by email, through Leeds University Union (LUU), through your Schools and Tutors and your Course Reps. Thanks for letting us know where things are going well and where we can improve things, and also for helping us to understand the particular circumstances you find yourselves in.</p>\n<p>Because of the understandable volume of enquiries and petitions, and the practical difficulties of remote working, I’m afraid we are not going to be able to respond to emails individually. All the emails that come in are being read, and they have contributed to the continued development of our thinking. </p>\n<p>Continuing to learn together\nWe know that each of you may be facing quite different situations at the moment. As well as your studies, you may have other responsibilities, such as caring for friends or family. We sincerely hope not, but you may be ill yourself. We understand. It is helpful for us all to acknowledge that it will take a bit of time to establish and become accustomed to new ways of learning together, appreciating that it will feel different for different students (and indeed for your teachers). </p>\n<p>Support for your academic journey\nOur priority is to ensure that you are supported. A key element of our approach at Leeds has always been personal tutoring. So, following consultation with LUU, we’ve agreed that you will receive more regular contact from a member of our academic community, with contact at least every two weeks, to check on your progress with online teaching, your preparation for any assessments and your plans for next year.\nIn many cases, this will be the personal tutor you are used to hearing from (though you may know them by a different title, such as ‘development tutor’ or ‘academic support lead’). In other cases, we will ask another colleague to become your main contact for academic support. This is part of our planning to ensure that we can dedicate time to be in such regular contact.\nYou will appreciate that we are needing to consider different scenarios for your teachers too – they may now have children learning at home, or they or a member of their household may become unwell, for example, so we need to take a whole community approach.</p>\n<p>Answering your questions\nWe have created a series of frequently asked questions (FAQs) on the dedicated coronavirus website. We are updating this information regularly so that webpage should always be your first point of reference. If you haven’t yet read the FAQs, please take a look and familiarise yourself with the arrangements we are putting in place to support your education. Learning and teaching will continue online after Easter and we will do everything we can to support you to engage with those learning opportunities, no matter what your circumstances.  </p>\n<p>Thinking ahead about assessments\nIn our message to all students and staff on 17 March (Student-education-arrangements), we laid out the approach we will be taking to assessments. Please read these ‘student education arrangements’ carefully so that you understand what this means for you.  If we already make reasonable adjustments  for your assessments, Disability Services and your School will think through how these might apply to the new arrangements. \nTo ensure that the value of your degree is maintained, there will be a review of all assessment plans, taking account of the many different situations and support needs that our students may have. We are committed to completing this (and confirming the outcome to you) by 17 April at the latest.</p>\n<p>Mitigating Circumstances\nPlease don’t forget that your Schools are used to adapting assessments for individual students who have to cope with difficult circumstances. We hope the changes we are making will make it possible for most students to continue with their studies this academic year but, if for whatever reason you’re not able to do this, we will protect your interests and ensure that you are able to progress and graduate. We consider the current situation to be mitigating circumstances for all students, but please contact your School as normal using the Mitigating Circumstances Procedure if you wish your School to consider factors which relate to your own individual position.</p>\n<p>Progression and Classification\nAs we have already outlined, unless there are specific professional accreditation requirements, all students will be able to progress from their current level of study. We will work hard to support you at your next level to ensure you are able to cope with the demands of that study next year. Please do not worry if you think you won’t have enough credits, or that your marks are not as good as they should have been.\nThis year final year students will be classified in accordance with our existing Rules for Award. For first degrees, this means we will take into account your performance in previous years. Additionally, Assessment Boards will consider your classification under special circumstances discretion, recognising the challenges you have faced this year. \nIn 2020/21 we expect that undergraduate first degrees will be classified on final year marks only, so poor results this year should not affect your overall classification. However, if you do well in your assessments this year, this will be taken into consideration in calculating your final classification.   </p>\n<p>Support available online\nIf you need help and support, we are here for you, but in order to enable our colleagues to comply with the government instruction to stay at home, you’ll need to access support online or by email. You can contact your School support team using the usual email address. You can also access support through LUU and Support Services via email or online.\nFor support with learning online and for any questions you have about learning resources, systems or tools available, please contact our dedicated helpdesk at digitaleducation@leeds.ac.uk. </p>\n<p>Thank you again for how well you have responded to this extraordinary set of circumstances. Do please maintain contact with your school, personal tutor, and with each other.

The policy on video stream is available to download. If you prefer to postpone and rearrange your viva, we will be happy to support this.  In addition, we are moving to online thesis submission only.  Theses should be submitted via GRAD as a PDF; bound hard copies are not required.  The date of submission will be recorded as the date that the PDF was uploaded to GRAD.  Once again, your Graduate School can provide advice and support on all these matters. </p>\n<p>If the current situation means that you are not going to be able to meet the deadlines for transfer submission or final thesis submission, please apply for an extension.  All such requests will be considered sympathetically.  Graduate Schools can advise, once again.</p>\n<p>International PGRs on Tier IV visas</p>\n<p>If you choose to return home, rather than remaining in the UK, we will of course continue to support you as well as we can. Although we have stopped international travel on University business on the basis that such travel might contribute to the spread of infection, travel home does of course have to be a personal decision.</p>\n<p>If you wish to return home, but will be continuing to progress your research and complete supervision meetings, you will need to complete a ‘Change of Study Location’ workflow in GRAD.  This is so that the Graduate School knows your whereabouts and can support you during this period.  Supervision meetings can continue as outlined above, and should be recorded in GRAD.</p>\n<p>If you choose to return home but will be unable to progress your research remotely and supervision meetings cannot continue, or if you require a break from your studies for personal reasons, you can take an authorised absence or a suspension of studies, both of which can be applied for using GRAD.  Your Graduate School can advise as to which is most appropriate in your particular circumstances.</p>\n<p>PGRs who teach</p>\n<p>If you are a PGR who teaches or demonstrates, please contact the module leader for the modules on which you teach for advice in the first instance.  FAQs are being prepared and will be available on the coronavirus website.

Do speak with your school if you have specific questions about what this means for you.</p>\n<p>I know it is tempting to want a simple headline but, in fact, the circumstances of individual students vary enormously.

There will be no resit exams for these students in August.</p>\n<p>There will be an assessment and progression point during or at the end of Semester 1 in the following year of study.</p>\n<p>Teaching and learning will continue online now and after Easter – it is important that you keep engaging with this to complete your studies this year and to ensure that you are prepared for study next year. We will also be releasing summer exam papers or other assessments for you to do online as formative assessments, with helpful feedback which will support you as you move into your next year of study.</p>\n<p>For all other undergraduate students, Schools will confirm for each programme whether further assessments are required in order for you to progress in your studies. These may include online, open-book assessments or an alternative form of online assessment such as an essay, report or other task.</p>\n<p>For postgraduate taught students, programme level intended learning outcomes from the taught component of your course will be reviewed by your School. Where any learning outcomes have not been delivered or assessed, this may be built into a revised dissertation or project plan. Dissertations and projects will be reviewed by Schools so these can be completed, submitted and assessed online.</p>\n<p>All students who have a Disability Advisory and Support Service (DASS) plan will continue to be supported, with appropriate adjustments made where needed. The communication from Schools will include details about disability support recommendations and advice about what to do if you feel you need further support.</p>\n<p>The Library has migrated as many of its services as possible to its digital platforms. You will find Library staff online and there to help. We have the largest eBook collections in the UK and have diverted all our print budgets to purchasing digital editions. Visit the Library website for more information.</p>\n<p>I recognise that these changes will represent a greater challenge for some students than for others in terms of access to computer equipment, Internet access, or access to quiet study space, for example. We will continue to work with our support services and the Students’ Union to try to address these issues – but we recognise this is not straightforward.</p>\n<p>As I hope you appreciate, we are doing everything we can to make sure your teaching and progression to your qualification can continue. We will be providing extensive support to you over the coming days and weeks as we look to change the way you are assessed and taught.</p>\n<p>We are also considering the implications of current events for this summer’s graduation ceremonies and we will update all graduating students by the start of April.</p>\n<p>I know you will be worried, not only about your studies, but the wider situation.

The Government is working closely with the HE sector on a wide range of issues, and student wellbeing is at the heart of those discussions.</p>\n<p>Students in residence halls in England</p>\n<p>While many students will already have travelled home, I know that those of you who have not, or cannot, will be concerned about what you should do now.</p>\n<p>The Government’s advice is that students remaining at university in England should now stay where they are and not attempt to travel. If you are living in student halls, or private rented accommodation, you should remain there and stay indoors while current restrictions are in force. As the Prime Minister said, staying put and remaining indoors is a crucial step now to slow the rate of transmission of COVID-19, to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed, and save the lives of fellow citizens. The government published advice on staying at home here: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/full-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/full-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others</a></p>\n<p>Should you or any of your friends fall ill while in your student residence, there is guidance on self-isolating here: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings</a></p>\n<p>I have been discussing with HE providers the additional support that they can give to students. That includes continuing to provide accommodation for those who cannot travel home or have no alternative residence. Providers will also offer a range of other support services to students, including catering and cleaning, and also student health and welfare. We know that providers are bolstering their existing mental health services, and adapting delivery to means other than face-to-face, and these services are likely to be an important source of support for you during this period of isolation. My department is also talking with HE providers to consider how we can offer additional mental health support.</p>\n<p>Finals</p>\n<p>I am very aware that many of you will be worried about what this means for final exams.</p>\n<p>The Office for Students will produce guidance shortly on practical you can complete your studies whilst ensuring quality and standards are maintained. This will cover teaching, continued learning and assessment during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>It is important that providers support you and enable you to leave with qualifications that have real value and that reflects your hard work and allow you to progress. I can assure you that we are working closely with the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) to ensure this happens.</p>\n<p>Visas</p>\n<p>On Tuesday 24 March, the Home Office updated their visa guidance to provide greater certainty for international higher education students and staff in the UK currently unable to return home due to COVID-19. This covers three main issues: visa extensions, in-country visa switching and distance learning.</p>\n<p>Visa extensions</p>\n<p>No individual who is in the UK legally, but whose visa is due to expire, or has already expired, and who cannot leave because of travel restrictions related to COVID-19, will be regarded as an ‘over-stayer’, or suffer any detriment in the future.</p>\n<p>Anyone whose leave expired after the 24 January and who cannot leave the country because of travel restrictions or self-isolation will have their visas extended to 31 May 2020. Individuals must contact the Coronavirus Immigration Team email to advise of their situation – please see contact details further down.</p>\n<p>In-country visa switching</p>\n<p>Individuals (students or staff) who cannot leave the UK due to travel restrictions or self-isolation and wish to stay in the UK in the long-term would ordinarily need to apply for a visa from their home country. Where individuals would normally be required to return to their country of residence to apply for a visa in a different category, they’ll now be able to apply from the UK to switch.</p>\n<p>Distance learning</p>\n<p>Tier 4 students are not normally permitted to undertake distance learning courses. However, due to the current exceptional circumstances, the Home Office will not consider it a breach of sponsor duties to offer distance learning to existing Tier 4 students in the UK or who have chosen to return overseas but wish to continue their current studies. Sponsors do not need to withdraw sponsorship in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>New international students who have been issued a Tier 4 visa but have been unable to travel to the UK are permitted to undertake distance learning and sponsorship does not need to be withdrawn.</p>\n<p>New international students who have not yet applied for a visa but wish to commence a course by distance learning do not need to travel to the UK to do so and therefore do not require sponsorship under Tier 4.</p>\n<p>Further information from the Home Office</p>\n<p>Full details covering the above visa issues above can be found at the following link: www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents</p>\n<p>The Home Office’s Coronavirus Immigration Helpline remains open: 0800 678 1767 (open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm – calls are free of charge if made from within the UK). The Home Office asks that customers check gov.uk first as that is the central source of information, but if individuals remain concerned about their immigration status they can contact: CIH@homeoffice.gov.uk.</p>\n<p>Call for Volunteers</p>\n<p>Universities are in the front line in the immediate challenge of the COVID-19 virus. There are many ways that universities will be able to contribute to the fight against the virus, including making their facilities and expertise available.</p>\n<p>You may already know people with medical or healthcare knowledge who are involved in fighting COVID-19 and there will be opportunities for more people to do so. The Health Minister this week launched a call for volunteers to support vulnerable people to stay safe and well at home.</p>\n<p>If you would like to get involved, you can sign up as a NHS volunteer here:<a href=\"https://www.goodsamapp.org/NHS\">https://www.goodsamapp.org/NHS</a></p>\n<p>Finances</p>\n<p>I would like to assure you that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is planning to make Term 3 tuition fee payments as scheduled and that you will continue to receive maintenance payments on the scheduled dates, whether or not campuses are closed or learning has moved online. We expect that providers will communicate clearly with residential students on rents for this period and administer accommodation provision in a fair manner.</p>\n<p>I am also aware that some students are facing financial difficulties as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak. The Government is working closely with the HE sector on a wide range of issues, and student wellbeing is at the heart of those discussions. It will be a matter for universities themselves to deal with individual students’ situations. We understand that most universities maintain hardship funds, which can be deployed where necessary. You should also be aware that if you are on a PAYE contract (e.g. part time student work), you may still get 80% of normal income. The guidance is here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses</a></p>\n<p>I hope that you find this helpful and informative. We will continue to work with the sector and with student representatives (Student Unions and the NUS).

If this would be of aid to you, or if there is anything more we can do, then please let me know via Covid19enquiries@ncl.ac.uk and we will do what we can to support you.</p>\n<p>To remind you, NUSU have set up a Covid-19 Community Facebook group (Newcastle University: Covid-19 Community) and pastoral support is available from Student Health and Wellbeing via email: pastoral.support@ncl.ac.uk</p>\n<p>For those of you who were planning to go home in the next few days, we have checked with Public Health England and they have said that this constitutes essential travel, so you are free to do so.</p>\n<p>Changes to assessment</p>\n<p>I am aware from your questions that many of you are keen to have information about the approach we are taking to assessment in Semester 2.</p>\n<p>In these circumstances there is no perfect solution, but what has been approved by the University’s Executive Board, following consultation with the NUSU sabbatical officers, is a pragmatic response that balances the need to ensure:</p>\n<p>the integrity of our/your degrees and the value of our/your awards;</p>\n<p>an appropriate level of student engagement with the learning opportunities we are providing now that we have moved to remote delivery;</p>\n<p>trying not to over-burden our students and staff</p>\n<p>I appreciate that you are also likely to be aware of other Universities’ approaches to assessment of their students in these challenging times. Each institution, like our own, will be taking difficult decisions, which reflect local circumstances and priorities. For us the continued engagement of you, our taught students, is a priority since you have just under 4 weeks of your learning and teaching timetable still to complete. It is essential that you have opportunities to engage with your teaching but also have the opportunities through assessment to continue to engage and receive feedback on your learning.</p>\n<p>The approach</p>\n<p>All students in all stages will undergo assessment during Semester 2, and, at present, the dates of the examination period remain unchanged as follows:</p>\n<p>Monday 18 May 2020 to Friday 5 June 2020</p>\n<p>(including Saturday 23 May and Saturday 30 May).</p>\n<p>If it is necessary to make any changes to these dates, you will be notified as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Please note: Exam dates for programmes with external accreditation may vary. Please await further information your school.</p>\n<p>All assessments will take place remotely (no face to face on-campus examinations).</p>\n<p>We have asked each school / subject to choose one of the two following options for delivery of exam-based assessments remaining for each module in the remainder of this academic year:</p>\n<p>An alternative assessment: This would replace the exams currently scheduled with a piece of coursework, assessing those learning outcomes that have not been assessed. A 24 hour “take home exam”: This will be made available to students to download through Blackboard, the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), with students submitting their answers through the VLE.</p>\n<p>More detailed information on these options, and the many questions I’m sure you’ll have, are available in the Frequently Asked Questions. The approach is a University-wide position, which will be implemented flexibly and pragmatically in each schools/subject area. We are aware that there are a number of issues linked to this approach that will need further consideration –discussions will take place in the next two weeks after which, staff in your school / subject area will contact you to give you more information.</p>\n<p>For students who are experiencing particular issues, those who get ill as a result of this situation or who have difficult personal circumstances that may affect their examinations, the FAQs give more information on the different forms that will be available for you to tell us, so that we can take appropriate action.</p>\n<p>Graduation Ceremonies</p>\n<p>In my message last Tuesday (17 March) I told you about the postponement of the summer graduation ceremonies until later in the year, given the likelihood that the disruption caused by Covid-19 is likely to extend beyond the examination period.</p>\n<p>We are now planning for ceremonies to be held at the end of November/early December 2020 by which time we anticipate (hope) that major restrictions in terms of social distancing and travel will have been removed.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned last week, you’re not required to attend a ceremony in order to graduate – the ceremony is just to celebrate your achievements. Our plan is to issue the formal degree parchments as planned in summer 2020, with hard copies of degree parchments posted out to students. We will give you more information closer to the time.</p>\n<p>Computing clusters closed</p>\n<p>Public Health England this morning advised us that we must now close all our computer clusters and the King’s Gate building for physical access. We recognise that this may create issues for students who may not have access to computing facilities.</p>\n<p>Self-care</p>\n<p>Finally, we know that the current situation has meant a significant change for everyone as well as a loss of routine and an increase in the unknown, all of which can be stressful. It is vital therefore that you look after yourself at a time like this. As you know, our Student Health and Wellbeing Services are all available to you remotely, but not everyone will want or need to access formal therapy. You may be interested instead in the iNCLude app which comes recommended by our Wellbeing team. It has many new features specifically developed to help you adapt to this new situation. You may also want to take advantage of our online CBT platform, Silvercloud, which provides you with techniques designed to help you manage stress and anxiety.</p>\n<p>An important part of self-care is staying active. Sport England have released some workouts you can do indoors, so you may want to visit their website for some suggestions on how to stay active.</p>\n<p>Remember for those of you close to campus, the Coop store NUSU remains open to provide essential supplies to students and staff. All other NUSU services are available online only.</p>\n<p>If you have any further questions that are not addressed by my emails or the FAQs, please get in touch at: Covid19enquiries@ncl.ac.uk</p>\n<p>With best wishes,</p>\n<p>Lucy Backhurst</p>\n<p>Academic Registrar</p>","id":"12e2cb96-ac74-520f-9f09-f8d3c48ab6a2","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-ncl/2020-04-08-23_24_39/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Student and Staff Wellbeing"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>Dear students,</p>\n<p>Over the past few days we have received a lot of emails from you asking questions about accommodation, computing clusters and careers support. Today’s email aims to answer those questions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Students in University-owned accommodation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For students still living in University-owned accommodation</p>\n<p>As you know, we have advised those students who are able to return home, to do so. We know that some students, particularly our international students, are not able to go home for a variety of reasons. You may be interested in reading guidance produced by the Department for Education specifically for students still living in University accommodation.</p>\n<p>Starting today, if you are still living in University accommodation you will be called by a member of staff in Student Services to check you are OK and make sure you have the support you need. As I’m sure you will appreciate, our staff, just like the whole UK population, have been instructed to minimise face to face contact and avoid coming into work if possible. This will leave us with a skeleton team in Accommodation Services to provide you with limited services, but please be assured, we will do everything we can physically and remotely, to help you through this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Your accommodation contract will continue and you will remain liable for the accommodation fees until the end of your contract. We will contact you to advise you on the options for making payment of fees. We know that many of you will be worried about not being able to pay fees or not having enough money for food and other bills. We can work this out with you and agree appropriate payment plans for you. If you have not already completed our “Students staying in residence” form, please do, so we can continue to support you through these challenging times.</p>\n<p>For students who have left University-owned accommodation by 29 March 2020</p>\n<p>If you have left, or are planning to leave University-owned accommodation by Sunday 29 March, we will suspend future direct debit collections. For those paying monthly, collection was due on 1 April. For those of you paying termly, collection was due on 7 May. We will not be asking for this payment.</p>\n<p>For students in University-owned accommodation who have left and cleared their rooms</p>\n<p>If you have been able to follow our advice to return home, have emptied your room and returned your keys, you will be released from your contract at the end of this academic term, 29 March. No further fees will be due.</p>\n<p>For students in University-owned accommodation who have left, but have not been able to clear their room</p>\n<p>If you have left University-owned accommodation but not been able to empty your room you will not be charged for the final term. If you have not already completed our “Students returning home” form, please do so and confirm that you have left your belongings. We will contact you at a later date when we have a better idea of when you may be able to return to Newcastle.</p>\n<p>For students who have paid accommodation fees in advance</p>\n<p>If you paid your accommodation fees in advance at the beginning of the academic year, you will receive a refund of the rent paid for Term 3. At this stage as we are dealing with the implications of Coronavirus and are managing new ways of working in line with Government guidelines, we are not in a position to refund students immediately. Please be assured that we will have the team working to ensure all refunds are processed as quickly as possible, once staff are able to return to work.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Students Living in Partnership accommodation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For students living in Partnership accommodation such as Abodus, Downing, Liberty and Unite, we are liaising with partners to ascertain what process they will follow in light of the University’s approach. When we know more, you will be contacted with further information. Again, it is important that we know if you are returning home or staying in residence and we would ask that if you haven’t already advised us of your intentions, please complete the relevant forms.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Students living in private accommodation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As advised in the message I sent on 20 March, if you are living in private accommodation in Newcastle, we advise you to monitor Government guidance about the support that is available to protect you. You may also want to speak to your landlord and, if you are at risk of eviction or in hardship, contact our financial support team via their webpage.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Computer cluster availability on campus</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following computer clusters remain open for students still in Newcastle:</p>\n<p>Hadrian Cluster (Hadrian Building)</p>\n<p>Fell Cluster (Med School)</p>\n<p>You will need your smartcard to gain access to these clusters which are available 24/7. We will review the position relating to our clusters daily, depending on usage and Government guidance.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Careers Support</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Students can access information, advice and guidance through MyCareer about careers, CVs, applications, Start-Up and any other queries relating to your next steps. The team are on hand (virtually) to help with any of your questions and we can arrange for an advisor to have an online meeting with you if you would like to chat to someone.</p>\n<p>We have lots of great online resources, available through our website including practice psychometric testing, online interview simulator and top tips on CVs, applications, career planning and job searching.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>And finally</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Regrettably, I am writing with a note of warning for those of you living in Jesmond. We have received a report of a spate of burglaries in the area. The neighbourhood Inspector has been notified and police are monitoring the situation, but please be vigilant and if you’re leaving Newcastle, take valuables with you and lock up well.</p>\n<p>Look after yourselves during these difficult times. Please listen and adhere to Government and NHS guidance to keep us all safe.</p>\n<p>As ever, the information in this email together with more information for students on issues such as tuition fees, IT support and keeping well, will be included in our FAQs.</p>\n<p>Take good care,</p>\n<p>Lucy Backhurst</p>\n<p>Academic Registrar</p>","id":"78ec2ae2-a24b-5ad7-affd-8e58e4d45134","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-ncl/2020-04-08-23_25_00/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Student and Staff Wellbeing"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>Dear students,</p>\n<p>You will now have heard the recent advice that the UK Government is taking with regard to Covid 19.

We know from your emails and petitions that this is a cause of great anxiety for many of you just now, and we are listening. This week, we have developed a Safety Net proposal which will be considered by our Academic Governing body, Senate, and the outcome will be communicated to taught programme students on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>IT support for students</p>\n<p>Following the University’s move to remote teaching and assessment, we recognise that some of you may find yourselves in a position of having no or very limited access to IT facilities that are essential to continue your studies over this period.</p>\n<p>If you do not have a computer, laptop or other device you can use for studying right now, or have no or very limited access to an internet connection and are currently in receipt of financial hardship support, you may be eligible for support with IT equipment. The University currently has a limited number of laptops available to loan to Newcastle University students. These will be distributed on a case-by-case basis but I urge you to consider your own needs carefully before making a request; if you take one and don’t need it then it may deprive someone who does.</p>\n<p>To request support for IT equipment, you must complete the following online Student IT request form. The form helps us to gather the information we need from you to process your request and to help us fully understand your requirements. Please be assured we will do all that we can to support your studies. We will endeavour to keep you up to date with the progress of your request.</p>\n<p>If your request is successful, at present, the University will be able to provide:</p>\n<p>A short-term loan of a University-issued laptop until September 2020, to students currently residing in the UK OR an I.T. grant to non-UK based students to purchase a suitable device</p>\n<p>an I.T. grant to non-UK based students to purchase a suitable device An I.T. grant up to £200 to purchase short-term internet access.</p>\n<p>If your request is for software which is essential for you to be able to complete an assessment but you are unable to download and install it, or it won’t run on your device, please log a request via our IT service desk at <a href=\"https://nuservice.ncl.ac.uk/\">https://nuservice.ncl.ac.uk/</a>.</p>\n<p>For advice on the software provision that is available to you as a student, visit <a href=\"http://go.ncl.ac.uk/itservice/softwareforstudents\">http://go.ncl.ac.uk/itservice/softwareforstudents</a></p>\n<p>Please be aware that there are global supply problems with IT devices (laptops, tablets etc.) and priority in the UK is currently being given to the NHS which may lead to some delay in providing resources if your request is approved. We will do everything that we can to get kit to you as quickly as possible, but as I’m sure you will understand in this situation, there are some factors which are outside of our control.</p>\n<p>Support for Students Experiencing Financial Difficulties</p>\n<p>We are aware too that many students may have lost their part time jobs or other sources of income as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. I’d like to remind you that if you are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the current disruption, you may eligible for support from the University’s Hardship Fund. Further information can be found on the Student Financial Support website. As I’m sure you can appreciate, the team are receiving a high number of applications but they are aiming to respond within 5 working days.</p>\n<p>Sports Centre Membership Refunds</p>\n<p>All students who are members of the Sports Centre, will receive a refund for the remaining months of the academic year. Sport Services will send further information directly to members in the next 14 days. Students with an accommodation package sports centre membership will receive a refund alongside their adjusted accommodation contract.</p>\n<p>Students still in University Accommodation</p>\n<p>Following last Friday’s Government announcement that any students still living in halls or privately rented accommodation must now stay where they are and not attempt to travel, I wanted to take the opportunity to reach out to any of you who have not been in contact with us already to check that you have the support you need to get through the next few weeks in lockdown.</p>\n<p>Many of our students have gone home already, but we know a significant number of you are still in Newcastle. We have contacted all students in our halls of residence and, as we approach the Easter break we want to make sure that those of you living in private accommodation have everything you need to keep safe and well and be able to continue with your studies.</p>\n<p>To help with this, we’ve put together this handy support guide setting out the support available to you, but we would also like to hear from you and I’d be grateful if you could take the time to fill in this online form and let us know where you are and how you are doing. Remember, wherever you are living you should stay there, and only go out in line with government advice to keep yourselves and others safe.</p>\n<p>Accommodation Contracts</p>\n<p>We have been working closely with our accommodation partner providers to encourage them to follow the University’s approach and release from contracts those of you who have followed both University and government advice to return home.</p>\n<p>Unite Students, which now incorporate Liberty Living, have followed the University’s approach.</p>\n<p>We are continuing to negotiate with both Abodus Students (Portland Green Student Village) and Downing. Conversations with Abodus have been extremely positive and we’re hoping for some good news later this week. We are still in discussion with Downing about their approach and will keep you updated on progress.</p>\n<p>Other purpose-built student accommodation providers are also considering their approach, with some already making the decision to release students from their contractual liability.</p>\n<p>For those of you living in privately owned houses of multiple occupation we would encourage you to liaise with your landlord or letting agent. We remind you to monitor government guidance about the support that is available to protect you and, if you are at risk of eviction or in hardship please contact our financial support team via their webpage.</p>\n<p>University Accommodation Reception Services</p>\n<p>Our face-to-face reception services remain suspended in order to protect the health of our residents and staff, but we’re continuing to support our residents via telephone and email as follows:</p>\n<p>Bowsden Court and St Mary’s College 08.00 – 12.00</p>\n<p>Park View, Castle Leazes and Kensington Terrace 10.00 – 16.00</p>\n<p>For emergencies outside of these times, please contact Estate Security Service on 0191 208 6817</p>\n<p>We will keep residents updated of any changes to the above times by email.</p>\n<p>Accommodation Health and Safety</p>\n<p>Accommodation Services are continuing vital health and safety checks across our residences. These checks are in line with usual procedures throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Social distancing in accommodation and ResLife support</p>\n<p>Accommodation Services have received a lot of questions about how to maintain social distancing in University accommodation. Please remember that you should:</p>\n<p>Remain in your room to distance yourself from others and when using common areas maintain a safe distance of 2m between you and others</p>\n<p>Avoid gatherings of more than 2 people</p>\n<p>Only leave your accommodation to go shopping for essential groceries and/or medication or to exercise once per day and, whilst you are out, you should maintain the minimum distance of 2 metres from other people.</p>\n<p>The ResLife Team is available to answer any questions you might have. Please contact the Team via: ResLife@newcastle.ac.uk.</p>\n<p>Email Scams</p>\n<p>Times of crisis and confusion are an ideal opportunity for email scammers to catch people off-guard. We know that scammers are targeting medical research facilities with Covid-19 themed phishing emails, fake apps and web advertising. There is also a phishing email circulating which suggests “You have a new document from OneDrive”. It may appear to be from a friend or colleague, but it is not genuine and should just be deleted. If you’ve deleted it, there’s no need to tell us. If you’re unsure, contact the IT Service Desk.</p>\n<p>Industrial Action Impact Form Deadline</p>\n<p>Following a number of requests from students and in recognition of the fact that many of you may not have had an opportunity to complete the form as a result of the recent disruption, the deadline for completing the Industrial Action Impact Form has been extended to 5pm on Friday 10 April (Good Friday). Please use this form to advise us of disruption due to industrial action only. Separate arrangements will be put in place for you to advise us of disruption caused by Covid-19.</p>\n<p>Community Update and Further Information</p>\n<p>Finally I just want to say how proud we are of the many ways our student and colleague community has been coming together, stepping up and showing support for one another over the past couple of weeks.

We have already moved to full online or virtual delivery, ensuring modules continue to be taught – albeit remotely.</p>\n<p>Online assessment</p>\n<p>The University has temporarily adapted its usual central processes so that assessment can be completed remotely, supported by a new set of COVID-19 Exceptional Regulations. How this affects you personally will depend on your area of study and – like methods of online teaching – will vary from module to module. Your Schools and Faculties are currently working on how they will assess students’ work, and will be in touch with you directly with more detail on this.</p>\n<p>All tutors, regardless of Faculty, are working to the same principles while developing new methods of assessment.</p>\n<p>We want you to succeed\nYou will not be tested on areas that can’t be taught under the current conditions\nWe will stagger assessment over a longer period than usual, extending until Friday 12 June\nYour assessment load will not be increased\nWe will prioritise your wellbeing\nWe will ensure that you meet the learning outcomes of your programme, and that you will meet the requirements of affiliated professional bodies</p>\n<p>How will this work?</p>\n<p>As we said, we are still working through the detail of how this will work in every case. However, the following general rules will apply to many of you. These general rules cover University of Nottingham UK students, regardless of current location. Your School will let you know if you are an exception to these general rules when they contact you about your specific assessment.</p>\n<p>In modules where 40% of your assessment has been completed, or is already in progress, the marks you receive for those assessments will be your final module mark. Schools will be in touch to confirm if and how this ‘part for whole’ approach applies to you.</p>\n<p>The regulations allow a flexible approach to the setting of substitute assessment. This could include coursework, open book exams, recorded presentations or other methods. In a small number of cases, Schools will use ROGO for assessments via remote access. You will be informed directly if this affects you.</p>\n<p>There will be a further assessment period before the start of the next academic year.

I very much hope that you and your family and friends are safe and well.</p>\n<p>We know that all of you are worried about the prospect of sitting examinations and completing other assessments in these extraordinary circumstances, and that you are concerned about your ability to undertake assessments to the standard that you wish to achieve.</p>\n<p>We strongly believe that where possible, engaging with remote delivery of teaching and completing all remaining assessments to the best of your ability in the current circumstances are in your best interests. This was reinforced to us in the guidance we received last Friday from our Regulator, the Office for Students, when they said that universities should make all reasonable efforts to enable students to complete their studies, for achievement to be reliably assessed, for qualifications to be awarded securely.</p>\n<p>However, we recognise that these are exceptional circumstances, and so, for this academic year only, we will introduce a Safety Net for our students that will apply to all taught students in all years of study in respect of their assessment, progression, awards and classifications.</p>\n<p>The Safety Net approach, developed in partnership with our Sabbatical Officers in order to take account of the student voice, builds on the approach to assessment outlined in the email from the Academic Registrar on 24 March 2020.</p>\n<p>We believe that a Safety Net, in conjunction with the package of other mitigating measures that we have or will put in place, will support all students to continue studying for their awards, knowing that the University will acknowledge and take account of the wide range of circumstances in which students currently find themselves.</p>\n<p>Safety Net Policy for undergraduates and students on integrated masters programmes</p>\n<p>The undergraduate and integrated masters safety net means that you cannot be disadvantaged by your performance in your semester 2 of 2019-20 assessments, provided that you meet the learning outcomes for your programme by achieving the normal requirements in respect of the amount of credit awarded for your Semester 2 modules. In other words, you need to pass your remaining modules for the Safety Net to apply at the end of the academic year.</p>\n<p>For undergraduate students at all stages, and students on integrated masters programmes, the Safety Net will recognise the prior academic achievement of each student through a verified ‘baseline average’ of academic performance calculated at the end of Semester 1 of 2019-20.</p>\n<p>We will continue to provide students with the opportunity to fulfil their potential by allowing them only to improve upon their baseline academic average by undertaking Semester 2 of 2019-20 assessments, and maintain the value and credibility of our programmes by ensuring that students are able to meet the learning outcomes of their programmes. Students will still need to complete and pass their assessments in line with University and programme regulations.</p>\n<p>This means that completing the summer assessments can only help and not hinder students, because we will not let the extraordinary circumstances in which students are completing these assessments leave them with a mark below their current baseline average at the end of Semester 1 of 2019-20.</p>\n<p>Further information on how the baseline average will be calculated for students in each stage is provided in the Frequently Asked Questions.</p>\n<p>Safety net for postgraduate taught students</p>\n<p>For postgraduate taught students, the Safety Net will by necessity operate differently, because taught postgraduate programmes are significantly different in structure and length to undergraduate and integrated masters programmes. Postgraduate taught students should read the Frequently Asked Questions to understand how this operates.</p>\n<p>We recognise that there are many different types of PGT programmes (part-time, apprenticeships etc) and that the principle of the Safety Net, that a student’s performance will not be academically disadvantaged by Covid-19, will be adhered to for our postgraduate taught students.</p>\n<p>Programmes with external accreditation</p>\n<p>For a number of undergraduate, integrated masters and postgraduate taught programmes with external professional accreditation, students will not automatically be eligible for the Safety Net. Many accrediting bodies seek to protect professional entry standards, requiring that students pass modules and programmes to demonstrate that learning outcomes have been met sufficiently.</p>\n<p>If you are studying an accredited programme, further details will be confirmed to you as soon as possible following discussion with the relevant accrediting bodies. Students on accredited programmes are asked to remember that the decisions of external accrediting bodies are not in the University’s control, but please be assured we will do what we can to support your interests.</p>\n<p>Other mitigating measures in place over the Covid-19 period</p>\n<p>The Safety Net is an extraordinary measure that we are introducing in unprecedented times, to support students universally affected by Covid-19 disruption.</p>\n<p>In introducing it, we recognise that there are many students who are having to cope with additional challenges in their personal circumstances, which make undertaking assessment in the coming months challenging or, in some cases, impossible.</p>\n<p>We understand that such students have different needs and require additional mitigation, so we will use existing and new measures to enable us to understand their circumstances and make appropriate adjustments.</p>\n<p>Personal Extenuating Circumstances</p>\n<p>Many students will already be familiar with the Personal Extenuating Circumstances (PEC) process, a process that enables students to tell us if they have additional personal or individual circumstances that require specific adjustments to be made to assessment, such as extension to deadlines.</p>\n<p>For the duration of Covid-19, the University will put in place a simplified PEC mitigation process whereby all Covid-19 and all health-related issues will not require additional supporting evidence, so that we can understand and take into account the personal circumstances in which students are undertaking their assessments.</p>\n<p>Covid-19 Impact Form</p>\n<p>In these unique circumstances and recognising the challenges inherent in a rapid move to remote delivery, we are introducing the Covid-19 Impact Form.</p>\n<p>The Covid-19 Impact Form will enable students to tell us about circumstances that have affected the remote teaching on one or more modules, but where an individual does not require an immediate adjustment to their assessment. The Form could be used to inform the University of issues relating to remote teaching (e.g. access to ebook provision for a particular module). Students do not have to complete this form as we have a strategy for collecting this information from staff, but if students wish to make us aware of disruption on one or more modules, this is the process to use.</p>\n<p>Deferral of assessment</p>\n<p>We understand that a number of students may be considering an opportunity to defer their assessments until the situation regarding Covid-19 has improved. A decision to defer is therefore one with significant potential consequences and students are advised to consider carefully the implications before applying for a deferral, and to discuss any such decision with academic tutors, the Careers Service, family and friends.</p>\n<p>Given the unprecedented nature of the current situation, we are allowing taught students who wish to defer all their remaining assessments until the August assessment period, to do so without the need to provide supporting evidence.</p>\n<p>Whilst the University recognises that there will be students whose circumstances will require them to defer, at this time the University would encourage students to sit assessments in the summer period as anticipated, knowing that if needed, a resit opportunity is available within the current academic year.</p>\n<p>It must be noted that for students who choose to defer assessments, this would mean the following:</p>\n<p>All assessments which take place in the August assessment period will be delivered and taken remotely and using similar formats as in the summer examination period (there will be no face to face assessments).</p>\n<p>There will be no additional tuition for students if they elect to defer their assessments, moreover students are likely to find staff availability more limited at this time of the year.</p>\n<p>Students who defer their first attempt at assessment to the August assessment period who fail their assessments at this time, will be unlikely to be able to graduate /progress as expected but may be required to resit in the next normal assessment period, which will be in the next academic year.</p>\n<p>Students who plan to enter subsequent academic programmes upon graduation or who have secured places on graduate training programmes due to start in Sept/Oct 2020, may not be able to do so.</p>\n<p>Extension to the August assessment period</p>\n<p>The current emergency situation requires some change to the planned schedule of the academic year in order to accommodate these changes. The summer assessment period will remain as is (Monday 18 May – Friday 5 June) but the August assessment period will be extended by one week to run from Monday 17 August to Friday 4 September 2020.</p>\n<p>Next steps</p>\n<p>University staff are now engaged in developing and implementing this new approach to assessment and mitigation and, as I am sure you will appreciate, there is a lot of detail to work through. We will circulate more information to students on 14 April 2020, which will include online resources to support students in studying and completing assessment in the new remote model.</p>\n<p>We would be most grateful if you would not contact your school or module leaders about these mitigation arrangements prior to 14 April whilst we work out the details. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>\n<p>More information</p>\n<p>I hope that the introduction of the Safety Net and the associated package of support measures will reassure you that we are doing everything we can to support you at this challenging time, and help mitigate the impact of the current situation on your academic performance.</p>\n<p>Detailed information about the Safety Net, how it is calculated, and when it will be available to students is available online at Frequently Asked Questions.</p>\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n<p>Suzanne</p>","id":"694f5b50-1b83-5c67-8681-9247bf9c34f4","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-ncl/2020-04-10-14_08_25/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Message from Prof Suzanne Cholerton"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>As we continue to navigate these unprecedented times together, I would like update you further on our research and knowledge exchange activity.</p>\n<p>This follows the introduction by the UK Government of the most significant restrictions our country has witnessed in order to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Prioritising essential research</p>\n<p>In line with UK Government advice we have moved towards remote teaching, working and examination in order to protect our staff and students.

Over recent weeks we have been working through the various mitigations and regulatory changes required to ensure that no student is academically disadvantaged due to the coronavirus pandemic, while at the same time ensuring the integrity of University of Nottingham degrees. </p>\n<p>You are receiving this email as you are affected by the new exceptional regulations we have put in place in response to the coronavirus pandemic as: an undergraduate finalist; an undergraduate student progressing to their next year of study; an integrated masters student or as a taught postgraduate student. </p>\n<p>No academic disadvantage </p>\n<p>Further to communications sent out to students last week, we want to clarify what is meant by ‘no academic disadvantage’. The 'no academic disadvantage' approach we are developing will impact students at different levels in different ways. However, it will apply to all taught students at all levels across their programmes and for all assessments impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, unless a Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Body requires us to do otherwise. </p>\n<p>The University is moving assessment online for the summer period. Your final or year-end marks will not be negatively affected by your remaining assessment, provided you pass your end-of-year assessments. </p>\n<p>If you are a final-year student graduating this year, and you pass your remaining modules, your degree classification will be awarded either on the basis of your work to date, or improved if you perform well in your final assessments. This also applies to taught postgraduate students on a one-year programme and students on an integrated masters degree. </p>\n<p>If you are a student progressing to your next year of study in September, we have introduced special arrangements to ensure no academic disadvantage if you pass your remaining modules – both for your progression to your next year, and for your final classification. These will continue throughout your studies to ensure that your overall marks will not be negatively affected by online teaching and assessment. </p>\n<p>Methods of assessment </p>\n<p>How students are assessed at the end of the summer term will depend on their field of study, and methods of assessment vary from module to module. We are currently working through how the new exceptional regulations will impact these different forms of assessment for all students. This is a complex process which requires careful checking. </p>\n<p>We realise that waiting for confirmation on how you will be assessed may be stressful, but we need to ensure that our processes for determining assessment and final-year marks are robust, so that we do not disadvantage any student over the course of their degree. </p>\n<p>Your School will be in contact with you with more detail about your individual assessment requirements following the Easter break. This runs from Thursday 9 to Wednesday 15 April. </p>\n<p>Our coronavirus webpages have links to useful resources that you can access over the Easter break, including study support, accommodation, access to online learning tools and advice and resources on maintaining good health and mental wellbeing at this anxious time. </p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding at this challenging time.

This is quite a long message, as there is lots of information to share with you. Please do take the time to read it carefully. </p>\n<p>Before I go into the details, I would like to thank you once again for your patience over the last few weeks. I fully understand that exam periods are stressful at any time, and that the coronavirus pandemic has added considerable extra uncertainty.  I am pleased to be now able to provide you with an outline of the arrangements for the coming term. Departments and Faculties will then provide more detailed information later this week.  </p>\n<p>Responding to student feedback\nRearranging examinations at such short notice is extremely complex and it is important that we get it right. I am particularly grateful to the Oxford SU sabbatical officers who have engaged so constructively in discussions, to the many students who took part in the Oxford SU consultation, and to all of you who have taken the time to write to me. I am confident that we have addressed many of the concerns that were raised – for example, providing flexibility to account for differing needs, and feeding student feedback into our chosen modes of delivery. That is not to say that we will be able to meet everyone’s specific requests. For example, some students have expressed a desire for all assessments to be cancelled, while others have indicated that they would like them all to continue. Clearly, we cannot suit everyone’s preferences in this situation. However, I would like to reassure you that your feedback has been instrumental in shaping our way forward.  </p>\n<p>About our approach<br>\nUltimately, we firmly believe that assessment should continue, albeit in an adapted form. The approach that we have developed is underpinned by the following principles: </p>\n<p>Support for students\nWe are taking steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on academic performance as much as we can, and to take account of your individual circumstances, and particularly your mental and physical health needs.   </p>\n<p>Providing a workable solution\nWe have also worked towards a solution that is as simple and uniform as it can be – to reduce complexity, minimise disruption, and provide an equitable approach for all candidates. There may be some local variations, where there is a clear need.  </p>\n<p>Focus on completion\nWe are also working to ensure as many students as possible can complete their degrees and graduate on time. This will not only mean that you are able to move on to the next stages of your lives and careers, but also allows the University to prepare to offer the best possible education to our new and continuing students in the next academic year </p>\n<p>Outline of arrangements<br>\nWith the above in mind, the approach that has been agreed by the University’s Silver Crisis Response Group, chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, is as follows:  </p>\n<p>First-year undergraduates\nThe majority of assessments for first-year undergraduates will be cancelled, and students will be deemed to have passed. Instead of formal exams, you will be supported to consolidate your first-year learning in other ways, including informal assessments to give you feedback on your progress to date.</p>\n<p>The only exceptions are Law and Medicine, where assessments are required for professional qualification reasons.  Details for these subjects will follow in the near future.  </p>\n<p>Where the first-year assessment includes coursework elements (such as completion of laboratory classes), these will normally be assessed on the basis of completion to the end of Hilary Term. Your department or faculty will confirm the details. </p>\n<p>Second and third-year (non-finalist) undergraduates, and first-year MPhil:\nMost exams will be deferred into the next academic year, though a small number will be cancelled outright.  </p>\n<p>The exceptions are those third-year undergraduate exams which need to go ahead because they are taken by a mix of continuing and leaving students. Your department or faculty will confirm shortly.\nFurther details about postponed assessments, and how the next academic year will be adjusted to accommodate them, will be decided as soon as possible. </p>\n<p>Final-year undergraduates and taught postgraduates:\nExams will be replaced with alternative forms of assessment in Trinity term 2020. These will take the form of either open-book versions of the standard papers, longer pieces of work completed over several days, or a mix of the two (except Fine Art, and Music performance papers, for which separate arrangements will be put in place).<br>\nFurther details are as follows: </p>\n<p>Open-book exams will be required in many cases. Departments and Faculties have carefully considered the merits of this type of exam, as well as longer pieces of assessed work for their subject matter, taking student opinion into account.  </p>\n<p>Open-book exams will be of slightly longer duration (e.g. a three-hour paper will be extended to four hours, with comparable timings for other paper lengths). Further adjustments will be made for those with approved alternative exam arrangements such as extra writing time.  Exams will be taken within a 24-hour window to account for different time zones.   </p>\n<p>We will make an effort to reduce the number of assessments. And, in a few instances where a large fraction of the award has already been assessed, the remaining exams will be cancelled. </p>\n<p>We plan to implement a safety net policy, which will aim to minimise the risk that Trinity term assessments harm students’ outcomes, compared to their performance in earlier formal assessments. Because of Oxford’s very diverse assessment landscape, the details of this are still being finalised and will be communicated as soon as possible. </p>\n<p>We will put in measures as a priority to support students who are concerned about access to necessary workspaces, technology and resources.  Your college will contact you about this soon. </p>\n<p>Steps will be taken to address plagiarism and collusion, including the implementation of an ‘honour code’ and the use of specialist software.   </p>\n<p>While the exam timetable will need adjustment, most assessments will take place at similar times to a normal year. However, most exams in Weeks 0 and 1 will be rearranged to help staff and students prepare.  </p>\n<p>It will not be possible to postpone exams for final-year undergraduates and taught postgraduates until Michaelmas 2020. The only exception is for exams which are required to be sat in an invigilated setting by external accreditation bodies.  </p>\n<p>Alternative options for finalists\nIf you are unable to complete the alternative forms of assessment due to illness or personal circumstances, you will have two options available to you:  </p>\n<p>Opt to graduate with a “Declared to Deserve Honours” status.  </p>\n<p>This is a special class of degree (with an equivalent for PGT students), which we are introducing this year as a response to the pandemic. While the formal award will be unclassified, it will be accompanied by an enhanced reference indicating the class of degree the student was expected to achieve. We are working with employers and other universities to make clear that this is a recognition of the extraordinary circumstances which make completion of assessments impossible for some candidates. Students will be able to apply for this outcome by completing an application form at least two days before their first exam. No special supporting paperwork will be required. </p>\n<p>Return to Oxford to sit written exams in Trinity term 2021.<br>\nThis option would require college support on the basis of your particular circumstances, as in a normal year.  If granted permission, you would only be able to return to take examinations.  </p>\n<p>Projects and dissertations<br>\nProjects and dissertations will largely proceed as planned for both undergraduates and taught postgraduates. However, deadlines will be extended to account for the disruption that the pandemic has caused, and factors such as missed lab work, cancelled fieldwork, and reduced archive access will be fully taken into account by the examiners. </p>\n<p>Teaching and learning (for all students)\nAs per previous announcements, all teaching and learning will be carried out remotely, and we are doing everything we can to ensure we maintain Oxford’s excellent standards of education, albeit in digital form. All students will be expected to complete the academic year, regardless of the format of delivery.  </p>\n<p>Detailed arrangements and further information<br>\nYour departments will write to you by no later than Friday 3 April to confirm the specific arrangements for your course, and will be working through all the details with you thereafter.  </p>\n<p>There are particular difficulties around assessment of Fine Art and Music that mean the faculties concerned may not be able to give you complete certainty over your assessment by the end of this week. Students in those subjects will be kept informed of developments by their faculties. </p>\n<p>We have now published a large number of FAQs in the examinations and assessments section of the student coronavirus advice page on the Oxford Students website, as well as an introduction to open book-exams. We will be publishing much more guidance and support over the coming days and weeks, so please continue to check the website, and read the Student News to stay updated.  </p>\n<p>If you have any urgent questions about your assessments after reading all the information we have already provided, you should contact your department or faculty in the first instance. However, I would encourage you to wait to receive more detailed information about your specific course first, wherever possible.  </p>\n<p>Support for you\nAcademic and professional staff across the University will be doing everything we can to support you in the weeks and months ahead. and the usual welfare support will still be available to you (albeit in a remote form).  </p>\n<p>We are fully aware of concerns over the possible impact of working in a home that is not conducive to academic study. Colleges will be contacting students in the near future to gain a better understanding of students’ circumstances, and we will take steps to support you.  </p>\n<p>We know that it is likely that some students will fall ill over the coming period, and some students will be trying to study whilst dealing with difficult family circumstances. We will work hard to support you and deal with these circumstances and others flexibly and sensitively.   </p>\n<p>We also understand that all students have been impacted by the effects of the coronavirus, some very severely. This will of course be fully taken into account in assessment and classification. Our examiners are very experienced in making adjustments of this sort, and will do so sympathetically and with great care. </p>\n<p>I wish you every success with your studies at this extraordinary time.  </p>\n<p>Martin Williams<br>\nPro-Vice-Chancellor</p>","id":"874935ca-95c3-5ec7-aa66-5f08b45ef8c3","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-ox/2020-04-09-14_21_13/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Message from the Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Education: Trinity term examination arrangements"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>I am writing to provide another update about the University’s response to coronavirus, with some more detailed information about our planning for Trinity term.

Our aim throughout our planning is to ensure students can continue, or complete, their academic careers at Oxford, and to allow them to be assessed fairly, regardless of their backgrounds or individual circumstances.  With this in mind our current proposals are as follows:</p>\n<p>Teaching and learning\nThe University has a wide range of tools available for academics to deliver lectures, tutorials and supervisions online. Academics and administrative staff have been given a range of advice to help record lectures, carry out real time, face-to face meetings with students, and guidance on moving towards online models.

With this in mind our current proposals are as follows:\nTeaching and learning\nThe University has a wide range of tools available for academics to deliver lectures, tutorials and supervisions online.

The same may apply to some other types of project, such as those that require access to materials that are only available in hard-copy archives. We recognise that some students may already have started a project that cannot now be completed, and that the scope will need to be dramatically altered.\nIf this change affects you, you should consult the course director in your department or faculty to agree an alternative project that can be completed from your desk (such as literature reviews, data analysis or computer modelling).

As per my previous email, you are encouraged to work from home, or from your University/college accommodation wherever possible. We recognise that many research students regard Oxford as their home and you should feel welcome to stay here. Your health, both physical and mental, should be your number one priority, and your supervisors should make whatever adjustments are necessary to ensure you can remain safe during the public health emergency.</p>\n<p>Keeping in contact with your supervisor\nSupervisors are being encouraged to work with students to ensure that where possible, there are ways to keep research moving forward. This may include restructuring the project so that you can work remotely. This will not be possible in all cases – many of you will be doing heavily experimental projects – we understand that, but where it is possible to make adjustments, even if this can only be to a limited extent or for a short period, you should aim to do so.</p>\n<p>Deadlines will be extended and no student will lapse as a result of coronavirus<br>\nIf you have any upcoming deadlines – transfer, confirmation or submission – the disruption caused by coronavirus will be taken into account and your deadlines will be extended wherever necessary. Further details will follow about the process for this, but in the meantime you will remain a student of the University, even past deadlines. I would like to reassure you that no student’s status will lapse as a result of missing deadlines owing to coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Keep a log of anything coronavirus-related that has an impact on your research\nTo help us to ensure that any adjustments are made to deadlines and your student record, it will be helpful if you and your supervisor can keep track of any situation which may impede your ability to continue with your studies. Further detail about how this should be logged will follow from divisional offices, but I would encourage you to start considering this now</p>\n<p>Travel for international students<br>\nFinally, as per my previous note, International and EU students should make decisions about whether to return home based on their individual circumstances.  If you cannot get home, or you feel you need to stay in Oxford, you may do so and we will support you staying in Oxford.

It will take a while for us all to adapt to such strange times, but I’m sure those of you in the UK will have been as proud as I was to see the handclapping tribute to NHS and careworkers across the country on Thursday evening.</p>\n<p>At Warwick, a huge amount of effort has gone into our four key priorities over the last week and I wanted to update you, and thank you for your patience and support.</p>\n<p>The welfare of our community continues to be our very highest priority. The students who remain on campus are being looked after – the residential life team also remains on campus, wellbeing support services continue and Rootes grocery store remains open. We are in regular contact with our student community spread around the world to offer support and provide updates.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of our staff are working from home – connecting remotely (sometimes more successfully than others!), and a small number of individuals continue to work on campus to support remaining students, maintain key research facilities and provide wellbeing, security, access and health and safety services. We have a lot of advice and guidance for colleagues online to help you continue to work, understand your rights and our responsibilities and get support. I’m so very grateful to everyone for coming together at this time. More wellbeing support and advice will be provided virtually as soon as we can.</p>\n<p>In line with our commitment to graduate our students, work continues to shift our assessment model to a virtual one. Thank you to students for your patience as we bring plans together, I know you are worried about what the alternatives to exams will look like, and hope the regular teaching and learning newsletters are helpful.</p>\n<p>Since calling on you to play your part in the community however you could – you have been sharing what you’ve been doing - thank you. It’s amazing – people are running prescription pick-up services, sending out checking-in notes to neighbours, sharing meals and volunteering at local food banks. I’m humbled. Keep the ideas coming!</p>\n<p>We’re doing our bit as a University too – giving PPE to the NHS, making hand sanitiser, contributing lab space for Covid-19 work, scientific advice to government, WMS staff and students actively working with the NHS. I’m sure, and indeed I hope, there is much more to come. I’m so pleased to see what we can do by working together with our region. I think the grins on the faces of Seb Perrier and his chemistry team showing the sanitiser they’ve made says it all.</p>\n<p>So: stay safe, enjoy the Spring sunshine if you’re still in the UK and keep in touch.\"</p>","id":"0c82043a-7f80-5d6c-ac73-1048c1e6d59b","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-warkwick.ac/2020-04-08-23_43_17/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Community update from Vice-Chancellor Stuart Croft"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://d36jn9qou1tztq.cloudfront.net/static_war/render/id7/images/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png\"></p>\n<p>Dear colleagues,</p>\n<p>As the health and wellbeing of our students and colleagues remains our top priority, we continue to review all of our work at Warwick in relation to Covid 19. As of today – Monday 16 March 2020, we wish to make staff aware of the following key advice and decisions we have made in addition to Public Health England (PHE) and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice as we ready ourselves for more significant impact.</p>\n<p>The Prime Minister has this afternoon asked everyone, where possible and practical, to work from home. Heads of Department will now work with colleagues to implement the Prime Minister’s request with immediate effect. We had, of course, already started work to support staff to prepare for working from home. All buildings will be open as normal from tomorrow and you should discuss planned working arrangements with your line manager. There will be no overseas travel on University business. The University will remain open, but there will be no face to face teaching or assessments. Academic departments will be in touch with students via local routes to advise on changes and we are providing extensive support for academic departments to be able to move swiftly to online teaching and assessment. We are providing wellbeing support and advice via the Employee Assistance Programme.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above points, students have also been advised:</p>\n<p>Students who cannot go home will be able to use campus accommodation if required. The Library and study spaces remain open for the time being. We are providing student support and advice to students via Wellbeing Support Services.</p>\n<p>I know that many of you have been running at pace to help support our students and wider community in response to Covid-19. These are unprecedented times and I’m grateful to everyone for your commitment and calm.</p>\n<p>I want to thank everyone who is pulling together to make this work at incredibly short notice, and I wish to particularly thank those staff colleagues who will need to be on campus to keep some services operating. This is particularly important as a number of our students will still be living on campus and we will need to support them and provide essential services. I know that HoDs in such areas will be talking to colleagues to see how best we can sustain these services while meeting the Prime Minister’s request.</p>\n<p>Obviously there are more details yet to be worked out (and we will provide these to you as soon as we can) and we are having to send this update outside normal office hours when many may not see it quickly, but I wanted you have our response to the Prime Minister’s request as soon as possible. In this period, please do take care of yourselves, your families and our community. Please continue to wash your hands thoroughly and regularly. Practice social distancing. If in doubt, self-isolate. And please continue to pay close attention to further updates that we will send to you by email, supported by regularly updated FAQs online.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Stuart</p>\n<p>Professor Stuart Croft, Vice-Chancellor.</p>","id":"feaf4d0e-1bc3-5347-89f8-c0bd676e2532","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-warkwick.ac/2020-04-08-23_43_22/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vice-Chancellor's message to staff 16th March 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://d36jn9qou1tztq.cloudfront.net/static_war/render/id7/images/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png\"></p>\n<p>As part of our priority to safeguard health during the global coronavirus outbreak, the University has decided to postpone the July 2020 Degree Ceremonies.</p>\n<p>Students whose degree ceremonies are affected have received an email from Stuart Croft, Vice-Chancellor, on 2 April, letting them know.</p>\n<p>Students will still graduate</p>\n<p>All those students meeting the requirements of their award will still graduate in July 2020 as usual, but this will be in absentia (in their absence) rather than at an event.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we will post out degree certificates and, for undergraduates, update Higher Education Achievement Reports.

This is a 24/7 online peer and professional support service with trained counsellors. Big White Wall provides a safe space to share your thoughts and feelings. While on the site, you are totally anonymous to other members in the community.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we have created a new web page all about looking after your wellbeing during the pandemic. It brings together and outlines the support available from the University, the Students’ Unions and has links to useful external advice.</p>\n<p>These two new services complement existing University services, such as:</p>\n<p>the Student Hub and Colleges who are happy to arrange telephone or email appointments to discuss anything that is worrying you - from advice on your private rental contract, to problems with your flatmate or reporting self-isolation.</p>\n<p>the Open Door team continues to offer appointments. If you are new to Open Door, simply complete the online referral form and they will get in touch with you via email or telephone.</p>\n<p>the Writing and Language Skills Centre, and the Math Skills Centre continue to support you improving your academic and language skills</p>\n<p>The Students’ Unions are also working hard to help students during this time. YUSU and GSA have launched a range of online wellbeing initiatives. 'Keep Home and Carry On' from the GSA includes a calendar of online activities such as: fitness schedules, music playlists, family activities, online coffee meet-ups, book recommendations and even online karaoke. And, there is a YUSU Covid 19 Community Facebook page, for students to link up and swap tips, events, activities and ideas for dealing with the challenges we are all facing. In addition, the YUSU Advice &#x26; Support Centre (ASC) and the GSA Advice Service are available via email.</p>\n<p>As we move to more online working it is important to remember that we are a global community of equality, inclusion and respect. If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour we encourage you to report it to the University.</p>\n<p>Finally, I want to reassure you that we are listening to your feedback and working to improve our support and online services. The pandemic is making life difficult for all, so please stay safe and well.

We will be able to update with more details nearer the time.</p>\n<p>Keep talking to each other and we will continue to work hard to give you clarity in these times of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Remember to keep checking your emails and the Covid-19 pages for updates.</p>\n<p>Please take care, keep safe and we will be back in touch next week.</p>\n<p>Kind regards</p>\n<p>Charlie</p>\n<p>Professor Charlie Jeffery</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor</p>","id":"62fa5aa9-d6fe-5d07-9786-bc4c19001715","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-york/2020-04-08-23_25_24/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) updates"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7SFGerL1e8_nNxORbP09lqQKO3XfKs_ZGtlynsgKlkeRulD3ck1QvA1B5Ziz36qnTAnxWYwpUxAJ68Lu6xrye4B_Q2yQVnAt\"></p>\n<p>All student email</p>\n<p>Covid-19 update Tuesday 24 March - health and wellbeing, accommodation, support fund and online teaching</p>\n<p>Dear students</p>\n<p>Thank you for your continued patience as we work through the details of our response to the Covid-19 crisis. And thank you too for the understanding you have already shown for the changes we are having to make.</p>\n<p>Last night, the UK Government gave clear advice about how we can all help to respond to the crisis. This includes: a clear instruction to stay at home except for a number of tightly specified activities, including essential basic shopping for food and medical supplies, adhering to social distancing rules, and banning all social gatherings of more than 2 people.</p>\n<p>I appreciate many of you will have questions and concerns, both about these new measures, but also about how we are moving to online teaching and assessment for the summer term. I address some of these issues below, and you should continue to visit our Covid-19 webpages for further information. I also have updates below about our ongoing support for our now dispersed community of students, and rent instalments for the summer term.</p>\n<p>Keeping safe</p>\n<p>We are proud that York students are such an important part of our compassionate, caring community. I encourage you all to continue to support your family and friends during this difficult time. The latest UK Government advice makes it very clear what we need to do.</p>\n<p>The new measures include:</p>\n<p>Staying at home except for essential trips to shops for basic food items, health reasons, for essential work, or if you are getting supplies to support an older or vulnerable person;</p>\n<p>Staying 2 metres (6ft) away from other people;</p>\n<p>Washing your hands as soon as you get home;</p>\n<p>Advising any British citizens who remain abroad to return to the UK as quickly as possible as airports around the world begin to close down.</p>\n<p>This staying at home message makes it even more important that we find new ways of talking, listening to, and supporting one another. I will be back in touch in the next few days with some further ideas about how we can all stay in touch and give that support, working with both YUSU and GSA.</p>\n<p>Accommodation and summer term</p>\n<p>Our campus accommodation remains open for our students. The college teams will continue to support our residents during these exceptional times. As I wrote to you last week this is a rapidly changing situation - we have already encouraged those of you who can return to their homes to do so. Many of you have chosen to do this already and after last night’s advice from the Government, more of you may wish to consider this option. In light of that we have listened carefully to your concerns about rental agreements and I can now confirm that if you notify the University you wish to cancel your accommodation contract, there will be no charge made from the start of the summer term - Tuesday 14 April.</p>\n<p>We will be contacting those with rental agreements with the University with more detailed guidance, including how to notify accommodation teams, financial processes and check out arrangements. This offer of early contract cancellation also applies to students in Student Castle who booked directly through Accommodation Services.</p>\n<p>The Student Hub and College teams are also available to provide emotional and wellbeing support and advice for those students remaining on campus or who have accommodation contracts with private providers.</p>\n<p>Emergency Student Support Fund (COVID-19)</p>\n<p>Through donations from alumni, friends, and supporters of the York Unlimited philanthropic campaign, I am delighted to announce that we are launching the Emergency Student Support Fund. This will provide financial support of up to £500 (per applicant) for students facing unanticipated financial challenges.</p>\n<p>Applications will open to students at 5pm Wednesday 25 March 2020 and will close 5pm Wednesday 1 April 2020 (with further dates to be announced). Details of how to apply will soon be available on <a href=\"https://coronavirus.york.ac.uk\">https://coronavirus.york.ac.uk</a>.</p>\n<p>All current students who are fully-registered at the University of York on a degree-awarding (UG/PG/FT and PT) programme are eligible to apply for the Emergency Student Support Fund. Please note that prioritisation will be made on the basis of the student’s individual needs.</p>\n<p>I know some of you have also been asking about student loans. The UK Government has assured us that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is planning to make Term 3 tuition fee payments as scheduled and that students will continue to receive maintenance payments on the scheduled dates.</p>\n<p>Online teaching and assessment</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, preparing to move over 18,000 students to a method of online teaching and assessment that will suit their discipline and stage of progression is a huge undertaking. Our aim is to continue to support you in your studies, and help you to progress to the next phase of your programme.</p>\n<p>We have been working closely with departments to agree which online platforms will be most suitable to deliver teaching. This also includes the types of alternative assessments that we will need to use to replace closed exams in exam halls, laboratory work, group assignments, and performances.</p>\n<p>We are thinking through the different scenarios, assessing the options and testing the technical details. We will be in a position to tell you more very soon, to give you a clearer picture of how your studies will resume at the start of the summer term. We are aiming to provide additional information for students this week, and further updates on areas where we are still working through the details by the end of next week.</p>\n<p>Supporting our Students</p>\n<p>The health and wellbeing of our students remains an absolute priority. We appreciate this is a worrying and stressful time. Many of you have written to tell us how the uncertainty caused by Covid-19 is affecting your studies and your health. We are listening and our student-facing teams are in a position to provide online assistance to support you.</p>\n<p>Support teams available to students on and off campus include Open Door, Student Hub, Disability, and Colleges, as well as conduct and respect. You will understand that most of these services now need to be delivered remotely for the safety of staff and students, and in line with the latest Government advice.</p>\n<p>We know that students with disabilities have particular concerns and we encourage those with a support plan in place who are concerned about assessments to contact the Disability Team.</p>\n<p>More broadly, our academic and college staff, and our colleagues behind the scenes keeping our digital systems up and running, and our accommodation open for those who need it, are making every possible effort to support you on campus or remotely. They are doing an extraordinary job, and I thank them for all their work in these difficult circumstances. However, as the situation evolves, in these unprecedented times, we may need to make changes to the services we can offer or we may need you to do things differently. We will let you know if anything changes.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, please continue to contact the Student Hub if you have particular concerns. Our overnight Security team is also available on campus to provide additional support.</p>\n<p>The most important thing is to keep yourselves healthy and safe. It is absolutely vital that you follow the guidance provided by the Government and health services of the country where you reside. In the UK, we ask that you keep referring to the latest Government advice and staying at home guidance. If you are self-isolating on campus and you have any queries or concerns please contact the Student Hub.</p>\n<p>I will be in contact again in the coming days with further information, but in the meantime, keep checking your emails and the Covid19 webpages for new guidance and updates.</p>\n<p>With warm wishes</p>\n<p>Charlie</p>\n<p>Professor Charlie Jeffery</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor and President</p>","id":"e2a31b5b-e650-59a5-b9d2-b0af63c4457f","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-york/2020-04-08-23_25_28/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tuesday 24 March: Student emails"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Emo8DO5_IJZ-gu5TWYOkh_rQsoeLR9nfukdvoITThVnpx7Rr1x-ZU97u0zgrw18i_to_uLrvxeOSBXHDLRVsl4qKGT4qq-7b\"></p>\n<p>Email to all staff</p>\n<p>Covid-19 update Wednesday 25 March</p>\n<p>Dear colleague,</p>\n<p>As we face the unprecedented challenge of Covid-19, I have been truly impressed by how colleagues across the University have moved so quickly and effectively to respond at this incredibly difficult time.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank you, once again, for all the hard work taking place behind the scenes to ensure our staff and students are supported in the face of such uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Research Excellence Framework</p>\n<p>The impact of Covid-19 continues to expand its impact on universities. Much of that has been felt so far in the changes we are making to our teaching. But there are also impacts on our research.</p>\n<p>As you may have seen, Research England has announced that REF2021 is now on hold, delayed until further notice. We are all very aware - and grateful - for the time already spent preparing for our submission.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that the census date arrangements for REF have not changed and we will continue to work with UUK and the Russell Group to understand further the implications of the postponement and the plans for the rescheduled submission. Further information will be shared with relevant staff by the PVC for Research.</p>\n<p>Communicating support for students</p>\n<p>I also wanted to provide you with an update about some work we have been doing to look after our students, including some announcements of significant offers of support.</p>\n<p>First, and with enormous thanks to our very many generous alumni, staff, friends, and supporters of the York Unlimited philanthropic campaign, we have launched the Emergency Student Support Fund (COVID-19).</p>\n<p>This fund has been established to provide financial support to students with housing and food costs, travel expenses, technology costs associated with online learning and other unanticipated financial challenges. It provides support of up to £500 per student and details of how to apply will be widely publicised.</p>\n<p>Second, we confirmed that there will be no charge made from the start of the summer term for students with rental agreements with the University. This offer of early contract cancellation also includes students in Student Castle who booked directly through Accommodation Services.</p>\n<p>We have already encouraged as many students as possible to return to their homes, but for some this is not possible and our campus will therefore remain home to some students. We have reiterated to students that the Student Hub and College teams are available to support those remaining on campus, students who have accommodation contracts with private providers in York, or students with other particular requirements.</p>\n<p>Engaging our Prospective Students</p>\n<p>You will doubtless have seen many media reports on the potential impacts that the cancellation of public examinations may have on this year’s domestic admissions process. We are pleased that the Government has now confirmed that students taking A-Level and other final examinations will be able to progress to University this year. We have received very strong guidance from the Department of Education, OfS and UCAS that we must not try to amend existing offers, for example by making them unconditional offers. Our approach is different: to develop a range of ways to engage with our prospective students in a supportive way over the coming months. I shared a message to offer holders about how we will develop this support. You can see my video message to offer holders here.</p>\n<p>Building Closures</p>\n<p>Finally, you will have seen a message from the University Registrar &#x26; Secretary setting out guidance for the closure of most buildings on campus in order to protect frontline essential services: supporting students resident on campus, critical research (especially where it can help tackle the Covid-19 crisis) and essential maintenance. I urge you all to take seriously the need for the vast majority of staff to remain in their homes as per the Government instructions. This is above all to limit the potential for spread of the virus - and to protect our essential staff from that risk as they carry out their tasks. Thank you once again to those small number of colleagues who are remaining on campus to provide those essential services.</p>\n<p>I hope you are managing to stay well and that the additional constraints on remaining at home has not proved too difficult. Please look after yourselves and your families, especially now that many of you are balancing home-working and childcare.</p>\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n<p>Charlie</p>\n<p>Professor Charlie Jeffery</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor</p>","id":"e89f5795-58d4-5397-90db-35ec6a128289","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-york/2020-04-08-23_25_31/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Wednesday 25 March: Staff and postgraduate research student email"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Emo8DO5_IJZ-gu5TWYOkh_rQsoeLR9nfukdvoITThVnpx7Rr1x-ZU97u0zgrw18i_to_uLrvxeOSBXHDLRVsl4qKGT4qq-7b\"></p>\n<p>All student email</p>\n<p>Important information: Update on assessment, teaching and learning 26 March 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Student</p>\n<p>I hope that you are keeping well in these unprecedented and worrying times. The current Covid-19 crisis has meant the world looks very different for all of us, and we are committed to supporting you to keep healthy and safe, and to study and progress to the best of your abilities.</p>\n<p>Periods of assessment are stressful at the best of times and the current circumstances add to that. We have carefully considered all online assessment and teaching options in light of this and can now provide you with some more information on how these will take place. This information will be complemented by further details from your Departments.</p>\n<p>Before I set out details, I want to acknowledge the range of feelings on the issue of assessments. I have heard from students who would like all assessments cancelled for the rest of the academic year and from some who would like all to continue. I understand the strength of feeling and we have considered all your concerns very carefully.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we believe that assessment for everyone except undergraduate first years should continue, albeit in adapted form. This is to maintain the integrity of your qualification. However, we are also clear that assessment should fairly reflect the unprecedented circumstances we are all facing and we have put a range of measures in place to ensure this is the case.</p>\n<p>In short, we will do everything we can to support you to complete this academic year successfully. We know that it is likely that some students will fall ill over the coming period, and some students will be trying to study whilst dealing with difficult family circumstances and we will work hard to support you and deal with these circumstances and others flexibly and sensitively.</p>\n<p>This email gives an overview of options and changes with more detail provided on the COVID-19 learning, teaching, assessment and progression webpage.</p>\n<p>You will also receive more detailed information specific to your studies from your department. There are special arrangements for International Pathway College students and the IPC will communicate with IPC students directly about these.</p>\n<p>New ways of working</p>\n<p>All teaching and learning resources will move online</p>\n<p>All examinations will move online, with the exception of all undergraduate first year assessments which have been cancelled</p>\n<p>Teaching and studying online</p>\n<p>Most provision of online teaching and learning for the rest of the academic year involves online materials, online lectures and online discussions. General information on all three is summarised here. Your department will be in touch about the specifics for your courses.</p>\n<p>Online materials: Lecture recordings, reading resources and further study materials will be made available within your VLE module site. Although you do not currently have access to the Library's collection of printed books and other physical resources, you continue to have access to our full range of electronic resources (including ebooks and ejournals).</p>\n<p>Please contact your Academic Liaison Librarian with details of any specific resources which you are struggling to access and we will investigate what electronic options are available. You can find their details on our Subject Guides. You are also welcome to request ebooks not already held in the Library's collections.</p>\n<p>Online lectures: Most remaining lectures will be recorded and put online for you to download and view at a time that suits you and your current circumstances. We feel this is the best solution for our students who may be trying to keep up with learning in different time zones. You may also find that online lectures will be broken up into smaller ‘chunks’ than you are used to in a physical lecture theatre setting.</p>\n<p>Your lecturers can no longer travel to campus under the new Government guidance which means in most cases they will be recording content from their desks at home, so you may see and hear some unusual background noises or be treated to glimpses of passing children, other family members or pets. We are all having to adapt to new ways of working in the current situation so please bear with us.</p>\n<p>Online discussions: We know how much our students value and learn from engaging with the ideas of their classmates and through contributing to discussion. Normally, seminars provide the mechanism for this. Now your classmates may be spread around the globe in different time zones. Many students will have caring responsibilities or periods of illness that mean they need to engage at different times. For these reasons, lecturers may instead set up discussion boards on the VLE and to set seminar subjects regularly. They will keep in touch with you to discuss whether students may be able to engage with them in ‘real time’. There may be times when your lecturers are not able to actively participate, for example if they themselves are unwell or are caring for unwell family members.</p>\n<p>We are also encouraging student groups to self-organise and to set up their own chat groups and virtual spaces where they can exchange ideas and talk about the course materials. We have put together a learning online resource for students that gives you guidance on the digital tools you can use.</p>\n<p>Changes to assessments</p>\n<p>We understand that moving to online assessment may cause you concerns and it may not always be possible to replace all assessment with an online activity. We are working with academic departments to decide the best way to run, at a distance, each remaining assessment between now and the end of the academic year.</p>\n<p>For most students we expect assessments will change in one of the following ways:</p>\n<p>A coursework alternative where some exams will be replaced by an open assessment with at least one month allowed between students receiving the assessment specification and the submission date.</p>\n<p>where some exams will be replaced by an open assessment with at least one month allowed between students receiving the assessment specification and the submission date. An open exam alternative where the exam is replaced with an online exam. Mostly these will have a duration of 24 hours although in some cases the timing will be different or there are other special arrangements. We will base our new on-line exam timetable as closely as possible on the currently advertised timetable. In some cases changes will be made to ensure that we do not overload students or the online system. The day-long time-slot also recognises that students will be undertaking the exam in a variety of locations and settings.</p>\n<p>where the exam is replaced with an online exam.

In a limited number of cases the assessment may be waived</p>\n<p>We are aiming to confirm hand-in dates and times for all coursework assessments as soon as possible and no later than 17 April. In most cases you will be hearing from your department within the next few days. You will have at least a month for coursework and the latest due date for a piece of coursework will be the end of week 6 (22 May). We are working to fit together the open exams into a new exam timetable. This is likely to be released in the week commencing 20 April and will show on your student timetable in the usual way. If you are an International Pathway College (IPC) student you should work to the dates that have been advised to you by the College.</p>\n<p>Changes to supervision</p>\n<p>We will be doing all we can to support you with pastoral and dissertation/research supervision. We recommend that you engage with your supervisors to discuss a platform and way of maintaining contact that suits you both.</p>\n<p>Exceptional circumstances</p>\n<p>We appreciate that many of you will face challenges to engaging with your study and your assessments as a result of Covid-19. We will recognise these as exceptional circumstances and have amended our policy to allow you to self-certify. We do not want you to seek such evidence from health professionals who will be very busy dealing with the most acute cases. You can still apply for exceptional circumstances in the usual way using the existing form.</p>\n<p>Our aim is to support you to complete this academic year successfully. We know that it is likely that some students will fall ill over the coming period, and some students will be trying to study whilst dealing with difficult family circumstances. We will work hard to help and support you flexibly and sensitively, and we will treat requests for extensions sympathetically.</p>\n<p>For more information</p>\n<p>I have only provided a brief overview here. There is more general information on the University response to Covid-19 on the main University Covid-19 webpages and more detail on assessment and teaching on this page. Your department will also provide you with more specific details as they work through your programme of work. For those of you wishing to gain an even deeper understanding of our work in progress here is a link to the Covid-19 Academic Guidance issued to departments last week.

I also explained that we are moving to different methods of online assessment and that we expect assessments will change in one of the following ways:</p>\n<p>A coursework alternative where some exams will be replaced by an open assessment with at least one month between students receiving the assessment specification and the submission date.</p>\n<p>An open exam alternative where the exam is replaced with an online exam that is available for 24 hours.

The safety net is a way of guaranteeing in advance what the lowest your final academic-year average will be, provided you qualify to pass the year.</p>\n<p>The safety net takes into account what you have achieved in work submitted up to the 13 March 2020. We then put a peg in place that says given what we know so far this is the ‘safety net score’. You will get to know what this score is prior to the summer assessments and, provided you qualify to pass the year, your academic-year average will not be lower. This will apply to undergraduate students who are in second year or above at this point including integrated masters students, but not including HYMS MBBS students.</p>\n<p>It is important to understand that this safety net score does not mean you can stop your studies or opt out of summer assessments. The safety net can only be used by students who meet the requirements to progress to the next year or, in final year, to be awarded their degree. This means you still have to pass your modules to progress (by earning a mark of 40 or above or having modules compensated) and, in most cases, that means you still need to complete your summer term assessments. In any case, we expect all students to continue with their studies until the end of the academic year 2019/20.</p>\n<p>Integrated masters students will only have to meet the requirements to progress to the next year of the Bachelor’s degree.</p>\n<p>Some students whose degrees are externally accredited, or overseen by Professional Standards Bodies may not be eligible to use a safety net score because of the nature of their qualification. This won’t be the case for most students but may affect those working to get a degree that gives them a professional title of some kind. We are working with these bodies to determine what they will allow: if you are on one of these programmes, your department will be in touch about what this means for you once we know for sure. These details may take some time to determine. So please be patient if you are in this position-- it’s important to all of us that you can have your degrees accredited.</p>\n<p>Following the summer term assessments we will apply the rules as normal to calculate your average for the year. If your assessment score takes your mark up higher than your safety net score, then this higher score becomes your new overall score. If, however, the results of your summer assessments would take your mark down below your given safety net score, then we will use your safety net score. In short, we will take whichever overall score is the higher- your end of year score or your safety net score.</p>\n<p>Please note: The safety net score does not prevent you from being able to apply for exceptional circumstances. We understand this situation is impacting everyone differently, and that for some students it may not be possible properly to engage with their study or assessment at some points in the coming months. If this is the case for you, please see the information on exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p>Calculation of the safety-net score</p>\n<p>The principle we will apply to the calculation of the safety net is that if you have completed 60 credits “worth” of assessments, or more, prior to 13 March 2020, in the current academic year, then the average mark for these assessments is your safety net. If you do not have 60 credits worth of marks available, we will make up the “missing” credits using your previous year’s mark. In this way, we will always have at least 60 credits of assessments on which to base your safety net score. This is the minimum number of credits that we can use to be sure that we’re accurately reflecting your achievements.</p>\n<p>In more detail, the calculation will be done in the following steps, for each student:</p>\n<p>We will work out the credit value of all the assessments in the 2019/20 academic year with submission dates before 13 March 2020. This will be done for all individual completed assessments, regardless of whether or not there are other assessments for a module that have not been completed. This will take into account both the number of credits for the module and the percentage contribution of each assessment to the module. We will calculate a total, credit-weighted, average of all those assessments in step 1. If the total credit value of the assessments (step 1) is 60 credits or more, then the credit-weighted average of those assessments (step 2) will be the safety net. If this is not the case, then see step 4. If the total credit value of the assessments in the current academic year (step 1) is less than 60 credits, then the missing credits (i.e. to make up 60) will be assigned a score of the year-average for the previous academic year for which there are numerical marks available. The average across the full 60 credits then forms the safety net score.</p>\n<p>For some second-year students, this will mean using an average of their first year marks. We’ll only be using first year marks to fill in the ‘gap’ in available second year marks. We’re doing this because deciding on a whole year’s average based on a tiny amount of assessed work (say, a student who has only done one in-class presentation, or had a series of problem papers that they didn’t take that seriously because they didn’t “count” for much) would mean wildly unpredictable and unfair results.</p>\n<p>Similarly, for some third year students, the ‘gap’ will be filled with their second year average, and for fourth year (integrated masters) students, the ‘gap’ will be filled with their third year average.</p>\n<p>A worked through example can be found on the Covid-19 pages. You can also use this estimator to give you an approximation of your safety score. Please be aware that the score generated is only as accurate as the information you can provide and should be taken as an indication of your likely safety net score, not a certainty.</p>\n<p>We have looked at what other universities have proposed, we have considered what will work best for York and we have endeavoured to develop a well thought through solution that can work for all our undergraduate students. We are determined to focus on an approach that means that none of our students are disadvantaged by circumstances beyond their control, and everyone is rewarded for the hard work and achievements made throughout the full length of their studies. At the same time we want to maintain an appropriate and approved level of academic integrity to ensure the validity and value of the degree or award achieved. There is a delicate balance to be maintained.</p>\n<p>I understand that the concept of the safety net is quite complex and I hope I have explained this in a way that reassures you we are doing our very best to balance allowing you to show what you are capable of, and protecting the long-term value of your degree classification. If you have any questions or are unsure how this might affect you please contact your department in the first instance. But please understand that as things are moving fast, departments too are just beginning to consider what this means, so replies may take a little while for individual students.</p>\n<p>The Students’ Union is also working hard to help students during this time. There is a YUSU Covid 19 Community Facebook page, for students to link up and swap tips, events, activities and ideas for dealing with the challenges we are all facing. In addition, the YUSU Advice &#x26; Support Centre (ASC) are available via email.</p>\n<p>Please also remember we are here to offer you support for your wellbeing. You can access the Student Hub, Open Door, and your College teams online. The maths and writing skills centres are also there to support you with your academic needs.</p>\n<p>Please keep checking your University email and the Covid-19 webpages for news and updates. In the meantime please keep yourselves safe, and keep reaching out to us and each other.</p>\n<p>Kind regards</p>\n<p>John Robinson</p>\n<p>Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Teaching, Learning and Students</p>\n<p>Supported and endorsed by:</p>\n<p>Samara Jones, YUSU President</p>\n<p>Giang Nguyen, YUSU Academic Officer</p>","id":"8d552c56-9790-55bd-bdee-190239175f8f","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-york/2020-04-10-14_08_28/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Friday 3 April: UG student email"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VLLASVlP82AirFOxjpQlRs_KmMxPtmxIW46cxfvUgcoucyFP9Vhfz5WGFfrYdArjPdtuJmK5ySCBF0SKWZsJN2Af8SXW4UZD\"></p>\n<p>All student email</p>\n<p>Covid 19 update 7 April : New videos and new guidance for online exams</p>\n<p>Dear students</p>\n<p>As we approach the start of the summer term, I wanted to bring you up to date with the latest information and guidance we have published in the Covid-19 pages including important information about online exams.</p>\n<p>New videos online</p>\n<p>I have received quite a few comments and queries from students since my email last Friday announcing the introduction of a safety net score and further support for PGT dissertations, ISMs and projects. In response I have made the following videos which I hope will help answer your questions:</p>\n<p>New guidance for online exams</p>\n<p>Importantly for many students returning next week you will be undertaking online examinations for the first time. We have written and published guidance and advice to help you prepare for what to do and how these exams might look and feel. Even if your exams are not until later in the term, it is worth reading the guidance now, so you will know what to expect.</p>\n<p>These are unsettling and difficult times for all of us and whilst we will not be able to welcome you back to campus in a physical sense, we are very much looking forward to engaging with you online at the start of the new term.</p>\n<p>Kind regards</p>\n<p>John Robinson</p>\n<p>Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Teaching, Learning and Students</p>","id":"285ac7a7-4086-530b-b81d-cf7952df213e","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-york/2020-04-10-14_08_32/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) updates"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VLLASVlP82AirFOxjpQlRs_KmMxPtmxIW46cxfvUgcoucyFP9Vhfz5WGFfrYdArjPdtuJmK5ySCBF0SKWZsJN2Af8SXW4UZD\"></p>\n<p>Postgraduate taught student email</p>\n<p>Updated PGT Guidance on ISMs, Dissertations and Projects</p>\n<p>Dear Postgraduate Taught Student,</p>\n<p>I hope you are keeping well and safe. This email updates you on support for your Independent Study Modules, Dissertations and Projects, and also provides more general information about studying at this very difficult time.</p>\n<p>Supporting Masters, PGCert and PGDip students</p>\n<p>While everyone is living in unprecedented circumstances, Postgraduate Taught students typically have demands and difficulties beyond those of many others.</p>\n<p>We recognise how unsettling the past few weeks have been for you, and we are committed to explaining how our decisions on policy and the provision of support apply to you. Many of the steps we have taken to support all students are particularly relevant to those with family responsibilities or doing part time work, especially postgraduates. For example, the extended durations of online assessments and the revised exceptional circumstances policy are to help you to perform well, or if your personal situation means you cannot, quickly and straightforwardly get an appropriate adjustment.</p>\n<p>We have also been thinking hard about how we need to adapt the way we recognise students’ achievement in their degree award and transcript. Postgraduate taught students will receive a degree transcript that summarises the difficult and extraordinary conditions under which you have had to complete your studies. We will enable you to demonstrate your ability despite the context of the pandemic, in ways that reflect the nature of your degree, as well as the flexibility that comes from the independence of your study.</p>\n<p>We have given a great deal of thought as to whether a numerical ‘safety net’ --- something we can offer to undergraduate students --- might be possible for postgraduates too. The ‘safety net’ guarantees students’ academic-year averages. It relies on being able to summarise reliably their ‘bankable’ performance before the crisis began. Unfortunately there isn’t sufficient information to do this for postgraduates.</p>\n<p>The undergraduate ‘safety net’ depends on the fact that we are able to take a long-term view of what a student has achieved. As Postgraduate Taught students, you are with us for a much shorter period, and so we do not have a sufficient run of marks within your degree that shows what you are capable of. Many of you have completed only a small portion of the assessed work planned for you this year. Some have completed a single essay, or a poster presentation. We feel it would be unfair to extrapolate a whole award mark based on less than half of the total credits in the year. This could lead to you receiving a very high or a very low mark that does not reflect your capabilities. We really want to ensure that future employers or places of study are able to have an accurate reflection of your achievements.</p>\n<p>We continue to explore other ways to support you towards a degree outcome that reflects your true ability. I referred to some of these earlier; the remainder of this email deals with the crucial area of dissertation support.</p>\n<p>Extensions and sits as if for the first time under exceptional circumstances</p>\n<p>Students on taught postgraduate degrees will be able to ask for extensions on coursework and ‘sits as if for the first time’ of exams at a later date under the special variations to the Exceptional Circumstances Policy without the requirement of evidence. But unlike undergraduates, who will have to wait until the next academic year to join a following cohort if they aren’t able to get a full run of marks by the start of the next academic year, we will be much more flexible in the setting of replacement assessment dates. So you won’t have to wait until next spring or summer to make up assessments that you haven’t been in a position to write during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Supervision and support</p>\n<p>We understand how important your masters dissertation is to you.</p>\n<p>Therefore, please be assured the University is committed to supporting you through your independent study module, dissertation or project. Because each independent project is unique we recognise that the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the social distancing measures will be different for every student.The individual circumstances in which you find yourself will dictate the type and level of support you will need to complete your dissertation. Your support requirements may also change at any point during the next few months. Your dissertation supervisor should have spoken to you about what you had planned to do for your project , and about possible adjustments that can be made to your plan to allow you to continue during the period of social distancing. If that conversation hasn’t yet happened, please contact your supervisor now.</p>\n<p>If you don’t already have a dissertation supervisor, speak to your ‘normal’ supervisor or email your department office, and they will point you to the right person. Departments have already considered how students might be able to access additional online resources, data sets, and human participants in the new environment, and we aim to allow the majority of our Masters students to continue to pursue their topic and to submit dissertations that display their high level of skill and ingenuity.</p>\n<p>Requesting an extension</p>\n<p>Some kinds of projects will be more affected than others. If your currently planned work cannot be done without access to specific facilities or resources, your department can help you to consider alternatives.</p>\n<p>However, if appropriate changes are not possible, or if your future plans or funding are reliant on your having seen through the original plan, you can also apply for an extension to your registration. This will enable you to complete your work when you have access to the resources you need again. Extension requests will not require evidence, but will require that you and your supervisor present a reasonable timetable for the completion of the award.</p>\n<p>We recommend that if you choose to request an extension, you continue to make the most of this current period of time. Please discuss with your supervisor how to best use the time available to you, for example you might spend the time completing your literature review, undertaking preliminary research, working on methodology or planning your project between now and the delayed submission date. The advantage of an extension, over a Leave of Absence, is that you will continue to have access to all of the digital, pastoral, and academic resources of the University during the restrictions we currently face, and we can continue to support you to make progress to allow you to complete your project as soon as possible once things return to normal.</p>\n<p>Requesting a leave of absence</p>\n<p>At any point during the remainder of the year, your ability to study may be hindered or halted completely for example by serious illness, by lack of internet or available IT equipment, by family or work commitments, or in the worst case, by bereavement. If you find that you are not in a position to study for an extended period of time, please discuss your situation with your supervisor. Extensions can be allowed on exams, coursework and on dissertations, and in some rare cases a Leave of Absence until the relevant point in the following academic year may be the best option for you. If you do need to do that, you can ask for a Leave of Absence without having to provide evidence, so long as you let us know before your break begins.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right options for you</p>\n<p>We know that our students’ plans for the future vary hugely, as do their reasons for pursuing a Masters degree. The University (your supervisors, your department, your college, and central support services) are all committed to helping you to achieve your very personal academic goals. Extensions might be exactly the right solution for some, and for others, commitments after September might mean that the timeframe for completing your dissertation is fixed. We know that the support and advice needed will vary from person to person, whether you are undertaking a masters degree to fulfill a lifelong passion for the subject or you are studying as a stepping stone to further study or to progress your career.</p>\n<p>Whatever your circumstances, or motivations for study, an honest conversation with your supervisor can help you make choices that are right for you in a way that will allow you to fulfil your goals notwithstanding the unprecedented circumstances.</p>\n<p>Supporting your wellbeing</p>\n<p>We are committed to supporting your health and wellbeing during this difficult time and have put in place a number of measures to ensure that you can access relevant support remotely. University of York students now have access to the Big White Wall. This is a 24/7 online peer and professional support service with trained counsellors. Big White Wall provides a safe space to share your thoughts and feelings. While on the site, you are totally anonymous to other members in the community.</p>\n<p>We have also created a new web page all about looking after your wellbeing during the pandemic. It brings together and outlines the support available from the University, the Students’ Unions and has links to useful external advice.</p>\n<p>These two new services complement existing University services, such as:</p>\n<p>the Student Hub and Colleges who are happy to arrange telephone or email appointments to discuss anything that is worrying you - from advice on your private rental contract, to problems with your flatmate or reporting self-isolation.</p>\n<p>the Open Door team continues to offer appointments. If you are new to Open Door, simply complete the online referral form and they will get in touch with you via email or telephone.</p>\n<p>the Writing and Language Skills Centre, and the Math Skills Centre continue to support you improving your academic and language skills</p>\n<p>The Students’ Unions are also working hard to help students during this time. YUSU and GSA have launched a range of online wellbeing initiatives. 'Keep Home and Carry On' from the GSA includes a calendar of online activities such as: fitness schedules, music playlists, family activities, online coffee meet-ups, book recommendations and even online karaoke. And, there is a YUSU Covid 19 Community Facebook page, for students to link up and swap tips, events, activities and ideas for dealing with the challenges we are all facing. In addition, the YUSU Advice &#x26; Support Centre (ASC) and the GSA Advice Service are available via email.</p>\n<p>Please keep checking your University email and the Covid-19 webpages for news and updates.

Assessment will be adjusted to make fair allowance for the fact that you are now studying in a different environment, away from your library, seminar rooms and laboratories.</p>\n<p>Examination formats have been changed to match the different circumstances, and in some modules examinations may be cancelled altogether. You will soon hear from each of your module co-ordinators what your assessments and examinations will look like.</p>\n<p>Moreover, once we have overall module results, we will analyse them against the historic record in order to detect any anomalies or dramatic changes and make adjustments accordingly. In short, we will do everything we can to ensure that you will be awarded fair grades.</p>\n<p>For undergraduate students nervous about entering your intended Honours pathway, or about the impact of the current semester’s grades on your overall degree classification, we are putting in place two new sets of regulations for this semester only:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Honours Entry</strong>  – If you are about to start an Honours programme in 2020-2021 (including entry to Honours in January 2021), any grade-related Honours entry prerequisites for modules taught in Semester 2, 2019-2020 will be reduced from 11.0 (or an average of 11.0 across a range of required 2000-level modules) to a simple pass at 7.0. This means that as long as you have passed all of the required modules for Honours entry and have garnered the requisite number of credits at the right level, you will be free to progress to your intended Honour programme. This will also apply to passes achieved for Semester 2 modules during the re-assessment diet in August 2020.</li>\n<li><strong>Honours Classification</strong>  – All of our students completing modules at 3000- or 4000-level or taught modules at 5000-level in Semester 2 will have the option of having any module result retrospectively S-coded on the basis of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 crisis. This will be in addition to any S-codes awarded for other reasons in line with the current policy. This means that students can, in this circumstance only, ask for an S-code to be attached to one, several or all of their Semester 2 modules (including year-long modules reported in Semester 2) after they have been notified of the module result. S-coded module result(s) will not be used for the calculation of the degree classification if they have a negative effect on the class of degree awarded. Any module S-coded in this way will not count against the overall maximum number of S-coded credits available to students in other semesters and for other reasons.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This means that you can study with confidence, knowing that if – in spite of your best efforts and our determination to grade you as fairly as possible – you are not satisfied with a module result, you can ask for it not to be factored into the calculation of your degree classification.</p>\n<p>Please await communications from your School regarding the precise format of the assessment and examinations in your modules.</p>","id":"01638225-2688-5d95-bb2c-5a5816d6cd55","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/uk/uk-st-andrews/2020-04-09-14_23_28/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How will I be assessed?"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"20c99ef1-22e7-5187-b603-e56c12c5531e","countryCode":"uk","hasApiCode":true,"apiCode":"unitedkingdom"}}}
