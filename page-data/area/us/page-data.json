American Airlines customers will be rebooked, if necessary, to one of those airports by our Reservations and Airport teams. * Foreign nationals who have traveled to Iran within the last 14 days will be denied permission to travel to the United States. These entry requirements are in addition to those imposed by the presidential proclamation on Jan. 31, which restricted entry to the U.S. from mainland China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). American continues to work closely with U.S. authorities to comply with these new orders while treating all of our customers with respect. American is committed to taking care of any affected customers by assisting them with rebooking options and full refunds. Our team is proactively reaching out to customers who may be affected by this travel restriction to ensure they are accommodated. ### Frequently Asked Questions </p>\n<p><strong>When do these orders go into effect?</strong> </p>\n<p>These orders apply to all flights departing for the United States after 5 p.m. ET on March 2. To be clear, it does not apply to flights that depart prior to 5 p.m. ET on March 2. </p>\n<p><strong>What airports are approved entry points for customers entering the United States if the customer has visited Iran within the last 14 days?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Atlanta: Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) </li>\n<li>Dallas-Fort Worth: Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) </li>\n<li>Detroit: Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW)</li>\n<li>Newark, New Jersey: Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) </li>\n<li>Honolulu: Daniel K.

Team members must have their valid American identification in hand.

( PDF) </a> </p>\n<p>American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) today announced additional adjustments to its schedule in response to decreased travel demand due to coronavirus (COVID-19). The company plans to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce international capacity for the summer peak by 10% versus the previous selling schedule, including a 55% reduction in trans-Pacific capacity. </li>\n<li>Reduce domestic capacity in April by 7.5% versus the current schedule. New schedule changes include: </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Asia</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Suspending service to mainland China and Hong Kong (HKG) from Los Angeles (LAX) through the summer.</li>\n<li>Suspending service to mainland China from Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) through the summer. </li>\n<li>Suspending service to HKG from DFW through June. DFW-HKG will resume with a reduced schedule in July.</li>\n<li>Extending the suspension of service to Seoul, South Korea (ICN) from DFW into early May. </li>\n<li>Flights to Tokyo’s Narita International Airport (NRT) and Haneda International Airport (HND) from LAX and DFW will be operated with smaller widebody aircraft beginning in May. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Europe</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Suspending service to Rome (FCO) from Philadelphia (PHL) effective immediately through the end of April.</li>\n<li>Extending the suspension of service to Milan (MXP), and suspending flights to FCO from Chicago (ORD) and Charlotte (CLT) through early summer. </li>\n<li>Delaying the seasonal resumption of flights to Barcelona (BCN) from CLT and to Venice (VCE) from ORD to early June. Also delaying the seasonal resumption of flights to FCO from New York (JFK) and DFW through the end of April and suspending operation of our second daily flight from DFW to FCO for the summer. </li>\n<li>Reducing service to Paris (CDG) and Madrid (MAD) for parts of May and June. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>South America</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Flights to Montevideo, Uruguay (MVD) from Miami (MIA) will become seasonal, with service ending in May and resuming in December.</li>\n<li>Flights to Santiago, Chile (SCL) from DFW will be suspended through April. Widebody aircraft will be redeployed on key domestic routes in American’s network. American will also introduce new seasonal service between ORD and Honolulu (HNL) this summer on a Boeing 787-9. These capacity reductions assume no slot waivers are in place. At airports where demand exceeds airfield and/or terminal capacity, access is governed by slots that grant airlines permission to take off and land at specific times. Given the drop-off in demand related to COVID-19, American has requested temporary relief from this usage requirement – otherwise known as requesting a slot waiver – to better align capacity with demand without the risk of losing valuable takeoff and landing slots for the future. American will continue to review its network and make adjustments as needed if waivers are granted. Full details on these schedule adjustments can be found <a href=\"#adjustments\">below</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Domestic network</h4>\n<p>For April, American will reduce domestic capacity by 7.5% to match demand. The airline will decrease frequencies in markets with robust schedule patterns and will cancel routes where customers can be easily reaccommodated. </p>\n<h4>Taking care of customers</h4>\n<p>American will continue to take care of customers as this situation develops. The airline <a href=\"#waivers\">recently announced</a> that change fees will be waived for customers who purchased tickets prior to March 1 for travel through April 30. Additionally, American’s Reservations team will contact affected customers directly by email or telephone. Customers who booked through a travel agent will be contacted by their agency directly.

While United's international schedule will still be reduced by about 90% in April, the airline will continue flying six daily operations to and from the following destinations – covering Asia, Australia, Latin America, the Middle East and Europe – in an effort to get customers where they need to be.

Based on this statement and the recommendations to Canadians to control the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19, we have made impactful decisions related to our operations. On Sunday, March 22 at 11:59 p.m. MDT, we will suspend scheduled commercial operations for all international and transborder flights for a 30 day period. To be clear, this means our final commercially scheduled flights from international and transborder destinations will launch on Sunday night by 11:59 p.m. local time; after that, we will be operating rescue and repatriation flights with our partners. As of tonight, international and transborder tickets are no longer available for sale during this 30 day period. On Wednesday, March 18 at 11:59 p.m. MDT, WestJet will suspend all outbound international ticket sales for travel until Sunday, March 22 at 11:59 p.m. MDT, so we are no longer sending Canadians out of the country and can instead focus on bringing them home. To assist Canadians in returning home on short notice, we are in the process of lowering prices on our remaining seats into Canada in all cabins. In addition, we will also reduce our domestic schedule by approximately 50 per cent. At this point, all network changes are in place for the next 30 days. WestJetters are known for our level of care and this situation is no different. While this is a difficult time, we now have the responsibility as a Canadian airline to bring our citizens home. <em>-Statement from Ed Sims, WestJet President and Chief Executive Officer</em> For more details, and to understand how this may impact you, visit <a href=\"https://blog.westjet.com/options-for-westjet-guests-suspension-of-commercial-operations-transborder-and-international/\"> <em>Options for WestJet guests</em> </a>. </p>","id":"eba20697-89ea-5d6e-8ecf-450e230b5849","fields":{"pathname":"/article/airlines/2020-04-09-westjet-01/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"WestJet statement on operations and network from Ed Sims, President and CEO"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>**Read this article in <a href=\"https://news.delta.com/actualizacion-de-programacion-donde-vuela-delta-fuera-de-los-eeuu-en-abril\">Spanish</a> or <a href=\"https://news.delta.com/atualizacao-na-programacao-para-onde-delta-esta-voando-fora-dos-estados-unidos-em-abril\">Portuguese</a>.</p>\n<p>**Editor's Note April 7: Since publication, Delta has suspended Atlanta-Toronto, Atlanta-Cancun (except April 25), Atlanta-London, JFK-Montreal, JFK-San Juan, Minneapolis-Saskatoon, and Minneapolis-Winnipeg.

Racist language and pornographic images from unauthorized participants have also disrupted sessions at schools across the country, including the University of Southern California and the University of Texas at Austin.</p>\n<p>“The incident was awful, no doubt,” said Shayna Hill, Employee Forum chair. “But I had several meetings prior to our public meeting with our Employee Forum team to strategize on how to handle things if something went wrong. It would have been much worse had we not been ready. The team absolutely stepped up and handled it. In the end it was a productive two-hour meeting with two presenters and some critical updates from our Human Resources partners.”</p>\n<p>To combat attacks, ITS recently added an option to restrict meeting access to only participants logged into UNC Zoom, according to Dennis Schmidt, assistant vice chancellor and chief information security officer. Before the change, anyone with a Zoom account who had a meeting ID or link, including external users, could potentially join Zoom meetings.</p>\n<h2>Change the default to “on”</h2>\n<p>The default for the new setting is “off.” Activate the setting by editing your Zoom profile and turn on “Only authenticated users can join Zoom meetings.” The default login option is now UNC Zoom only.</p>\n<p>Anyone with an active Onyen can create a Zoom account at zoom.unc.edu.</p>\n<p>For users, ITS also offers the following instructions:</p>\n<p>When you change the restriction setting, you are doing so in your profile.\nThe change “sticks,” so once set, you do not have to reset it every time you create a session.\nAny new sessions that you create will have this setting applied to them.\nIf you have any meetings already scheduled, the change you’ve made will not apply to those meetings. Edit existing meetings using the steps on the Keep Teaching website.\nZoom sub-groups, including those discussing confidential student or health information, are susceptible to bombing. The setting cannot be forced to “on” for groups or sub-groups, so session owners should set this option in their user setting.</p>\n<p>Check Zoom recording settings and Zoom meeting settings to make sure your meetings are protected.</p>\n<p>The Keep Teaching website also outlines settings and how to apply these safeguards to ensure privacy. Settings include:</p>\n<p>Require a meeting password\nRequire a password for participants joining by telephone\nAllow only authenticated users to join\nAdd a waiting room\nHow to remove and keep removed participants from re-joining.\nThe site also reminds faculty about mentioning the University’s Honor Code in regard to course content and intellectual property and points faculty to an additional service called Warpwire for preventing downloads of content. Warpwire is available for Sakai users.</p>","id":"bff36aaf-cef2-5ee6-b8d0-5453e4811626","fields":{"pathname":"/article/learning/2020-04-03-stop-zoom-bombs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"北卡教堂山：教你如何让zoom上的学习更安全"}}},{"node":{"html":"","id":"1ea8cc09-e1e0-558d-8ff9-0384a72e3bb4","fields":{"pathname":"/article/learning/columbia-university-free-ebook/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"哥伦比亚大学为学生提供免费图书资源"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h1>汉化征集：征集汉化文章列表</h1>\n<p>以下为截止2020-04-09，本站需要汉化的文章列表</p>\n<h2>汉化</h2>\n<p>如果你可以协助汉化全文或给出导读，请前往covid19-datahub的共建页面，点击<a

This letter shares important details and information – the logistics of moving out, what we know at this point about financial issues, and how you will still be supported. I also want to confirm that to date there are no known cases of COVID-19 in the AU community.</p>\n<p>First, though, let me acknowledge what this transition means to all of us. I’m heartbroken that you will not be able to be on campus to finish the year (and, for many, your AU careers) in the cherished company of your friends and classmates. All of you have had so much going on and planned this semester that would have made being together in person so important and special – events, internships, activities, shared projects, personal plans.</p>\n<p>Even though we know it’s necessary, and while our faculty and staff are absolutely dedicated to continuing our core educational commitment to you at the highest level, there is much that you will miss by not being here in person. I do not want to minimize that loss, or the stress and disruption of this sudden change for you and your families.</p>\n<p>We also know that this transition will have particular stresses for some members of our community. We are committed to doing everything we can to support you and will stay connected with you. We will do our absolute best to minimize the very real challenges faced by the most vulnerable of us.</p>\n<p>We are here for you. Let us be here for each other. Our community has come together like I have never seen before, and though most of what we’re all doing to meet this crisis may not be visible and is happening behind the scenes, it’s incredible. I am absolutely convinced that is true for every student, family, department, and program at AU, and that we will all meet this challenge.</p>\n<p>Through it all, we must remember that we are a community committed to our values of inclusivity and human dignity. Let us be here for each other during this time and treat each other with utmost respect, compassion and care.</p>\n<p>Now I’d like to share some of the key logistics in areas of student life as we implement these changes. Faculty will be in touch about academic issues. If you don’t hear from your faculty members within a few days, please reach out to them.</p>\n<p>Vacating Residence Halls</p>\n<p>We have made this difficult decision in order to safeguard the health of students who share very close quarters, including bathrooms and eating facilities. To keep everyone as safe as possible, we need students to return to their permanent residence and complete their coursework remotely. A follow-up communication detailing move-out processes, storage and shipping will be sent by Housing and Residence Life to all affected residents shortly.</p>\n<p>Move-out Timing. Now through Monday, March 23 at 5 pm.</p>\n<p>Students Unable to Leave Residence Halls</p>\n<p>We recognize that in rare cases some students may be unable to return to a permanent residence for various significant reasons and will need to stay in their residence halls. For instance, some international students will not be able to return at this time to their permanent address in their country of residence or home country, and some students may have other serious reasons to remain on campus.</p>\n<p>Residence halls will remain available to students where necessary, although we expect the vast majority of residents to return home. This will make it easier for remaining students to maintain social distance and stay as healthy as possible.</p>\n<p>Process for remaining. For students who feel that they are in a serious situation that may require them to stay in the residence halls, we ask that they please contact us as soon as possible at EmergencyHousing20@american.edu</p>\n<p>For students who feel that they are in a serious situation that may require them to stay in the residence halls, we ask that they please contact us as soon as possible at EmergencyHousing20@american.edu Dining on campus. We will assure that at least some dining options remain available on campus. More information will follow.</p>\n<p>Students Living Off Campus</p>\n<p>If you live off campus, staying or leaving is a choice you must make for yourself. Either way, you will be studying online and there will not be campus activities. If you live and work in the community, please follow recommended hygiene and social distancing practices. (This also applies to students returning to permanent addresses.)</p>\n<p>Financial Concerns and Support</p>\n<p>Housing and meal plan costs. We are working on prorating these costs.

Food insecurity. The AU Market will remain open. This is a discrete, free resource for all students who remain on campus or in the DMV area and experience food insecurity.</p>\n<p>Student Jobs and Internships</p>\n<p>All student workers should reach out to their employers to discuss options. Students with Federal Work Study (FWS) will continue to receive their payments, which has been made permissible through new Department of Education guidelines. For students with on-campus jobs that are not work study, supervisors are being encouraged to find ways to allow students to work remotely.</p>\n<p>Students should also reach out directly to faculty supervising their internships so they can explore with the employer whether remote work is possible.</p>\n<p>Graduate assistants and research assistants should consult with their faculty supervisors regarding how to continue their assignments remotely.</p>\n<p>Some Important Student Services</p>\n<p>Student Health Center will be fully operational. We know that many students require ongoing health care (e.g. refills, psychiatric care, etc.) during this time. Students who are less than 50 miles away (or can come to campus) can make appointments with the Student Health Center for ongoing care. Students further away should contact their home healthcare provider for ongoing care.

As we do, our focus is you – our students, faculty, and staff – and your health and safety.</p>\n<p>I am sending this update as we make a major temporary change in how we deliver on a core part of our mission. Following spring break, American University will shift to online classes for three weeks. The university will remain open and we are ensuring support for students, faculty, and staff. Critical functions for teaching, research and other services will continue. This includes shifting some services online. We will also continue to monitor the situation and will provide ongoing guidance to faculty and staff to support their work and well-being.</p>\n<p>While the risk to our community remains low at this time, this could change quickly. Our precautionary actions will help limit potential exposure to COVID-19 and enhance our ability to manage and/or isolate any suspected or confirmed cases that may occur at the university. A three-week period of online classes will reduce the number of people living in close proximity on our campus, limit interactions, and hopefully see reductions in the overall spread of COVID-19 in the country and the DC region. The currently planned schedule also provides enough time in April to resume on-campus instruction, conduct finals, and complete the semester’s requirements if the conditions support that decision.</p>\n<p>We are taking the following actions to safeguard our community and continue our educational and research mission:</p>\n<p>Spring break will be extended through Monday, March 16 and Tuesday, March 17, and classes are canceled for those two days.</p>\n<p>Effective Wednesday, March 18 all American University classes and instruction will move fully online. Classes will continue online through Friday, April 3.</p>\n<p>Washington College of Law (WCL) classes will begin online on Monday, March 23, following the college’s spring break next week, and continue through Friday, April 3.</p>\n<p>All in-person classes are currently scheduled to resume on Monday, April 6. We will evaluate this timetable based on the evolving situation and provide updates as needed.</p>\n<p>All students will receive instructions from their faculty regarding how their classes will operate prior to the resumption of classes on Wednesday, March 18. Please be sure to watch your AU email regularly during this period, as it will be the main source of information from your instructors and the university.</p>\n<p>Our campus will remain open and operational during this time. Core functions and services for our students will be accessible remotely. The COVID-19 Resources page will continue to provide information.</p>\n<p>Further information for faculty and staff will be forthcoming from the Human Resources team and department leadership.</p>\n<p>You can find additional information and answers to frequently asked questions on our COVID-19 Resources website, which will be updated regularly.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage students to return to their homes (or stay home if already there) for this period. Residence halls will remain open for students who cannot return home. Dining and other campus services will continue, though there may be modifications to schedules. Students can return to campus to pick up educational materials and personal belongings.</p>\n<p>For our faculty and staff, offices are open and functioning. As part of supporting our teams, Human Resources will provide guidance to department leaders and managers for preparations and flexibility, including the possibility of expanded telework depending on how the COVID-19 situation evolves. All units will plan for continuity of operations, including identifying essential services and backup plans. We will continue to work with individual team members on appropriate arrangements for those who may have health concerns, need to support family who are sick, or may experience interruptions in child or family care.</p>\n<p>We should all continue good health hygiene practices and follow guidance from health authorities that previous notes and our FAQ have outlined. Working on Ebola and Zika when I was Secretary of Health and Human Services, I know the importance of the team on the ground – from public health officials to universities and local communities – coming together to help. The collaboration is key to getting through this uncertain time with the least possible harm to our health and daily lives.</p>\n<p>I want to thank our faculty and staff as they work hard to implement these initiatives; they are dedicated to the best interests and success of our students and the AU family. I also want to thank our students for taking the COVID-19 situation seriously, following guidance, and remaining committed to their academic pursuits. We will continue to provide updates and you can check the COVID-19 Resources page for information and details.</p>\n<p>Our AU community is at its best when we are working together to take on challenges. While these times are difficult, I know your dedication and commitment to each other will help us all see this through. Be safe, be well, and I look forward to seeing you all soon.</p>\n<p>Sylvia</p>","id":"4f220b21-b6fe-5eb4-8ffc-081b3291c5dc","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-american/2020-04-08-23_30_54/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"3/10 COVID-19 Update: AU to temporarily conduct all classes online following extended spring break."}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.american.edu/customcf/2016-redesign/images/social_graph.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Dear AU Community,</p>\n<p>American University continues to monitor the 2019 Novel Coronavirus situation and take appropriate steps to protect the health and well-being of our community.

Guidance from federal, state, and local governments indicates that the virus will likely still affect our communities when summer classes begin in May. Continuing our online instruction through the summer will safeguard the health and well-being of our community, provide flexibility for our students, and support our ongoing educational mission.</p>\n<p>In this difficult time, I know many students and families are facing health and financial challenges. We are committed to supporting our AU community, and I am pleased to announce that undergraduate, graduate, and Washington College of Law (WCL) summer courses will be discounted by 10 percent this year. This discount will provide students with some financial relief and additional options for advancing their education. For a typical summer schedule of two courses (six credits), this discount translates into approximately $1,000 in savings.</p>\n<p>Summer sessions provide our students with an opportunity to fulfill core requirements, complete major courses, or advance in graduate studies. Led by our expert faculty, summer classes deliver the robust, high-quality American University academic experience that helps our students thrive. We want to help students remain on track academically or advance more quickly towards their degree. Provost Myers, our deans, and our faculty are exploring additional classes for this summer to help meet the needs of our students, so please continue to visit the Registrar’s Schedule of Classes.</p>\n<p>Summer registration for graduate and undergraduate students begins on Monday, April 6 and continues through June and July, depending on the start date of each session. There are no assigned registration times for summer classes. Students can check the for additional information. Summer courses will be offered under the university’s traditional grading system, and our academic advisors can help students develop a plan to help them get the most out of their summer term. Further details on summer programs are available at www.american.edu/summer.</p>\n<p>By quickly adapting our summer classes and providing some financial relief, we want to help our students adjust as their summer plans may be disrupted by COVID-19. We know many students are facing new challenges and hardships, from canceled jobs and internships to postponed travel to the stresses of the current situation. We hope this opportunity can help alleviate some of the burden and provide new possibilities.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your support as we continue our response to COVID-19. While the situation is difficult for all of us, please know that we are dedicated to providing the best educational opportunities for our students.</p>\n<p>Be safe and be well.</p>\n<p>Sylvia</p>","id":"f82dc845-20c0-5663-a338-64c6b38d1956","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-american/2020-04-10-14_01_49/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"4/3 COVID-19 Update: Summer Classes and Providing Support and Opportunities for Our Students"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.baylor.edu/images/bu/bayloruniversity_social-media.png\"></p>\n<p>Dear Baylor Faculty:</p>\n<p>We continue to receive messages regarding your incredible contributions and sacrifices on behalf of our students during these unprecedented times. Yes, our challenges are great as we progress through the spring semester – together and united – but every day we are encouraged and inspired by all of you. Baylor Faculty truly are special, and we might add exceptional, in your dedication to our students and our Christian mission. From maintaining live “office” hours and conducting regular student wellness checks to adjusting time zones to support the learning of our international students, you are not only going above and beyond, but simply doing what Baylor Faculty do. For this, we thank you.</p>\n<p>Today we jointly want to provide two significant faculty-focused updates, based on our collaborative work and in recognition of the many professional and personal disruptions you have faced this semester due to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Course Evaluations</p>\n<p>Student course evaluations for the spring semester will not be used as part of the annual evaluation process nor as a mandated part of the promotion and tenure dossier. Instead, results from student course evaluations will be provided only to the individual faculty member so that they may use this feedback as a way of improving their online instruction. Since this is the first time most of our faculty have taught online, soliciting feedback from students is important. Let us assure you that these student evaluations are instructive for you only, and you will not be harmed by the swift change to an unfamiliar pedagogy.</p>\n<p>For the University to learn from this period of online instruction, we will review the student course evaluation data only in the aggregate. Furthermore, we also will ask the faculty for feedback on how we, as the Administration and Faculty Senate, can improve in supporting your teaching in an online environment.</p>\n<p>Tenure Clock</p>\n<p>All current tenure-track faculty will be granted a one-year extension to their respective tenure clocks. Any of these faculty may decline this one-year extension, but in order to do so, faculty currently in Years 1-4 must “opt out” by informing their department chair, dean, and Vice Provost Jim Bennighof in an email message by July 31, 2020 that they are declining the extension.</p>\n<p>Faculty in Year 5 (who are currently scheduled for Tenure Review during the 2020-21 academic year) who wish to decline the tenure clock extension must do so in the same way by May 15, 2020. We encourage these faculty to notify their department chair, dean, and Vice Provost Bennighof via email as soon as possible so as to facilitate the timely pursuit of the process (especially the solicitation of external review letters).</p>\n<p>Faculty who receive the tenure clock extension will not undergo formal annual tenure-track reviews during the 2020-21 academic year. Instead, these reviews will be held in the 2021-22 academic year.</p>\n<p>Assessment of work done during this period of disruption will follow the principles stated in Section III.F of the Tenure Policy with regard to extensions to the tenure time limit.</p>\n<p>Any faculty member seeking advice about whether to opt out of this extension should consult with the chair of his or her department. Questions about the process should be directed to Vice Provost Bennighof at James_Bennighof@baylor.edu.</p>\n<p>In Closing</p>\n<p>The decisions related to these important issues reflect the collaborative work of the deans, vice provosts and Faculty Senate, with the support of the President’s Council. As President Livingstone communicated last week, the University faces many unknowns in the weeks and months ahead. One thing that’s certain, however, is the appreciation we have for our faculty and your service to Baylor and her students.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>","id":"2c4f59d7-f9ce-5c1b-bceb-66fb2727ec17","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-baylor/2020-04-08-23_31_32/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Faculty updates on course evaluations, tenure clock"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.baylor.edu/images/bu/bayloruniversity_social-media.png\"></p>\n<p>Dear Baylor Students,</p>\n<p>Over the past several weeks, you have experienced unique challenges, such as relocating to permanent residences and being separated from family and friends while adapting to new methods of learning. We thank you for your patience during this time as we have made critical and difficult decisions to keep you, faculty, and staff safe.</p>\n<p>One of the recent decisions we made was developing a plan to address the financial implications due to COVID-19. We understand that COVID-19 has impacted students and their families in profound ways, including financially.</p>\n<p>We are happy to share that the University will provide prorated credits for housing, meal plans, and parking permits and will pay students receiving federal work-study. In certain circumstances, the credits provided may result in a reimbursement, based on certain criteria. Below are the specifics of the plan.</p>\n<p>Housing</p>\n<p>Students who were not able to remain in the residence halls for the remainder of the semester will receive a credit for their housing room rates, which will be prorated for the dates between March 16 through May 12. Financial Services will process credits for housing by Wednesday, April 8, 2020.</p>\n<p>Meal Plans</p>\n<p>All meal plans will be prorated March 16 through May 16 by the daily rate associated with the plan. If applicable, any unused Dining Dollars will be rolled over to the next semester. Financial Services will process credits for meal plans by Wednesday, April 8, 2020.</p>\n<p>Parking</p>\n<p>Students who paid for on-campus parking will receive a $100 credit for their parking passes, which is the standard amount offered for refunds made in March. Financial Services will process parking credits by Wednesday, April 8, 2020.</p>\n<p>Payment Due Dates</p>\n<p>The University is eliminating late financial settlement fees and registration holds for non-payment for the summer and fall semesters. For students unable to pay the remaining bills for the spring semester, the University will roll these balances to the summer or fall term. Rolled over balances can be included in summer or fall payment plans.</p>\n<p>Work-study</p>\n<p>For students with federal work-study jobs, Baylor will provide a lump sum payment based on the average number of hours the student worked during the three pay periods before spring break. The amount of a payment will not exceed the student's total federal work-study awarded amount. These payments will be processed through Baylor's Payroll Office by Friday, April 10, 2020.</p>\n<p>If a student is not eligible to be paid federal work-study for hours not worked or receives University work-study, we encourage students to seek support by completing the application for the President's Excellence Fund. If you have specific questions about your federal work-study eligibility, please email the financial aid counseling team at financial_aid@baylor.edu.</p>\n<p>We recognize the challenges and hardships that many of you are facing. We appreciate your understanding as Baylor transitioned to online course instruction during this unprecedented time. While the course delivery has changed for the last half of the semester due to circumstances beyond Baylor's control, classes are still taking place with the same faculty, and you will receive credit for the classes completed. We have heard positive reports from professors of how well you are adapting to online courses, and we are grateful for your approach to learning and your resiliency, especially during this time.</p>\n<p>We look forward to when we can welcome you all back to campus and Waco.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Baylor University Financial Services</p>\n<p>For questions, please email coronavirus@baylor.edu.</p>","id":"2337e3f1-207a-539a-80ec-91c66463e39c","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-baylor/2020-04-08-23_31_38/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Important Information About COVID-19 Credits/Refunds"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.baylor.edu/images/bu/bayloruniversity_social-media.png\"></p>\n<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>\n<p>The spring 2020 semester has presented many unprecedented circumstances for Baylor University’s students, faculty and staff as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19). In recognition of these challenges, undergraduate students will have the opportunity to elect to convert any of their spring course grades to Pass/Fail at the end of the semester once their final grades have been submitted.</p>\n<p>This policy, which has been approved by the Deans and President’s Council, is for the spring 2020 semester only and reflects the University’s prioritization of the health and well-being of our campus community, as well as the ongoing continuity of our academic mission.</p>\n<p>I appreciate this recommendation from the Faculty Senate, as well as the input of the Deans and many within the academic advising community. Our discussions were a great model of shared governance, particularly in response to the difficult situation that currently faces our students and faculty.</p>\n<p>I ask that you carefully review the policy that is currently posted on the Provost’s website. A few key points for you to consider as you evaluate the Pass/Fail option:</p>\n<p>At the end of the spring 2020 semester, faculty will submit course grades based upon the grading scale in their syllabi, as they would do at the end of any other semester.</p>\n<p>Any course in which a student has earned a C- or above is eligible to be converted to “Pass” based on student election.</p>\n<p>Courses for which “Pass” or “Fail” is elected by the student will not count toward GPA calculations. Please note that some course prerequisites and degree progression standards require a specific grade — for example, a “B” — for progression. The University will allow a grade of “Pass” to satisfy these requirements. However, even though a grade of “Pass” at the end of the spring 2020 semester will allow a student to progress forward within the University’s system, electing a grade of “Pass” does not mean that students — especially those within professional schools that lead to professional licensure/certification — should elect the “Pass” option and move forward within their major. We strongly encourage students to have robust conversations with their respective dean’s office, academic advisor(s), and/or department faculty regarding their preparedness to proceed to subsequent courses.</p>\n<p>Degree candidates intending to graduate in May 2020 will have between May 12 at 5 p.m. and May 15 at 5 p.m. to identify those courses for which they would like to convert their assigned grade to a Pass/Fail basis.</p>\n<p>All other undergraduate students will have between May 13 at 5 p.m. and May 20 at 5 p.m. to identify those courses for which they would like to convert their assigned grade to a Pass/Fail basis.</p>\n<p>A detailed set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is currently being developed and will be posted on the Office of the Registrar website within the week.</p>\n<p>Academic Calendar Updates</p>\n<p>In recognition of the extended spring break in response to the initial COVID-19 outbreak, we have made the following changes to the spring semester academic calendar:</p>\n<p>The deadline to drop a course or withdraw from the University has been extended one week, from March 30 to April 6.</p>\n<p>The beginning of Early Registration for the summer and fall semesters has been moved one week later, from March 31 to April 7.</p>\n<p>Faculty have the option to use previously scheduled holidays – the Monday following Easter (April 13) and Dia del Oso (April 21) – as additional course instruction days, as needed.</p>\n<p>Student Academic Resources</p>\n<p>Summary</p>\n<p>With this semester’s transition to online course instruction, the Paul L. Foster Student Success Center will continue to provide its full array of support services to students and faculty. These services are now offered online using various tools such as Microsoft Teams, Navigate, Zoom, and WebEx. If you are in need of academic assistance, I strongly encourage you visit the Success Center’s website or the many resources found at the KeepLearning and KeepTeaching websites.Again, thank you for your feedback regarding the new Pass/Fail policy for the spring 2020 semester, as well as for your continued patience and understanding as we work through the days and weeks ahead.

The University’s employees are permitted by the shelter-in-place orders to continue to come to work in order to carry out the University’s essential functions. We write to provide clarity regarding who should and should not be coming to work at the campus to perform duties related to distance learning and research consistent with the procedures that the campus has now established for providing remote learning and research continuity.</p>\n<p>This Executive Order issues directions regarding which employees and faculty members are permitted to come to campus today through April 7, while the Alameda County shelter-in-place order is in effect, for the purpose of carrying out remote instruction and engaging in essential research activities. This directive supersedes all earlier communications.</p>\n<p>Please see the detailed information below. These are campus directives that everyone in our research and teaching communities must follow. They are not guidelines.</p>\n<p>Who this directive covers</p>\n<p>This message is a formal employment directive issued by the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost and the Vice Chancellor for Administration and it applies to all employees and faculty, including visiting scholars and visiting student researchers, who are engaged in instruction and research activities. This directive does not apply to those employees who already are working from home except as necessary to support essential activities, consistent with the direction of their supervisor. This directive does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is essential. Employees and faculty who come to campus for reasons inconsistent with this directive are subject to discipline.</p>\n<p>Remote instruction</p>\n<p>Employees and faculty members may come to the campus only to engage in and directly support the delivery of remote learning instruction (and the limited, specific preparation necessary for such instruction) that cannot be accomplished from home. We have suspended our course capture service as of today. As you make the change to fully-remote instruction, please visit our Instructional Resilience Resources site to take advantage of the virtual consultation services (outlined below) offered by Research Teaching and Learning (RLT). The team is here to support you as best as possible as you transition in a virtual environment. We offer individual virtual consultations with staff who can help guide you on best practices and technical tools. Consultation services can be scheduled in the following ways:</p>\n<p>For virtual 1:1 consultations with the Center for Teaching and Learning schedule at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/CTL-Consult\">http://bit.ly/CTL-Consult</a></p>\n<p>For Zoom/bCourses virtual tutorials and webinars with Digital Learning Services schedule at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/DLSconsultations\">http://bit.ly/DLSconsultations</a></p>\n<p>Research</p>\n<p>Principal investigators (PIs) and their research groups/staff may engage in only those research continuity activities that have been specifically approved by the Vice Chancellor for Research. See CalMessages of March 9 and March 17 for further detail. If you are uncertain as to whether the research activity that you are presently supporting is approved to continue during this period, fill in this form by 5 pm today. PIs will be notified about whether they have approval to continue their research on a rolling basis starting March 18, through March 20.</p>\n<p>No one supporting the campus research enterprise can come to campus to support or engage in activities that have not been designated by the campus as appropriate. If you are being inappropriately pressured to come to your workplace, please contact the Vice Chancellor for Research, the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies, or the Assistant Vice Chancellor for People &#x26; Culture.</p>\n<p>Building access</p>\n<p>Please be advised that suspension of building access (including key-card access) to many campus administrative and research buildings is imminent. This action is necessary to secure and clean campus buildings. Building managers will be informed prior to suspension of access and will communicate information regarding building closure to occupants.</p>\n<p>Supervisors, chairs, and building managers should begin compiling lists of employees and faculty who will continue to require building access on an exceptional basis in order to enable distance learning activities and research activities approved by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research. Employees and faculty who believe that they should have such access should immediately communicate their needs to their supervisor or department chair.</p>\n<p>When working from home has limitations</p>\n<p>Instructors and the staff who support them may come to campus in order to access the internet and other campus resources for the purpose of delivery of remote learning. No employee or faculty member supporting instruction or research may decide to come to their office to work, for purposes other than delivering instruction, solely because their home internet access is not adequate or because their conditions at home are otherwise not conducive to working efficiently. The University understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. The campus has adopted an emergency procurement process to enable employees and faculty to obtain equipment and internet access to enable them to work from home. Employees and faculty who need these resources should request them from their supervisor or Chair.</p>\n<p>A word of thanks</p>\n<p>We know that a number of changes have gone into effect quickly and during an already stressful time. We want to thank you for your support and reiterate that these changes are designed to protect our community and to follow the new shelter-in-place order, while maintaining the essential, critical functions of the university.</p>\n<p>Please continue to support each other as we work through these challenging times, and be well.</p>","id":"3836b781-cb1b-54bb-a1b3-e54bf8c0564a","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-berkeley/2020-04-08-23_41_02/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus response: Executive order regarding remote instruction and research"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sather-gate-750.jpg\"></p>\n<p>UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Paul Alivisatos sent the following message to the campus community on Friday, March 13, 2020:</p>\n<p>We have decided to continue to offer instruction remotely via Zoom, teleconferencing and other virtual platforms for lecture, discussion, and seminar courses (as well as other types of courses such as laboratory, clinic, and studio courses, that have already successfully developed strategies for remote learning) through the end of the semester. We are doing this in response to guidance from public health authorities to implement social distancing in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Protecting the health and safety of members of the campus community remains our priority.</p>\n<p>More information Visit Berkeley’s coronavirus information page</p>\n<p>We also are committed to preserving our academic mission. We are working on solutions to offer alternative modes of instruction to more students in non-lecture courses and settings. For the small number of courses that do not have a remote option, students will need to get guidance from their instructors on how they are adopting social distancing practices, which ideally leaves six feet of space between individuals. More information to instructors is forthcoming today.</p>\n<p>We will support students and families in their decisions about where it is best for them to reside during this public health emergency. We recognize that some students may want or need to remain on campus through spring break or return to campus after spring break. They will be allowed to do so. It is possible we will close one or more of the residence halls and relocate students into fewer locations, as well as adjust our operations to improve social distancing (e.g., spreading students out, delivering box meals, scheduling use of common facilities, etc.). Students will receive relief from their campus housing and dining fees if they decide to move out. The campus will approve all requests for relief from further payment obligations of campus housing contracts from students who decide to move out of campus housing and Blackwell Hall for the remainder of this academic year. The campus will provide these students with a prorated refund of any campus housing fees that have already been paid by these students, based upon their effective move-out date. Students will have the choice to receive relief from payment obligations based upon an effective move-out date of April 1, April 10, or April 20. Students who want to move out must complete their written request and move out prior to April 20. The amount of the actual cash refund that a student receives after being released from the student’s campus housing payment obligations may be dependent upon the degree to which the student’s housing costs are covered by the student’s financial aid package. FAQS, further guidance, specific details, and online forms to complete to obtain housing refunds are being developed and will be published no later than Monday, March 16.</p>\n<p>Bowles Hall, International House (I-House), co-ops, fraternities and sororities, private apartments and other housing facilities not owned by the campus have their own housing policies. Please contact your building/house manager for details. In the event your current housing will close down and you do not have other options or would prefer to stay in Berkeley, please contact Cal Housing for assistance in securing a university housing contract.</p>\n<p>Depending on the guidance and direction of public health officials regarding COVID-19 in the coming weeks, it is possible that the campus may generally resume in-person instruction at some point during the semester. If in-person instruction resumes, in-person course attendance will continue to not be mandatory for the rest of the semester. Students who are able to make a decision now to finish this semester remotely are welcome to do so.</p>\n<p>We understand that some student workers may need their student-employee wages to cover their basic needs yet would prefer to leave campus and the local area. Supervisors are encouraged to explore work assignments that these students could perform remotely over a number of weeks. If such arrangements cannot be worked out, under UC systemwide policy, students may receive two weeks of paid administrative leave. Many students work a few hours a week, so such a leave could cover many weeks.</p>\n<p>Given the dynamic nature of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we advise students leaving campus for spring break that they take along any course materials they would need to keep up with classes that are being taught remotely from an off-campus location. We strongly advise students to refrain from non-essential travel during spring break.</p>\n<p>Despite this decision regarding instruction, critical campus functions, including our research enterprise and student support services, remain operational, some with adjusted service hours. We will rely on individual units to communicate any changes with your constituents. We have advised that managers and supervisors offer flexible work arrangements for employees when possible, yet we recognize that many of our operations require employees to be on campus.</p>\n<p>Currently there are no positive cases of COVID-19 related to any members of our campus community. Through the work of our dedicated University Health Services professionals and in close concert with local public health colleagues, we are monitoring the situation closely.</p>\n<p>Please take care of yourselves, do your part to “flatten the curve,” and slow the spread of COVID-19, respect those around you in accordance with our Principles of Community, stay up to date on COVID-19-related developments on campus, and be well.</p>","id":"4213bd78-08a1-5f05-b7ae-d6a404fbef1e","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-berkeley/2020-04-08-23_41_05/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"UC Berkeley extends remote instruction through end of semester"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sather-gate-750.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost A.

In response, the university is launching a new online video series, “Berkeley Conversations: COVID-19,” to connect our experts with the public and each other. Through Q&#x26;As, seminars, and panel discussions, faculty from a wide range of disciplines – from epidemiology to economics to the computing and data now undergirding their work – will share what they know, and what they are learning.</p>\n<p>We will offer open access to these forums every week through a new website, where it will be possible to watch live and archived conversations and consult a calendar that will list future events as they are scheduled.</p>\n<p>The series kicks off tomorrow, Friday, April 3, at 12:30 p.m., with a Q&#x26;A focused on how we can make sense of data and information about the virus’s spread, the impact and efficacy of social distancing and the implications for our short- and long-term futures. This first Berkeley Conversation will feature:</p>\n<p>Prof. Art. Reingold, M.D., the Division Head of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UC Berkeley School of Public Health. He has more than 40 years of experience in the prevention and control of infectious diseases at the national and global level.</p>\n<p>Associate Provost Jennifer Chayes, who leads the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society, and the School of Information.

This conversation is titled “Creating Informed Responses: Berkeley’s Computing and Data Science In Action.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, April 10, at a time to be determined, we will focus on the growing financial and economic impacts of the pandemic in this country and around the world. Faculty experts will help the audience understand possible outcomes and scenarios, the likely impact of governmental actions to date and what additional steps may be needed to address an array of extraordinary challenges posed by COVID-19.</p>\n<p>On Monday, April 13 from 4:30-6 p.m., UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health will host a follow-up to its initial town hall, “Coronavirus: Facts &#x26; Fears.” An archived version of that event can be found here. Part Two of this series, “Coronavirus: Science and Solutions,” will focus on addressing unanswered questions from the last town hall, and highlighting emerging science that will drive solutions to this and future pandemic outbreaks.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the next several weeks, Berkeley Conversations will present faculty experts who will address a range of pressing issues, questions and concerns regarding timely research subjects including:</p>\n<p>Epidemiological and economic developments as they unfold</p>\n<p>Public Policy: Equity and disparities in the age of COVID-19</p>\n<p>Child Psychology: Caring for kids in trying times</p>\n<p>Health and Wellness: Maintaining and sustaining personal well-being</p>\n<p>Biomedicine: New frontiers, tactics and strategies</p>\n<p>Sociology: What are we witnessing now in society, and what might the world look like once the crisis passes</p>\n<p>History: What can we learn from past epidemics and global crises</p>\n<p>Data and Privacy: How to protect personal freedom in an era of extraordinary governmental monitoring and interventions</p>\n<p>Cultural Studies: Racism, xenophobia and COVID-19</p>\n<p>Statistics: Understanding analysis and recognizing bias in news</p>\n<p>Engineering: How can sensor technologies help avert future healthcare crises</p>\n<p>Business: Long-term impacts of COVID-19 on how we engage at the office and at home</p>\n<p>The Arts: How can creative and performing arts contribute in the age of COVID-19</p>\n<p>We will provide updated information as new events are scheduled.

We have heard from faculty, students and deans' offices about examples of the challenges you are facing: students taking on the role of primary caregiver for siblings, students without internet access, students dealing with sudden economic stress due to family job losses and more. We know this is a very difficult time for students and we want to support their efforts to continue making progress toward their Binghamton University degrees, so we have implemented the following policies for the spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pass/Fail policy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For spring 2020, the following Pass/Fail policy will apply for all Binghamton University undergraduates except for those in academic programs where licensure or accreditation regulations prohibit (nursing and social work).</p>\n<p>These changes affect only Binghamton University degree programs; your decision to select the P/F grade option may affect future applications to medical school and other graduate or professional programs. Students who are considering applying to such programs should consult their advising office for guidance.</p>\n<p>These are the basic details for those in academic programs without licensure or accreditation restrictions:</p>\n<p>Up to 12 credits may be taken with a P/F grade option in spring 2020 and used to satisfy degree requirements, including major/minor/General Education requirements, even if these 12 credits would cause a student to exceed their school/college’s cumulative P/F credit limit. (Students may take more than 12 credits for P/F and credit toward their degree if these additional credits do not cause them to exceed the cumulative P/F credit limit for their school/college. Refer to your college’s advising page for your specific limits.)</p>\n<p>Students can decide whether to choose the P/F grading option after spring 2020 grades have been assigned. To give advising offices a chance to help each student make the decision that is best for them, the grade change option will be turned on after spring 2020 grades have been assigned.</p>\n<p>Students will continue to have the option to receive a letter grade if they choose to do so. All undergraduate courses, except those in licensure-qualifying or accreditation-limited programs, will have the P/F grade option even if the P/F grade option was not originally offered for the course.</p>\n<p>A grade of “P” will satisfy progression requirements in prerequisite courses.</p>\n<p>Many students will benefit most by electing to take only a few or even no courses with the P/F option. This policy allows students to wait until after grades have been assigned before deciding whether to choose the P/F grade option.</p>\n<p>Follow the links below to find your school’s specific advice:</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>University Semester Withdrawal policy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For spring 2020, the University Withdrawal deadline will be June 5.

The entire campus mourns for him. Our sympathies go out to his friends and family, as well as to his classmates and peers. A suspect is in custody. I thank our Binghamton University Police, New York State Police and the Broome County District Attorney's office for their quick work in apprehending the individual as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>As president, my top priority is keeping everyone in our campus community safe. I want to reaffirm to you Binghamton University's commitment to providing a safe learning environment.

The entire campus mourns for him. Our sympathies go out to his friends and family, as well as to his classmates and peers. A suspect is in custody. I thank our Binghamton University Police, New York State Police and the Broome County District Attorney's office for their quick work in apprehending the individual as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>As president, my top priority is keeping everyone in our campus community safe. I want to reaffirm to you Binghamton University's commitment to providing a safe learning environment. Unfortunately, we live in a time where violence is part of society, and, as a campus of 17,000+ students and several thousand faculty and staff, there are occasions where violence will intrude on our campus. We will continue to focus on keeping ours a safe campus, with a fully-empowered state law enforcement agency that works closely with the residential communities to protect life and property.</p>\n<p>Part of fostering a safe campus involves quick, clear communication with the community. Over the past 18 hours we've sent a number of messages alerting parents, students and faculty and staff. However, to get the alerts, faculty and staff need to sign up for the service by going to <a href=\"https://www.getrave.com/login/binghamton\">https://www.getrave.com/login/binghamton</a> and logging in or going to BU BRAIN in <a href=\"http://my.binghamton.edu\">http://my.binghamton.edu</a> to update B-Alert contact information.

As previously stated, law enforcement believes the attack was not a random act and that the victim was targeted. University Police have the support of other law enforcement agencies that are currently on campus assisting with the investigation and with other law enforcement responsibilities. If there is any specific action that law enforcement believes people on campus should take in the interest of their safety, the University will communicate that information via the campus alert system and on the binghamton.edu/alert page. We anticipate a return to our normal schedule of classes tomorrow, April 17.</p>\n<p>We have always offered safety advice to students living on and off campus. In reminder of those precautions – our residence halls are always locked and only residents of that building have key card access. Do not allow someone unknown to you to follow or tailgate you in. If that happens, report it to hall staff on duty or police.</p>\n<p>In addition:</p>\n<p>• Keep your Binghamton ID with you at all times. If your ID is lost, it should be immediately reported to University Police.</p>\n<p>• Keep doors to your room and/or suite locked and do not share room combination/key information.</p>\n<p>• Register for the Binghamton Alert System at <a href=\"https://www.getrave.com/login/binghamton\">https://www.getrave.com/login/binghamton</a> or at BU BRAIN to receive emails and/or text messages about critical campus information and emergencies.

In response to the disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, Binghamton University’s Graduate School is adopting temporary changes to its academic policies to minimize the impact of the disruption on our graduate students.</p>\n<p>Policy on S/U grades</p>\n<p>For spring 2020, the Graduate School’s policy with respect to the S/U grade option is waived except for those academic programs where licensure or accreditation regulations would prohibit the waiver of this policy. Specifically, the S/U policy change DOES NOT apply to nursing; pharmacy; clinical psychology; and programs in Teaching, Learning and Educational Leadership.</p>\n<p>All students should consult with their graduate program director to determine whether taking a course S/U will result in adverse consequences. These changes affect only Binghamton University graduate degree programs; graduate students who plan to apply to another graduate program after completing their current program should consider how the decision to select the S/U grade option may affect future applications to such programs.</p>\n<p>Grades will be assigned normally at the end of the spring 2020 semester. After students see their grades, they will be able to change to an S/U grading option if they would like to do so. The deadline to request a change in grade option to S/U will be June 5. With the exceptions noted above, graduate students may change to an S/U grade option for any course they are currently enrolled in during the spring 2020 semester and a grade of S will fulfill progression and degree requirements accordingly. Correspondingly, S/U courses taken in spring 2020 will count toward residency and degree completion requirements.</p>\n<p>S/U-graded courses do not count toward GPA calculation. Students who need to raise their GPA above the threshold required for graduation (i.e., 3.0) must therefore take this into account in their decision making.</p>\n<p>Continuous Registration Policy for graduating students</p>\n<p>For summer 2020, the Graduate School’s continuous registration policy has been modified. For students who need to be enrolled for one credit hour to complete their degrees in summer of 2020, and who therefore must maintain continuous registration, the University will absorb the cost of one credit hour of tuition upon petition. To make the request, students who are planning to complete their degrees must submit a general petition form to the Graduate School requesting tuition support for the one credit hour necessary to maintain continuous registration.</p>\n<p>Eligibility for funding for the 2020-21 academic year</p>\n<p>The Graduate School will waive the requirement that students have no incompletes or withdrawals on their transcript for the spring semester to remain eligible for funding in the 2020-21 academic year.</p>\n<p>Policy on Grade Point Average (GPA)</p>\n<p>Graduate students must have a grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 to receive their graduate degree. The GPA requirement will not be adjusted and S/U courses do not count toward GPA calculation.</p>\n<p>Degree completion and conferral</p>\n<p>Degree completion deadlines and degree conferral for spring 2020 will remain unchanged. Students who have been negatively affected by COVID-19 and cannot meet spring 2020 graduation deadlines may submit a general petition form to grad@binghamton.edu for a summer 2020 continuous registration waiver.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Donald Nieman</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>\n<p>For more information and updates, continue to visit the University's COVID-19 website.</p>","id":"a5e58cf5-ab94-59d1-a819-b2d186208e24","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-binghamton/2020-04-10-14_02_09/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A message from Provost Donald Neiman on Graduate Student Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) and other policies for spring 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>New credit/No credit option for graduate students Spring 2020</p>\n<p>March 31, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Brandeis Graduate Students,</p>\n<p>I want to acknowledge again the significant disruption to your Brandeis experience with the rapid move from in-person to online teaching along with the closure of the library and research labs in the past weeks. The Deans of the graduate schools in Arts and Sciences, the Heller School for Social Policy and Management, and the International Business School have made a set of recommendations to introduce flexibility and options for graduate students in their schools with respect to grades for Spring 2020. After review and approval by the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies the following new policies will be put into effect for this semester in response to the COVID-19 disruption:</p>\n<p>Graduate students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and Ph.D. students in the International Business School may elect to cover any number of grades from Spring 2020 that are a B- or higher with a CR once they have seen their grade in a particular course: CR would cover B- or higher and NC for anything lower. If a GSAS student elects to take the CR/NC option for a required course, we strongly encourage programs in GSAS to allow the course with a CR grade to satisfy the program requirements.</p>\n<p>Masters students in the Heller School for Social Policy and Management and the International Business School may elect to cover any number of grades from Spring 2020 that are a C+ or higher with a CR once they have seen their grade in a particular course: CR would cover C+ or higher and NC for anything lower. Spring 2020 C+ or CR grades will not count toward the maximum number of C+ grades during their particular program and will be accepted for credit. CR or C+ grades for Spring 2020 will be allowed to fulfill any program or concentration requirement and will be allowed to double count for requirements as a regularly graded course would. Consistent with current policy, grades below a “C+” will be considered as unsatisfactory and will not be counted as credit for degree requirements.</p>\n<p>The deadlines for covering a Spring 2020 grade with a CR are May 13th for graduating students; August 21st for students graduating in August; and October 15th for all other graduate students. Once a Spring 2020 grade has been posted, students may email registrar@brandeis.edu to request the grade be covered with a CR or NC.</p>\n<p>These policy changes for Brandeis graduate students are effective for Spring semester 2020 only. Please contact your Dean and faculty within your school for further details and questions you may have about these new policies.</p>\n<p>As we each struggle to find some equilibrium in this unprecedented time I urge you to continue to virtually connect with your classmates and faculty both in your online-classes and “outside”. As we enter another week of social distancing, with more weeks likely to come, it is more important than ever to find new ways to connect and support each other.</p>\n<p>All the very best,</p>\n<p>Lisa</p>\n<p>Lisa M.

In order to assist all efforts underway to maintain the health and safety of all who would be involved in a gathering of more than 7,000 individuals, and based on public health experts here and at the Centers for Disease Control, we are canceling our traditional on-campus ceremonies and Commencement weekend.</p>\n<p>As disappointing as I know this is to everyone, this difficult decision is the responsible thing to do as families need to plan their travel and accommodations, and there remains uncertainty about just when Covid-19 will plateau and recede here and across the country.

We have been inspired by instructors who have already transformed their courses into remote learning communities, and moved by students helping teach their instructors and peers about resources that will enable us to remain connected as a teaching and learning community in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>After extensive discussion, we are writing to share a comprehensive set of Temporary Academic Policies for the College and Graduate School to help support our transition to remote teaching and learning, which begins with the resumption of the spring semester on March 30. These policies have been developed in consultation with students, staff, faculty and administrators, and we are thankful to all who contributed their ideas and time to this important effort. We are especially grateful to the Faculty Executive Committee as well as those members of the College Curriculum Council, Graduate Council, and Undergraduate Council of Students, who spent hours reviewing these policies and providing their feedback over the past few days.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage all instructors and students to carefully review the Temporary Academic Policies for Spring 2020 now posted on the Teaching &#x26; Learning section of Brown’s COVID-19 website. The policies include detailed information regarding:</p>\n<p>guidance to prioritize asynchronous instruction that enables student access at any time;</p>\n<p>requirements to hold any synchronous class meetings during scheduled class times and to record synchronous sessions for equity and accessibility;</p>\n<p>guidance on final examinations and alternative assessments;</p>\n<p>guidelines for holding remote dissertation and thesis defenses;</p>\n<p>maintenance of important deadlines for degree clearance and graduation;</p>\n<p>opportunities for both instructor and student changes to grade options; and</p>\n<p>postponement of fall pre-registration and concentration declaration deadlines</p>\n<p>These policies are intended to honor both the spirit and letter of Brown’s distinctive approach to higher education. Wherever possible, our goal continues to be to provide both students and instructors with the flexibility and structure to make informed choices, because we have confidence in your ability to work together to support shared learning. Our guiding principles remain three-fold: (1) to empower instructors to make adjustments to course plans to help students meet their course's key learning goals; (2) to reaffirm and support Brown’s commitment to full inclusion for all students, especially considering the varying access to technology and experience with remote learning among students and instructors; and (3) to promote patience and generosity during this unprecedented moment, which has become a learning opportunity for all learners and teachers.</p>\n<p>For instructors, these policies mean you will have an opportunity to revise your course plans, petition to shift to mandatory S/NC grading in exceptional circumstances, and reconsider your final examinations. We also ask that you share updated syllabi by April 3, record online class meetings, and continue to hold remote office hours. For students, this means that you will be able to reconsider your course grade options in mid-April, postpone concentration declaration, and pre-register in June – and that we will support you in finishing your coursework, dissertations and theses on time this semester. Finally, as a reminder to all, please note that these temporary policies are supplemental to all other applicable University policies, including the Academic Code and Code of Student Conduct that remain in effect during this period of remote learning.</p>\n<p>We thank the entire Brown community for your patience as we have developed these policies. As remote instruction begins, we encourage you to take advantage of the many Teaching and Learning Resources available to both students and instructors. If you have questions, please feel free to reach out to us directly at [email protected] and [email protected].</p>\n<p>We and our colleagues across the University are here to support you as we all embark on this new experience of fully remote education at Brown.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Andrew G.

As we’re all aware, the country and the world are in the grips of an international health crisis that is creating hardship and loss for numerous communities and families. I hope that you and those you love continue to be healthy and safe.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly clear that the global coronavirus pandemic will not end soon. The most optimistic epidemiological forecasts available suggest that the virus will peak in late April or early May. Even if this is accurate, it will take additional weeks and maybe months for daily life to return fully to normal.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, I informed our students that we would decide no later than March 27 whether Commencement and Reunion Weekend could be held in May. Given the current projections, it is already clear that the ceremony and activities must be postponed. It saddens me that our community will not be together for this important milestone this spring, but I hope it can be held as early as October 2020 (although it remains too early to make a final decision).</p>\n<p>We will keep our students, families and alumni community informed about the date as soon as it can be set, and we will do all we can to support new graduates who may need financial support to get back to campus.</p>\n<p>It is important to me that we hold Commencement and Reunion as a community together, as we always do. When I talk to Brown alumni about the single most memorable experience of their Commencement celebrations, they recall walking through the Van Wickle Gates and down the hill, with throngs of alumni, faculty and administrators lining the streets and applauding the new graduates. All of our 2020 graduating students deserve to have this tremendous experience.</p>\n<p>Of course, for our students who are completing degree requirements this semester, you will formally receive your degrees and become Brown graduates at the usual time. We are planning a virtual Degree Conferral Ceremony that will take place over Memorial Day Weekend. We will send details in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>I am so sorry to write with such disappointing news, especially during a stressful and difficult time for all of us. I hope the entire campus community joins me in looking forward to the resumption of classes next week, which I hope will bring some normalcy to all of our lives.</p>\n<p>As we prepare to resume classes, Brown remains the resilient and collaborative community that prioritizes our students’ well-being and academic success. Let’s learn together, support each other, and be there for one another. Let’s do all the things that make our community special at Brown.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Christina H.

These discussions have made clear that my recent email regarding Brown’s grading policies created many more questions than it resolved. These are difficult moments, and I understand that no single message or policy can address the range of challenges and the scope of uncertainty that members of our community are facing right now.</p>\n<p>In light of the questions and suggestions that many of you raised, I am writing to share two specific updates regarding Brown’s policies on grading and academic standing that were made after careful consultation with faculty, staff, and students as well as the relevant governing academic committees.</p>\n<p>First, in order to provide students with more time and opportunity to consider their grade options this semester, Brown will extend the grade option deadline through the last full week of instruction. All students will now have from Monday, April 13 until Friday, May 1 to decide whether they want to receive letter or S/NC grades for all courses that are not mandatory S/NC. We hope that this extension of the grade option deadline will provide you with the opportunity to make the best possible decisions for your individual circumstances.</p>\n<p>Second, in order to promote academic continuity, the Committee on Academic Standing has established guidelines to assure that no student’s academic standing will be adversely affected by their coursework this Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>For decades, Brown’s academic policies have promoted individualized student learning through principles defined by choice and purpose, and we continue to believe that these are also the most flexible and supportive policies for this moment.</p>\n<p>We are grateful that our community is sustained by the network of trust, support, and partnership that connects us all, whether across campus or around the world. Please continue to reach out to us at [email protected] if we can be of help or support in any way.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Rashid Zia</p>\n<p>Dean of the College</p>","id":"933816e6-beb2-5f84-9891-1eb86c72d985","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-brown/2020-04-10-14_06_21/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"To Brown Students: Extending the S/NC Deadline, and Guidelines for Academic Standing"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://covid.brown.edu/themes/custom/brown/static/apple-touch-icon.png\"></p>\n<p>Dear PhD Students,</p>\n<p>Our community is facing challenges unlike any we have seen before as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

While we know our community will rise to the evolving challenges we all are facing, it’s clear that this health crisis will continue to have significant impacts on graduate education for many semesters. We feel it’s important to outline the actions Brown is taking to support graduate students.</p>\n<p>As President Paxson’s April 6 message underscored, we are guided by core principles during this highly fluid period, including supporting students with the greatest financial need and taking steps to ensure that all students are able to continue with their educational programs. Graduate students are central to Brown’s mission, and the University will offer support to graduate students who may need extended time to complete their degrees, in addition to implementing the following initiatives to address both immediate and longer-term needs:</p>\n<p>COVID-19 Emergency Funding: The University has established a new Graduate School COVID-19 Emergency Fund to support students facing immediate financial hardships. The application for these funds has been available in UFunds since March 30.</p>\n<p>Enhanced Summer Funding and Professionalization Opportunities: The University is developing teaching, professional development, proctorship, and other competitive opportunities to enable PhD students to earn additional summer funding. These positions will be targeted to those students with reduced summer funding, and students will work to support remote instruction for pre-college and undergraduate courses. Applications for summer positions will be available under “Graduate School COVID-19 Summer Positions” in UFunds.</p>\n<p>Extended Time for Students with Disrupted Research/Progress: Beginning fall 2020, PhD students will be eligible to apply for an additional semester of stipend support to compensate for time lost due to COVID-19. Applications will be available under “Graduate School COVID-19 Extended Time” in UFunds. For students potentially needing extended time as early as this summer, please contact your DGS who will review with the Graduate School.</p>\n<p>Teaching Opportunities for Recent Graduates: Recent PhD graduates will be eligible to apply for a limited number of postdoctoral teaching fellowships through an expansion and modification of the Deans’ Faculty Fellows program.</p>\n<p>Extended Health Insurance Coverage for Recent Graduates: All PhD students graduating this May will also be able to apply for University support for an extension of their student health insurance coverage. The coverage would extend current coverage beyond August 15, 2020, for up to three months. Students will be asked to submit a Request for Extended Coverage Form by July 1 (by emailing [email protected] ).</p>\n<p>In addition to these initiatives, we are aware that there are added concerns — related to visa and compliance, tax support, and travel restrictions, among others — facing our international graduate students. The Graduate School and Global Brown teams are working directly with this community to address these issues.</p>\n<p>We look forward to communicating with you the further details about these initiatives in the coming weeks. Many of these plans will require planning and collaboration with your graduate programs and with other offices and staff across campus. The variances in graduate programs' duration, curricula and support mechanisms are complex, and we therefore ask for your patience as we coordinate our responses to the needs of the community at this time. We will continue to explore additional opportunities, including for recent graduates.</p>\n<p>We know that in addition to the academic and daily disruptions of our lives, many in our community are being impacted personally by the global pandemic.

At BU, the need to transition all of this semester’s courses to remote teaching has presented our faculty, students, and staff with myriad challenges. I have been both impressed with and moved by how well our faculty, students, and staff have adapted to these challenging circumstances, and want to commend all of you for your patience, understanding, and fortitude over the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>In recognition of the disruptive, stressful, and unconventional way in which this semester has unfolded, Boston University will adopt a special set of grading policies for undergraduate, graduate, and non-degree students for the spring 2020 semester. These grading policies have been developed in consultation with the academic deans who gathered input from their faculty, and with the Faculty Council. Three schools with unique disciplinary and accreditation constraints – the Goldman School of Dental Medicine, the School of Law, and the School of Medicine – have developed grading policies that are specific to their schools; these are listed below.</p>\n<p>Undergraduate Students</p>\n<p>All undergraduate students at Boston University, regardless of their school or college, will be assigned a letter grade by faculty in each of their classes upon completion of their coursework. After receiving their letter grades, students will have the option to designate any, all, or none of their courses taken in spring 2020 as “Credit/No Credit” classes. Students can also choose to retain their letter grade for any or all of their courses. If a student chooses to designate a course as Credit/No Credit, their transcript will simply show “CR (Credit)” or “NC (No Credit)” for that course in the place of the letter grade. For undergraduate courses, any grade of D or above will translate into a “Credit” designation.</p>\n<p>The Credit/No Credit option is a unique designation to be used for the spring 2020 semester only and differs from our normal Pass/Fail option in two significant ways. First, unlike Pass/Fail, students can utilize the Credit/No Credit designation in any course, including those that are needed to fulfill major, minor, and Hub requirements; for the spring 2020 semester, a grade of CR in an applicable course will satisfy major, minor and Hub requirements. Credits earned with a CR designation will be counted towards the total number of credits required to graduate. Second, a designation of Credit/No Credit will not impact a student’s GPA. Students who are on academic probation are eligible to use the Credit/No Credit option.</p>\n<p>The process through which students will indicate their selection of Credit/No Credit is still being developed. Students willnot be asked to make this decision until after they have seen their letter grades in May and have had an opportunity to consult with advisors. Thus, students do not need to take any action at this point in time. Detailed instructions will be sent via email later this spring, before April 30, 2020.</p>\n<p>This policy does not apply to courses that are, under regular circumstances, graded as Pass/Fail. Courses that are now Pass/Fail will continue to be graded on a Pass/Fail basis and will be reflected as such on transcripts. The policy also does not apply to courses that were completed prior to spring break, or to students who previously decided to audit a class. Students from other institutions who are studying at BU through cross-registration programs should consult with their home institution regarding their grading requirements.</p>\n<p>Graduate and Professional Students</p>\n<p>Graduate and professional students in all schools and colleges, except for the three listed below, and including those enrolled in online and off-campus programs, will have the option to elect Credit/No Credit for any of their classes this semester. Schools that have their own registrar and unique disciplinary and accreditation constraints – the Goldman School of Dental Medicine, the School of Law, and the School of Medicine – developed and will implement the school-specific policies summarized below. Students in these three schools will receive additional details from their deans shortly.</p>\n<p>Graduate and professional students in all other schools may utilize the policy described above for undergraduate students with one distinction: schools and colleges with graduate and professional programs may set their own thresholds for the minimum letter grade required to receive “Credit” in graduate and professional courses. Deans will communicate with their respective graduate and professional students to clarify what letter grade is required to receive Credit in specific courses and programs.</p>\n<p>Goldman School of Dental Medicine For the spring 2020 semester, GSDM will continue to use its existing letter grade format based on criteria previously established by individual course syllabi. There will be no change in the grading process for didactic courses, while grades for preclinical (hands-on simulation/technique courses) and clinical (direct patient care or clinical demonstrations) courses will be based on a percentage of the planned coursework.</p>\n<p>School of Law All spring semester JD courses will be graded on a Pass/Fail basis. LLM students will have the option of electing Pass/Fail for any and all classes after they have seen their grade in each course. Neither the mandatory Pass/Fail credits for JDs nor the elected Pass/Fail credits for LLMs and other non-JD students during the spring 2020 semester will count toward the maximum ungraded credits allowed in each program.</p>\n<p>School of Medicine</p>\n<p>Our hope is that these spring 2020 semester grading policies will provide some relief for students who are enduring an unexpectedly difficult semester. We also recognize that many students have worked very hard this semester and want to have that effort reflected on their transcripts. By giving undergraduate and most graduate students the ability to choose whether or not to utilize the Credit/No Credit option for any or all of their courses, we hope to both reduce stress among those who are struggling to adjust to remote learning, and allow those who wish to retain some or all of their letter grades the ability to do so.</p>\n<p>I appreciate your patience and understanding as we have developed and vetted this important set of policies. I also want to express gratitude to the faculty and staff who have done an extraordinary job rapidly adjusting to remote teaching and advising in an undoubtedly less-than-ideal situation. Your continued dedication to your students is apparent and very much appreciated.</p>\n<p>University Grading Policies for Spring Semester 2020 – 3.27.20</p>\n<p>View all posts</p>","id":"03d5d827-7be1-5bbd-880a-ff750c8a0fa3","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-bu/2020-04-08-23_21_07/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"University Grading Policies for Spring Semester 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.bu.edu/provost/wp-content/themes/responsive-framework-2-x/icons/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\"></p>\n<p>Campus Response to Governor Baker’s March 23 Order</p>\n<p>From Dr. Jean Morrison, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer</p>\n<p>and Gary Nicksa, Senior Vice President for Operations</p>\n<p>This morning, Governor Baker issued an order temporarily closing non-essential businesses and organizations starting at noon on March 24 and prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people, and directed the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to issue a “Stay at Home” advisory for the next two weeks.</p>\n<p>Universities and colleges have been categorized as “essential services” within this order, meaning that the order will not directly impact our current plans to provide remote teaching to all students and essential support functions to those students who remain on our campuses. While all faculty are encouraged to work from home where possible, those who choose to come to campus to conduct their remote teaching are still allowed to do so under the Governor’s new order. We continue to ask supervisors to work with their staff to enable faculty to either work from home or conduct their classes from their academic buildings.</p>\n<p>Boston University research laboratories should stop normal operations and shift to basic maintenance only, ensuring safety and preserving future capabilities, other than COVID-19 research and essential biomedical research that cannot be stopped at this time.Only critical maintenance procedures that require regular attention in order to maintain laboratory viability should continue. For example, cell, plant, or animal colony maintenance, shared computational equipment maintenance, and maintenance of equipment that requires gas or cryogen monitoring/service, such as freezers, electron microscopes, mass spectrometers, and incubators can be performed. Any research operations that are deemed critical to continue, such as those listed above, must obtain proper approvals using this form and as previously outlined by Gloria Waters, Vice President and Associate Provost for Research. Access to labs will be limited to personnel approved to perform these essential procedures and processes. The Animal Science Center will continue to provide daily animal maintenance (feed, water, ensure clean/dry caging, etc.) and Environmental Health &#x26; Safety staff will continue to be on-site.</p>\n<p>The University’s administrative offices remain open to support remote education, critical research, and student services. As most staff have transitioned to working remotely, only academic and administrative personnel whose jobs require them to be on campus are being asked to commute. While the University’s public safety officials believe a Boston University identification card will be sufficient to identify faculty and staff as essential employees, those who continue to come to campus may wish to carry this “Essential Employee Designation Letter” to supplement their ID card.</p>\n<p>Finally, as was announced in BU Today this morning, due to the decreasing number of faculty and staff working on campus, the University has begun securing campus buildings to ensure the safety of those who are on campus. Faculty, staff, and students with key or card access to buildings and interior spaces will have normal access to those spaces.</p>\n<p>Campus Response to Governor Baker’s March 23 Order – 3.23.20</p>\n<p>View all posts</p>","id":"95c362b8-88f0-5660-8e7b-9142b80e9fed","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-bu/2020-04-08-23_21_10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Campus Response to Governor Baker’s March 23 Order"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"http://www.bu.edu/provost/wp-content/themes/responsive-framework-2-x/icons/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\"></p>\n<p>Remote Teaching Readiness Plan</p>\n<p>From Dr. Jean Morrison, University Provost and Chief Academic Officer</p>\n<p>We continue to pay close attention to developments around COVID-19 and its potential impact on Boston University. In order to prepare for the possibility that classes may be unable to meet in-person, I have asked Chris Dellarocas, Associate Provost for Digital Learning &#x26; Innovation, to lead the implementation of a Remote Teaching Readiness Plan. This plan is designed to prepare and equip faculty to continue to deliver undergraduate and graduate course content if the University were required to cease in-person classes for some period of time.</p>\n<p>If the University were required to close or otherwise cease all in-person meetings, it is our expectation that faculty will find the best approach to continue offering course content.</p>\n<p>The goal of the readiness plan is twofold: 1) ensure awareness of the core technological tools we have in place for remote teaching, and 2) ensure that each school and college has the resources and knowledge required to support faculty in using these tools, and potentially other supplemental tools identified at the school/college or program level, in the event of a full campus closure. I know that some of you are already offering course content remotely; for those of you already doing this, please feel free to utilize the additional support described below.</p>\n<p>Baseline remote teaching in case of an emergency campus closure should consist of faculty using Blackboard (or Sakai, in the case of Questrom) to host their course materials and receive student work, and using Zoom for remote synchronous class sessions. Zoom can also be used to hold qualifying examination sessions for PhD students and for dissertation defenses, if necessary. Information about these and other resources is available on the IS&#x26;T website. This site provides a wealth of information about working and teaching remotely.</p>\n<p>Every school and college has designated one or more individuals to serve as their Remote Teaching Coordinators (RTCs). The list of RTCs is included at the end of this memo. In the event of a campus closure, faculty would be instructed to contact their school or college’s RTC with any questions about remote teaching tools and capability. Boston University’s Information Services &#x26; Technology(IS&#x26;T), Educational Technologies (EdTech) group, and Center for Teaching &#x26; Learning (CTL) will offer secondary support to RTCs to ensure that all faculty receive adequate and timely support.</p>\n<p>The Education Technologies group is offering daily training sessions for faculty during spring break week on Blackboard, Sakai, and Zoom. These trainings will also be recorded and made available for on-demand review. We encourage all faculty to participate in a training at their earliest convenience. If this is your first experience with these technologies, I would encourage you to work with your RTC to test your deployment of the technology. In addition, IS&#x26;T staff are working to create Blackboard sites for any courses that do not currently have a presence on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure that faculty have the necessary basic technology resources for remote teaching, we will send a short Digital Resiliency Survey to all faculty this afternoon. Please watch for a survey email from provost@bu.edu and complete the survey from your remote teaching location.</p>\n<p>In summary, we are asking faculty to:</p>\n<p>Fill out the IS&#x26;T Digital Resiliency Survey from your remote teaching location Attend an EdTech training session, if needed, on Blackboard/Zoom at your earliest convenience Contact your school or college’s RTC for assistance with any questions on technology or adapting your teaching. Your RTC will send out communications regarding the suggested steps to prepare your courses for remote teaching.</p>\n<p>Now is the time to begin preparing for how you would plan to deliver your course material and assessments through the remainder of the semester if a closure occurs. We also ask you to be flexible throughout this emerging situation, particularly with students who might have to miss some class time due to travel or health challenges.</p>\n<p>I want to thank everyone who has agreed to serve as a Remote Teaching Coordinator for their willingness to take on this additional responsibility. I am also grateful to all of you for your understanding as we develop this new institutional process and for your continued support for our students and other community members during this time of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>School and College Remote Teaching Coordinators</p>\n<p>College of Arts &#x26; Sciences</p>\n<p>Dan Rabinowitz, Educational Technologist – cashelp@bu.edu</p>\n<p>College of Communication</p>\n<p>Brad Fernandes, Director of Technology – bradfern@bu.edu</p>\n<p>Dustin Supa, Senior Associate Dean and Associate Professor of Public Relations – supa@bu.edu</p>\n<p>College of Engineering</p>\n<p>Bryan Batista, Director of Technology and Systems – batista@bu.edu</p>\n<p>College of Fine Arts</p>\n<p>Rebekah Pierson, Associate Dean of Graduate Affairs – lambo@bu.edu</p>\n<p>College of General Studies</p>\n<p>Megan Sullivan, Associate Dean for Faculty Research &#x26; Development and Associate Professor of Rhetoric – msullvan@bu.edu</p>\n<p>Tom McLaughlin, Client Technology Analyst – tompm@bu.edu</p>\n<p>College of Health &#x26; Rehabilitation Sciences: Sargent College</p>\n<p>Karen Jacobs, Associate Dean for Digital Learning &#x26; Innovation and Clinical Professor – kjacobs@bu.edu</p>\n<p>Frederick S.

All of us hope to return to in-person classes and on-campus activity as soon as possible, but we must continue to prioritize the health and safety of our community. Unfortunately, it has become clear that the restrictions resulting from the pandemic will continue for some time. Governor Baker announced that the Massachusetts stay-at-home advisory has been extended through May 4, 2020. Moreover, public health experts in our community believe that the recovery is likely to be protracted and we must, therefore, be measured in our actions to return our academic community to normal operations.</p>\n<p>With this information in mind, we have made a number of decisions about programs scheduled for summer 2020. As you will read below, we are moving to cancel all in-person classes and other academic activities on the Charles River and Medical Campuses, except as listed below, and to offer Summer Session 1 and 2 classes remotely. Deposits will be refunded for all cancelled programs.</p>\n<p>Although this decision will be disappointing to many, we believe it is necessary to achieve our ultimate goal: to return our students, staff, and faculty in the fall to our residential campus community and resume the quality in-person programs that are our hallmark as a leading private research university. By making these decisions now, we give our faculty time to optimize the remote delivery of our courses during the summer. We also give our staff time to reopen our campus in the fall and to establish the protocols that will ensure the safety of our community.</p>\n<p>Here are the decisions we are announcing today:</p>\n<p>Both Summer Terms at Boston University, Session 1 (May 20–July 1, 2020) and Session 2 (July 6–August 14, 2020), will occur only through remote engagement. No in-person courses or programs will be offered during this time period. This policy applies to all Boston University Summer Term programs, including those scheduled to take place on the Charles River and Medical Campuses. Programs for our students in the Medical Doctor, Physician Assistant, and the Doctor of Dental Medicine are not covered by this decision. The timing for these programs will be communicated in the future. Summer Term leadership will work with faculty to determine which scheduled summer courses can be administered remotely. Departments with other programs planned for this time period should decide whether or not the programs can be conducted remotely and communicate with participants accordingly. Boston University employees will be able to use tuition remission toward Summer Session 1 and 2 courses that normally would have met face-to-face and have now moved to remote teaching and learning.</p>\n<p>The College of General Studies Summer Session 1 and 2 Boston–London and Boston–New England programs will not take place in person. We are exploring ways to make up for these missed experiences. Natalie McKnight, Dean of the College of General Studies, will be in touch with the CGS community to share additional details about the summer programming.</p>\n<p>All international Boston University Study Abroad programs for Summer 2020 will be cancelled. Further, all US-based Study Abroad programs (New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC) scheduled for the summer have also been cancelled. Please contact Study Abroad directly at abroad@bu.edu with any questions.</p>\n<p>All other K–12 Summer 2020 programs on our Boston campuses and elsewhere are also cancelled. This includes cancelling the Boston University Tanglewood Institute (BUTI). Please check with program leadership for further details.</p>\n<p>This includes cancelling the Boston University Tanglewood Institute (BUTI). Please check with program leadership for further details.

Our approach includes ensuring that decisions we make do not jeopardize any student's financial aid.

A calculated credit amount is being determined for each of these fees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transportation fee</li>\n<li>Athletics fee</li>\n<li>Recreation</li>\n<li>Campus Life Fee</li>\n<li>Student Activity Fee - to be determined by the applicable student government.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After these credits are applied to the student's account, a refund will be granted as applicable.

However, we realize that the effort to transition to remote instruction – as well as limited access to labs, archives, studios, and field and clinical locations – have disrupted faculty, postdoctoral, and graduate student research and scholarship. In addition, the COVID-19 situation is posing unique challenges and causing anxiety for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars who are preparing to enter a disrupted job market.</p>\n<p>As a public research university, it is important that UB focus attention on the challenges that our faculty, research staff, postdocs, and graduate students are experiencing as a result of the COVID-19 disruption. To that end, I am forming a Research and Graduate Education Task Force, which will be led by Vice President for Research and Economic Development Venu Govindaraju and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Graduate School Graham Hammill. This task force will be charged with delivering recommendations by May 8, 2020 on issues that include:</p>\n<p>Ensuring that research and scholarship across the university continues to the greatest extent possible while safeguarding the health of the campus community</p>\n<p>Understanding the impacts on maintaining laboratory research if we experience a prolonged restriction to research facilities</p>\n<p>Sustaining future research and scholarship opportunities by facilitating and helping faculty maintain successful grant and fellowship applications</p>\n<p>Preparing TAs to balance instruction in this new environment with the need to maintain progress on their research and dissertations</p>\n<p>Considering opportunities for maintaining retention and completion in graduate degree programs</p>\n<p>Understanding and mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 situation on the future careers of graduate students and postdocs when there are likely to be hiring pauses across the economy, including in higher education</p>\n<p>Understanding the unique needs of international students and providing accommodations to the best of our ability</p>\n<p>Now more than ever, it is critical for faculty, postdocs and graduate students to utilize available technology to maintain close working relationships so that, as a campus community, we can continue the significant progress we have made in increasing grant applications, scholarly productivity, clinical care, and research impact. Even in the face of the current challenges, I know that we all share the goal of sustaining this strong research momentum by reopening our research facilities and reengaging in our scholarship as soon as possible. We will do so but must maintain our first priority, which is to protect the health and well-being of all members of the campus community. I look forward to the recommendations of the Research and Graduate Education Task Force to insure that we do everything we can to meet your needs.</p>\n<p>Thanks to all of you for your continued efforts to sustain your scholarly activity during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>A.

As with all decisions we have made during these uncertain times, the health and well-being of our entire UB community is our guidepost and our priority.</p>\n<p>The planning for our virtual commencement exercises has begun, and further information about our graduates’ ceremonies will be communicated by their schools. At this point, we remain optimistic that we also will be able to recognize UB’s Class of 2020 during an on-campus celebration sometime later in the year.</p>\n<p>Regarding our summer session: To the greatest extent possible, UB will maintain a distance-learning platform throughout the entirety of the 2020 summer session. Please stay posted for additional details.</p>\n<p>Clearly, this is not the semester any of us had envisioned. From the first report of a “pneumonia of unknown cause” to the more-than 130,000 cases of COVID-19 in New York State, the pandemic has tested resolve, tapped reserves and toppled expectations.</p>\n<p>And yet, at the same time, this crisis has shown UB at our very best—our resilience, our creativity, our innovation, our adaptability.</p>\n<p>As I write to you, clinicians around the world are turning to international treatment guidelines co-authored by a UB faculty member. Our faculty and health care partners are launching a clinical trial into a potential treatment. Our staff has mobilized to collect and deliver desperately needed laboratory supplies for local testing. Our alumni, friends and university community are supporting an emergency fund for students with limited access to food, housing, technology and other resources.</p>\n<p>And, across the disciplines, our faculty have transitioned to a remote-learning model, ensuring that our students continue to receive the world-class education that will prepare them to lead in complex times.</p>\n<p>Although this public health crisis has profoundly altered our lives, I am heartened to see our university community responding to adversity with great intellect, resourcefulness and humanity. As we navigate our ever-changing situation, it is important not to lose sight of one critical fact: The University at Buffalo—whether through our research, our academic programs or our public-service mission—has always been focused on solving society’s most vexing problems. From our founding nearly 175 years ago, we have harnessed our intellect and our creative energy to tackle societal challenges here in Western New York, across New York State and around the world. We will continue do so because this is who we are as a university community.</p>\n<p>As we look hopefully toward a brighter future, let me reiterate how appreciative I am of the incredible work and accomplishments of our faculty, students and staff.</p>\n<p>Our embrace of diverse perspectives, our evidenced-based quest for answers, our commitment to positively impact the communities we serve and our sense of purpose are what bind us as a university community. This is UB. Together, we are UB.</p>\n<p>To our entire university community, near and far, please accept my best wishes for your good health and well-being.

As you know, this first week of term is dedicated to providing students with an opportunity to settle into online learning, and to allow faculty to communicate with you about course materials, procedures, and expectations. With that in mind, please follow each of these initial guidelines:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Finalize your schedule. Work with your advisor to confirm that the courses you see in REGIS are the courses you intend to take this term. The Registrar's Spring Term information page contains <a href=\"http://registrar.caltech.edu/current-students/sp-2019-20-term-information\">Registration Information for Students</a>.</li>\n<li>Enroll in all of your course Moodle sites after you have officially registered for those courses in REGIS. Students who attempt to enroll in a Moodle course for which they have not officially registered will be dropped from the Moodle.</li>\n<li>Consult with your advisor about schedule changes, which they need to pre-approve. Your schedule must be submitted to your advisor each day after you make a change, as this is the only way they can see your schedule.</li>\n<li>Respond to any preliminary communications and expectations sent to you by your instructors.</li>\n<li>Note that students are not permitted to audit courses this term. The only exception is Bi 252, and this exception only applies to students for whom Bi 252 is a requirement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"http://learn.caltech.edu\">Online Learning</a> website with important information about learning resources and tools for this Spring Term, as well as an FAQ. This website will be updated throughout the term.</p>\n<p>Please review closely the following information.</p>\n<h3><strong>Personal Privacy and Intellectual Property</strong></h3>\n<p>In an online learning environment, students must respect the privacy of their classmates and not share personal information about other students beyond the online classroom. Students must not share class recordings, transcripts, or links to lectures and discussion sessions with anyone who is not enrolled in the class, or teaching or supporting the class. While each student enrolled in a course should have access to all course materials and learning options, they should also remember they have an ethical responsibility as members of the Caltech community to keep this information private. Violations of these expectations may be considered violations of the Honor Code and of the Caltech Code of Conduct.</p>\n<h3><strong>Honor Code</strong></h3>\n<p>While many of you will be working at a distance from Caltech, you remain members of the Caltech community. It is still the case that \"No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.\" Students should be thoughtful and deliberate as they adjust their work habits and collaborative practices to an online learning environment. Review course collaboration policies carefully, and consult a course instructor or TA if you have questions or concerns.</p>\n<h3><strong>Current Residence Information</strong></h3>\n<p>With the undergraduate community now dispersed around the globe, Caltech needs to know where every student is actually residing during Spring Term. This information will be critically important as the public health emergency in our country continues to unfold. All enrolled students must therefore use the <a href=\"https://caltech.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5BdGWYmrKCSsxHT\">Current Residence Information Form</a> to provide the address where they are residing for Spring Term.</p>\n<h3><strong>Student Resources</strong></h3>\n<p>Many familiar resources remain available remotely, with necessary adjustments for the online learning environment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Student Wellness Services</strong> , including Counseling Services and Occupational Therapy, is serving students via secure and confidential telephone appointments. Students can schedule counseling or occupational therapy appointments by calling the main office number, (626) 395-8331, during regular business hours (8 a.m.-5 p.m. PDT, M-F). Student Wellness Services has created a <a href=\"https://wellness.caltech.edu/service-updates\">Service Updates page</a> to provide information and updates about Spring Term services.</li>\n<li><strong>The Deans' Office</strong> is accessible through email and phone. Deans are available to provide advising around Overloads, Underloads, Leaves, UASH petitions, and personal or familial matters. Students can directly e-mail the dean's office at deansoffice@caltech.edu, or schedule a time to speak with a dean via the <a href=\"https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/DeanofUndergraduateStudies@caltech.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/\">Online Booking System</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Deans Tutors</strong> are available through <a href=\"https://deans.caltech.edu/AcademicSupport/tutor\">Find a Tutor</a>, and will be able to meet with students via Skype, Hangouts, Zoom, or other platforms. Note that to access this website you must be logged into the Caltech VPN, where under \"Groups\" you need to select \"Tunnel All Traffic.\" If you have trouble identifying a tutor, please email deansoffice@caltech.edu for assistance.</li>\n<li>Your <strong>Freshman Advisors</strong> and <strong>Option Advisors</strong> are accessible via email as needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Caltech Accessibility Services for Students (CASS)</strong> is available via email and online at <a href=\"http://cass.caltech.edu\">CASS</a>. Students with academic accommodations are encouraged to continue to work with CASS during Spring Term.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Course Updates</strong></h3>\n<p>Since last week, the following updates on courses for the term have also been posted on the <a href=\"https://registrar.caltech.edu\">registrar's website</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ch 3a and Ch 3x will all be offered this term, with lab experiments and lectures pre-recorded, and mandatory, 1-hour live recitation sessions with a TA (assigned by time zone). The enrollment scaps have been removed.</li>\n<li>Some previously open courses now have enrollment limits.

At the same time, I need to set some clear interim expectations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The deadline for petitioning to remain in residence on campus is 5 p.m. today, Monday, March 16. Please respond immediately if you feel that you meet the criteria for remaining on campus and have not already done so.</strong> Those who have <a href=\"https://deansoffice.wufoo.com/forms/petition-to-remain-on-campus/\">submitted the form</a> have already been notified of the final decisions.  </li>\n<li>While <strong>4 p.m. on Friday, March 20 is the hard deadline to leave campus</strong> for undergraduates who have not been approved by the deans' office to remain, students should plan to leave campus as soon as possible.  </li>\n<li>The situation is changing rapidly outside Caltech, and there continue to be increased difficulties with transportation and restrictions on travel that may inhibit your ability to return home. Local preschool and K-12 closures are also creating challenges for staff and faculty, and the Institute needs to move quickly to prioritize the essential services required to sustain research and online instruction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students should prioritize departing campus rather than focusing on completing coursework or engaging in social activities. Students who have concerns about faculty not providing deadline extensions for exams or final coursework should contact the undergraduate deans. Students who need financial assistance to travel home should contact the financial aid office or the undergraduate deans. Housing staff are available to provide boxes for packing personal belongings and to assist in moving boxed belongings to Brown gym. Furniture and other large items can be labeled and left in rooms. A number of students have already taken advantage of the storage service.  </p>\n<p>In response to COVID-19 and in adherence with health professionals' guidance on social distancing practices, Caltech has canceled all Institute-sponsored events through June 12; this includes seminars, social gatherings, and other public performances and activities. With this in mind, the following measures are effective immediately for undergraduates and will remain in effect until further notice:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No social events or activities in the common areas of undergraduate residences.  </li>\n<li>No large social gatherings in individual rooms.  </li>\n<li>No visitors from outside the Caltech community, other than family helping you to pack, are allowed in the undergraduate residences.  </li>\n<li>No travel away from campus to attend social events or gatherings. Any travel away from campus should be brief and limited to shopping and obtaining supplies.  </li>\n<li>Students are expected to follow the preventative hygiene measures and guidance advised on <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/coronavirus\">Caltech's COVID-19 website</a>.  </li>\n<li>Violations of the conduct and drug and alcohol policies will not be tolerated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Students who violate any of these measures or other Institute policies will be required to leave residential housing and campus immediately. Sanctions for policy violations may also include ineligibility to enroll spring term and in subsequent terms. <strong>For students approved to remain on campus through spring term, these measures will remain in force until further notice.</strong>  </p>\n<p>Students who live locally or chose to relocate to nearby rental housing to complete spring term online are not permitted to enter campus to socialize or complete group work with students who have been granted approval to remain on campus. Similarly, students who are remaining on campus are not permitted to leave campus to visit other students. All undergraduate students must identify ways to collaborate through online resources.  </p>\n<p>Students who are staying locally and need to come onto campus to complete laboratory work must receive permission from a faculty member. Students who have departed campus already should not return to the undergraduate residences to retrieve personal belongings, or to use campus facilities. Students who feel that they need to retrieve personal belongings should contact housing staff, who will determine whether such requests can be accommodated.  </p>\n<p>COVID-19 is posing extraordinary challenges at Caltech and around the world. We expect undergraduate students to join the rest of the Institute community in focusing on the effort to safely sustain our education and research mission.</p>","id":"b3ff9301-3ab2-5b6b-8a43-d57c4d241563","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-caltech/2020-04-09-14_21_23/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Important Information for Undergraduates"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>To: Caltech Undergraduate Students<br>\nFrom: Joseph E. Shepherd, Vice President for Student Affairs<br>\nDate: March 12, 2020<br>\nRe: Update for Undergraduate Students on Caltech's Response to COVID-19  </p>\n<p>As a follow up to the most recent <a href=\"https://caltech.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0657df8937aa6f6a60b025e79&#x26;id=e4ff375f7a&#x26;e=6f1cd1b6ce\">community update</a> regarding Caltech's decision to officially end the instructional term on March 11, I wanted to both provide you with additional guidance that is particularly relevant to the undergraduate student community, and to share some of the reasoning behind the Institute's actions.  </p>\n<p>COVID-19 is a very real public health concern not only worldwide but in our local community and on campus. Caltech has an open campus and collaborates extensively with partners around the nation and the world, making it very challenging to control the introduction and spread of the virus.  </p>\n<p>If the public health situation deteriorates in our community, this may result in significant staff, faculty, and student illness, in which case we do not know if we will be able to keep all the student residences open. Our ability to cope with a substantial level of student illness may also be diminished if public schools and childcare in the area close, requiring staff to stay at home.  </p>\n<p>The likelihood of transmission increases substantially when there is a group living in close proximity that shares bathrooms and dining areas. Best practices in public health are to reduce or eliminate the possibility of transmission through dispersing individuals, practicing social distancing, and canceling in-person academic activities. To support these efforts, we need to reduce the population within the shared living environment of the undergraduate residences.  </p>\n<p>We agree with these concerns from public health officials and have acted on them. This is also why we are limiting in-person interaction, finishing the term online, and considering a move to online instruction in the spring. All academic and support groups on campus have been asked to be very mindful of hygiene, social distancing, limiting travel, and reducing the size of or eliminating large gatherings.  </p>\n<p>The Institute did not come to this decision easily. We know that this is very disruptive to our students' lives, and our academic and research programs. We have taken these precautionary steps out of concern for the welfare of our community. We are committed to returning to our traditional academic and business operations as soon as it is safe to do so.  </p>\n<p>This following information is based on the current situation and will be updated as the situation evolves.  </p>\n<p><strong>Campus Residences</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To help manage the evolving situation on campus, we are <strong>asking</strong> <strong>all undergraduate students to indicate whether they are planning to leave or stay on campus</strong> via <a href=\"https://caltech.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0657df8937aa6f6a60b025e79&#x26;id=eb782546b2&#x26;e=6f1cd1b6ce\">this webform</a>. Please fill out the form as soon as you know your plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Leaving campus</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We urge all undergraduate students who are able to do so, to return home as soon as possible to complete assignments and final exams electronically. This is in the best interest of student and community health.  </li>\n<li>If you would like to leave campus and have financial needs or other considerations that might prevent you from doing so, please contact the dean's office for additional guidance and support.  </li>\n<li>As you are packing, please take all valuables, any necessary medications, an adequate supply of clothing, books, your laptops and other electronics, etc. While on-campus instruction is currently scheduled to resume on March 30, this is a rapidly evolving situation and that schedule may change. You should be prepared to be away from campus longer than is currently expected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Remaining on campus</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students who need to remain in Caltech undergraduate housing may do so; however, they should be prepared for the possibility that the Institute may implement reduced or alternate dining services and shift room assignments in order to create quarantine space.  </li>\n<li>Any students who remain on campus need to be mindful of the inherent risks of congregate living environments. We are asking that students engage in appropriate social distancing, avoid student gatherings, and limit socializing in the residences and on campus. All social events in the residences have been canceled until April 6.  </li>\n<li>If you are an international student, live in an already-impacted area, or are otherwise unable to return home, you are permitted to stay on campus. If you would like to go elsewhere and need guidance, please consult with the Office of Residential Experience/Housing, which has curated a centralized list of student volunteers who have invited classmates to their personal residences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Academics</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Completing this term:</em> <strong>The Institute is asking faculty to provide a one-week extension for submission of exams, projects, and papers that are due to complete the winter term.</strong> You will be receiving communications from your instructors about how to complete final projects, problem sets, and exams. Please be attentive to the electronic messaging, emails, and websites that are used for communications in your classes.  </li>\n<li><em>Spring term:</em> We hope to be able to resume regular campus operations and classes on March 30, but the situation is continually evolving and we will need to evaluate our campus in light of the projected public health situation at that time. <strong>For now, the Institute has extended the deadline for academic eligibility for the spring term to April 17.</strong>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will stay in regular communication with you and provide timely updates on the resumption of classes. You will be receiving emails from Caltech that will provide essential information and instructions regarding the resumption of instruction, completion of graduation requirements, and return to campus. It is vitally important that you read your email on a regular basis to stay informed about these developments.  </p>\n<p>We are keenly aware that any prolonged closure or delay in starting classes will have an impact on many students, particularly graduating seniors and students with summer plans. The Deans and Registrar will be working with faculty and students to address and accommodate these circumstances.  </p>\n<p>We ask that students wishing to return early for spring term wait until the Institute has resumed regular operations. Please stay at home, monitor email communications on the status of the Institute, and contact the Housing Office for further instructions.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support services: During the time you are away from campus, the Hixon Writing Center will be conducting its one-to-one meetings with students online; you can find more information at <a href=\"https://caltech.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0657df8937aa6f6a60b025e79&#x26;id=38d168546d&#x26;e=6f1cd1b6ce\">http://writing.caltech.edu/</a>. <a href=\"https://caltech.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0657df8937aa6f6a60b025e79&#x26;id=3d759d2c6b&#x26;e=6f1cd1b6ce\">Caltech Accessibility Services for Students</a> will continue to support students with documented needs.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deans tutors will also continue to be available to support Caltech undergraduates.

Consider replacing handshakes with a wave and a smile.</li>\n<li>Finally, misinformation about COVID-19 is rampant, and can create confusion and panic. Rely on official communications from the CDC, PPHD, and the <a href=\"https://caltech.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0657df8937aa6f6a60b025e79&#x26;id=7d1760b49c&#x26;e=6f1cd1b6ce\">Caltech COVID-19 information webpage</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, please practice common-sense social distancing, which should include taking into account your and your family's risk profiles and enacting measures that will protect you and those around you. Current guidance from health officials is to maintain a distance of approximately 6 feet from others when possible.</p>\n<p> <strong>If you become ill</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you remain on campus and are ill with a fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other flu-like symptoms (such as sore throat, body aches, congestion), call Student Wellness Services at (626) 395-6393. <strong>Please do not come to the Student Wellness Services building unless you are directed to do so.</strong> It is important to limit your contact with others if you are ill. A healthcare provider will inquire about your symptoms and risk factors, and will give you further instructions regarding self-isolation. At this time, testing for COVID-19 is taking place at the direction of the Pasadena Public Health Department until commercial testing is available.  </li>\n<li>If you experience a medical emergency, please call Campus Security at (626) 395-5000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Mental health resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students who are experiencing increased anxiety or stress related to the virus, concerns about family overseas, or your personal health may contact Student Counseling Services for consultation and support.

This option applies only to this semester. As in the usual application of this option, professors are not told which students are taking their courses Pass/No Pass.</p>\n<p>Deadline to Drop or Add Second-Half Courses is TODAY: As you may recall from last week’s communication, the university extended this deadline by one week to today (Friday, March 27).</p>\n<p>Academic Advisor Check-Ins: We encourage undergraduates to review their plans with their academic advisors, and contact their navigators regarding other matters.</p>\n<p>No Make-Up Days for March 16-17: Because the cancellation of classes Monday and Tuesday (March 16-17) was part of the university’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak, they are being treated as the equivalent of cancellations required by inclement weather. The last day of classes remains Monday, April 27.</p>\n<p>Reading Days Remain: The reading days scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday (April 28-29) also are unchanged.</p>\n<p>May Term Courses Go Remote: In light of uncertainty regarding when the COVID-19 public health crisis will ease, the university has chosen to have May Term courses delivered remotely.</p>\n<p>Summer Term Registration Dates Delayed: Given that summer courses have start dates ranging from June 1 to July 6, the university continues to assess options regarding the delivery of these courses.

Specifically, we soon may need to re-assign many of you to spaces where you will live by yourselves, and where your distance from students living on the same floor or hall is greater than it otherwise would be.</p>\n<p>We recognize that this news represents yet another disruption in a semester far too full of them already. We deeply regret all of the changes this public health crisis has required—as well as the disappointments involved.</p>\n<p>We are letting you know of this possibility now in the event that we do need to act, even if only in a limited manner. If we do proceed, we will do everything possible to make the process as smooth and safe as possible. For example:</p>\n<p>The timing of relocations would be staggered to restrict the number of people moving at any one time;</p>\n<p>Students would receive at least three days’ advance notice before individual moves; and</p>\n<p>Students would receive packing boxes for their belongings.</p>\n<p>You will receive future communications with direction specific to your circumstances; for now, we ask that you continue to practice social distancing (maintaining at least six feet from others), and follow additional federal guidance regarding prevention.</p>\n<p>As with other changes, our goal is to lower the likelihood of virus transmission between individuals. The evidence shows that people who have no symptoms can infect others; in that context, we are doing all that we can to limit opportunities for exposure.</p>\n<p>To that end, two reminders:</p>\n<p>Any individuals staying in university residences without explicit university approval will be removed from that housing. Students living on campus without permission will be subject to the university’s judicial process, while those not affiliated with the university will be referred to university police.</p>\n<p>In addition, any on-campus students knowingly housing someone not authorized to remain on campus will face a disciplinary review.</p>\n<p>We share this information so that anyone failing to abide by university procedures is fully aware of the consequences.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reached agreement with providers to increase efforts to connect people who need access. UTech has provided details of the additional services on its website, under the headline “How to Get Connected and Stay Connected.\"</p>\n<p>Housing</p>\n<p>Departure Deadline: Students not approved to remain in campus housing must be out of their rooms as of noon, Sunday, March 22.

To allow you time to consider changes you might want to make to your courses, we have delayed the start of undergraduate registration for summer courses until April 13.</p>\n<p>We greatly appreciate the many adjustments that you have made so far this semester, and regret that this news adds still more. We hope that your experiences with remote classes so far can help inform your planning, and encourage consideration of the following topics:</p>\n<p>Schedule: Given students’ wide range of time zones, how might you change your overall class schedule?

Technical Requirements: In addition to Zoom itself, some courses have additional technical requirements. These should be shared with students as a Class Note in the SIS listing of the course.</p>\n<p>We also invite faculty not already scheduled for summer courses to reconsider offering them. You might have an idea for a new course relating to COVID-19, or even one that this semester’s remote teaching inspired. We encourage you to speak with your department chairs and/or Meagan Rodgers (meagan.rodgers@cwru.edu) with thoughts or questions.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, given the decision for remote teaching, chairs and faculty should make necessary adjustments to the summer teaching schedule and course information by April 9, in advance of opening summer registration.</p>\n<p>With regard to high school and undergraduate students participating in summer research, we have chosen to wait on this decision until we have more information regarding multiple issues, including the state’s stay-at-home order.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, our SOURCE office is asking students to consider different approaches to how they might manage research, from on-campus to hybrid to remote.

We are aware that these are anxious times and want to reassure you that we are monitoring developments continuously, that we will be direct and forthright in all of our communications, and that we have robust plans in place should additional actions be required. Further, we would like to express our appreciation to all members of the Clark community for your support for steps we are taking to address the COVID-19 challenge.</p>\n<p>As you know, the situation affecting other places in the U.S. and beyond continues changing rapidly. In light of these developments and the imperative of protecting Clark’s students, faculty, and staff, our COVID-19 Response Team and senior cabinet have made the following decisions:</p>\n<p>The University is canceling all admissions events involving large numbers of visitors from off-campus, including the open houses previously scheduled for April 4 and April 19. We are also suspending classroom visits and overnight stays by admissions guests. The Bassett Admissions Center remains open, and Admissions will continue to offer daily information sessions and tours.</p>\n<p>The University is canceling all off-campus alumni events.</p>\n<p>The University is canceling all events on campus that had been scheduled by outside groups of any size.</p>\n<p>The University is canceling all international faculty/student programs this spring and summer, including, for example, the May Term in Luxembourg.</p>\n<p>The University is informing individuals, offices, and organizations impacted by these decisions as rapidly as possible. These decisions will remain in effect until further notice.</p>\n<p>Amid this fast-moving situation, the University is evaluating all dimensions of University operations on a constant basis, reviewing related decisions by other universities and colleges, and remaining fully abreast of the guidance that continues to emerge from local, state, and federal health officials. As we make any resulting decisions, we will inform you promptly through email updates. Please visit Clark’s dedicated website regularly for the latest information.

For students who have traveled to China, Iran, South Korea or Italy: If you have traveled to a country that has been assigned a Level 3 travel advisory by the U.S. State Department due to verified cases of COVID-19 — at this time, these countries are China, Iran, South Korea, and Italy — we have special instructions for you during this time: do not return to Clark or Clark housing, limit your interactions with others, and do not visit with other Clark students. This instruction is guided by related CDC recommendations for those returning from China, as you will see here. This instruction also means you should not come back to the Clark campus for 14 days after having returned from your trip to any of these countries. Instead of returning to campus, email the office of the Dean of the College, which will assist you in arranging accommodations with your instructors to continue your coursework during this time. The email address to use is dean@clarku.edu. Graduate students should contact grad_dean@clarku.edu. Meanwhile, carefully monitor your health for 14 days after returning to the United States. If you show any symptoms of illness, please follow the CDC’s guidance for such travelers specified here.</p>\n<p>If you are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 (high fever, cough, shortness of breath) while at home, please immediately call (don’t visit) your health service provider. If you exhibit such symptoms after returning to campus, please immediately call (don’t visit) Clark Health Services at 508-793-7467. Please do not come to Health Services without first calling.</p>\n<p>We will send further updates as information changes or the situation necessitates.

Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions seem to be at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.</p>\n<p>The individual with COVID-19 has been in isolation at home since developing symptoms of the virus and getting the test taken. We wish this staff member a speedy and full recovery. We intend to honor the federal law that obligates us to protect this person’s privacy and as a result will not release their name.</p>\n<p>The local Department of Public Health (DPH) has identified all close contacts of the individual with COVID-19. “Close contacts” has a specific health meaning in this context. Clark University’s Health Services, under the direction of the local DPH, has notified all close contacts and provided them with the necessary quarantine instructions. Please note that if you have not been notified by Health Services, no action is needed at this time. University Health Services has confirmed that none of the close contacts are students.</p>\n<p>Our COVID-19 Response Team and Emergency Response Cabinet have been deliberating extensively the potential implications of a positive test result in this instance or should another such instance emerge. The health and safety of our faculty, students, and staff remains our highest priority. We also know our community supports the essential societal goal at this time of increasing social distancing and protecting the health of the most vulnerable. In this light it is important for you to know that students and all others on campus should continue to operate as follows:</p>\n<p>When possible, err on the side of interacting or conducting business with all others on campus through email, phone, or video conferencing. All formal meetings should be conducted in this manner.</p>\n<p>Arrange living and workspaces as needed to eliminate close contact if at all possible.</p>\n<p>Scrupulously follow CDC guidelines to protect themselves and others.</p>\n<p>One of the most important insights from public health authorities, in the U.S. and around the world, is that how a community responds to emerging cases can have direct impact on the outbreak’s duration and severity. By looking out for ourselves and one another and heeding the public health expertise available to us, we can help to slow the spread of the virus.</p>\n<p>If students, faculty, or staff seek counseling support, please know it is available to you.

We understand that some offerings will simply not be possible as a result of this decision, but we do expect that many of the planned courses will be able to be offered in the remote, online format, and that additional courses may now be able to be available in this mode.</p>\n<p>To support this transition and to encourage the development of new course-based offerings, we have assembled a working group that has established a set of principles and guidance for the development and delivery of new curricular and co-curricular programs for Carnegie Mellon undergraduate and graduate students this summer.</p>\n<p>Detailed information will follow directly to those most impacted by this decision regarding established CMU summer programs and activities, including Pre-College programs as well as already planned summer courses, work and research activities for CMU degree-seeking students. Similarly, additional communications will follow about the resumption of traditional on-campus research activities, which are currently being conducted remotely or have been halted until at least the end of April.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge the burden this may cause the students who may need to alter their summer plans as well as the faculty and staff involved in the planning, teaching and execution of our regular on-campus summer programming. This is a necessary decision in order to protect the health and well-being of our university community. I am confident we will continue to see creativity and innovation in transitioning existing offerings and developing new opportunities for remote, online delivery this summer.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Garrett, Provost</p>","id":"d18e19dd-280b-545c-acce-c62d6c097c96","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-cmu/2020-04-08-23_42_29/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Summer Programs Moving to Remote and Online Operation"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cmu.edu/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Details About Transition to Remote Research and Teaching Operations</p>\n<p>March 19, 2020</p>\n<p>A Message for CMU Faculty and Researchers,</p>\n<p>As you read in today’s message from President Jahanian, we are taking preventative measures to keep our community healthy and safe during the rapid spread of the coronavirus, COVID-19. Farnam’s message earlier today established a deadline of March 25 to move to fully remote research operations. Late this afternoon, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued an order mandating all non-life-sustaining businesses in the state to close by 8 p.m. on March 19. We are working to discern the full impact of the order on Carnegie Mellon.</p>\n<p>While the order exempts virtual and telework operations, it is clear that both research and teaching activities will be impacted. Thus, it is imperative that these activities be moved to remote operation as quickly as possible. The Governor’s order states that enforcement will start on Saturday, March 21.</p>\n<p>In light of this order, all CMU research and teaching activities must move to fully remote operations immediately.</p>\n<p>Teaching from faculty offices, classrooms, or laboratories must move off campus and now be done remotely.</p>\n<p>If your research activities cannot be done remotely, please plan to postpone on-campus work and replace it with off-campus work through at least the end of April and take the necessary steps to shut down your operations and secure your labs. As you make this transition, please continue to practice social distancing protocols.</p>\n<p>We expect that the only research-related activities permitted in CMU facilities moving forward will be those approved by a college and satisfy very specific functions, including:</p>\n<p>sustaining living organisms and perishable specimens, and</p>\n<p>maintaining the facilities and equipment necessary to allow remote operation.</p>\n<p>Researchers who believe they need critical short-term access to campus to maintain irreplaceable, long-term research studies that cannot be conducted remotely must receive approval from their dean and the vice president for research. Deans and/or associate deans for research will communicate the protocols for requesting consideration of these critical short-term needs. Approval of such activity will only be granted in exceptional circumstances pending further clarification of the Governor’s order.</p>\n<p>Please note the following:</p>\n<p>Negative impact on costs and schedule will not be adequate justification for approval of special cases.</p>\n<p>Under no circumstances will “routine” research activities be granted permission, regardless of the length of time spent on premises.</p>\n<p>A student must not be designated as the primary person responsible for any of the functions described above.</p>\n<p>Under no circumstances should a student who is uncomfortable coming to campus for research-related activities be compelled or pressured to do so.</p>\n<p>Staff who have reservations or concerns about performing allowable activities on campus are encouraged to engage with their Human Resources business partner and their department.</p>\n<p>Moving research to remote operation will reduce the number of people on campus. Additional steps we are taking at this time are:</p>\n<p>No in-person research-related meetings should occur, nor should CMU host any research-related visitors at this time.</p>\n<p>All research-related visits planned during this period should be postponed; no new requests for collaborating visits that occur during this period will be processed or approved.</p>\n<p>External visitors who are already present on campus must also work remotely and must not have responsibility for performing any of the allowable functions described above.</p>\n<p>We recognize many of you will have to pivot your research activities and plans over the next month. It is our expectation that researchers will make every effort to continue their grant activities, as well as justify staff and student efforts for current funding sources. Working remotely provides an opportunity to complete data analysis, literature reviews, manuscript submissions, professional development and other activities that do not require a physical presence in a campus facility.</p>\n<p>It is our intention that all graduate students receiving stipends and associated support, such as health care insurance premium coverage, will continue to receive that support through the remainder of the semester as they work remotely. Faculty supervisors and departments are responsible for ensuring the appropriate funding sources are used for this purpose. Please be advised that federal and non-federal sponsors continue to issue guidance and amendments to policies in these uncertain circumstances. In the near term (i.e., the next 30 days) we are asking researchers to continue to charge student, staff and faculty efforts to their existing funding sources. During this time, researchers should work with their departmental research administrators, Sponsored Projects Accounting (SPA) and/or the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) should any issues arise. In the event an individual working on an existing sponsored award requests to work remotely from a foreign country, please contact OSP.</p>\n<p>The information above, as well as additional guidance, can be found on the CMU Coronavirus Researcher Resources webpage and CMU Teaching Online Resource webpage. Please check the site frequently. In addition, we will continue to update the entire research community with regular communications. If you have additional questions, please contact your associate dean for research and copy drbc@andrew.cmu.edu to ensure we can track the request.</p>\n<p>We appreciate your cooperation in helping to keep our campus safe and protecting the health of our community during these uncertain times.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Michael McQuade, Vice President of Research</p>\n<p>Jim Garrett, Provost</p>","id":"5cf5b080-198c-58dc-8b58-3b8db694f738","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-cmu/2020-04-08-23_42_37/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Details About Transition to Remote Research and Teaching Operations"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cmu.edu/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>A Message About Commencement</p>\n<p>March 23, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear CMU Students,</p>\n<p>I am writing with deep regret to let you know that we will not be able to hold this year’s Commencement exercises on the Pittsburgh campus on May 17 as planned.</p>\n<p>To our graduating students, this decision – like so many of the past few weeks – ranks among the hardest I have had to make as president. You have sacrificed several cherished CMU traditions during your final semester, and it pains me to add one more. We already miss the unmistakable energy that fills every corner of this campus when you are here, and we share in your sadness at this moment as well.</p>\n<p>Along with my university faculty and staff colleagues, we were looking forward to opportunities this spring, including Commencement, to come together as a community to celebrate your collective and individual accomplishments. For our graduating Ph.D. students, we salute the incredible works you have created as capstones to your careers as students. For our graduating master’s degree students, we appreciate the impact you have made on our campus in the time you have been with us through your scholarship, research and participation in campus life. And for our graduating seniors, we hope this circumstance does not diminish the special experiences you have had at CMU, nor the enduring bonds you have formed with friends, faculty, and staff.</p>\n<p>While it will look different, we still plan to pay tribute to your successes! We will virtually confer degrees at the end of the semester, and we are exploring ways we can celebrate the Class of 2020’s outstanding achievements together on campus in the next academic year. We are also looking into other creative ways to connect with this cohort of graduates, whether in Pittsburgh or in other areas around the world. We will share details about these programs with students and families as they are confirmed.</p>\n<p>As with the other unparalleled steps we have taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have come to this decision in order to protect the health and well-being of our entire community and to comply with guidance by the CDC to avoid large gatherings. We also are making this call now to provide this year’s graduates and their families with as much time as possible to plan accordingly.</p>\n<p>To all CMU students: I am unbelievably proud of the many ways you have risen to the occasion and pulled together to get through these recent challenges, one day at a time. Over the coming months, you will continue to prove that being a Tartan goes beyond any physical location, and that our community truly comes to life in the connections we share with one another. These lifelines are more valuable than ever before, and I encourage all of us to nurture them however we can. Please keep in touch with your friends via video chat, phone, or text message! These (virtual) check-ins will help sustain your emotional, physical and mental health during this quarantine.</p>\n<p>It is nearly impossible to overstate how challenging and distressing this unfolding crisis has been for communities around the world, but I continue to be inspired by the ways our CMU family has responded with patience, fortitude and relentless optimism. I am especially grateful to the faculty and staff who have been working around-the-clock to ensure the best possible remote learning experience and to support you as you adapt to a technology-enhanced, online education and experience.</p>\n<p>Life will eventually return to normal, and we look forward to welcoming returning students back to campus again. For those of you who will graduate this May, we look forward to welcoming you back as alumni. In the meantime, keep your spirits up, continue to support and look out for one another, and take pride in being part of the CMU family.</p>\n<p>Be well,</p>\n<p>Farnam</p>","id":"19193cab-b6f9-51c8-a10e-5c0255006cd3","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-cmu/2020-04-08-23_42_33/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CMU-Alert Emergency Notification System"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cmu.edu/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Next Phase: Transition to Remote Research Operations and Other Campus Changes</p>\n<p>March 19, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the CMU Community:</p>\n<p>Last week we announced the decision to move all educational instruction to remote delivery, with online classes beginning yesterday, and we have continued to advance efforts across the university to promote social distancing and protect our community. I wish to thank all faculty, students and staff for your perseverance, creativity and hard work during this transition.</p>\n<p>This has been a time of tremendous transition and has been difficult for all of us, but I am confident we can continue to work together to take the necessary precautions while also safeguarding the strength of our mission and the bonds of our communities around the world.</p>\n<p>Today, to continue to be proactive in this fast-moving situation, we are beginning the next phase of our efforts to slow the potential for community spread of COVID-19. This includes modifications to research operations and certain services to minimize the number of people on campus and adhere to social-distancing guidelines.</p>\n<p>While campus is not closed, we want everyone who can work remotely — faculty, students and staff — to do so. This is the motivation behind all of the steps we are announcing today.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, the following principles apply to all Carnegie Mellon locations. Further details specific to individual campuses or locations will be sent in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Remote Research Operations</p>\n<p>As soon as is practicable and no later than Wednesday, March 25 at 5 p.m. local time, we are moving all research activities to remote operations. Where that is not possible, on-campus research activities will be placed on hold and replaced with related off-campus work through at least the end of April.</p>\n<p>Through our ongoing contingency planning process, we have been working with CMU leadership to understand the activities that must be maintained to ensure health and safety and to minimize as best as possible the disruption to ongoing research programs. As such, only very specific functions including sustaining living organisms and perishable specimens and maintaining the facilities and equipment necessary to allow remote operation, will be permitted. A communication to the research community providing more details on the specific activities that will be permitted will follow later today and will be posted on the OVPR website.</p>\n<p>Executing this will take creativity, flexibility and transparency on the part of our deans, department heads, graduate students and research staff, as well as the counsel and guidance of Vice President for Research Michael McQuade and Provost Jim Garrett. We have been preparing for this possibility for some time and believe that the coming days will give researchers the needed time to execute this move to remote operation.</p>\n<p>Student Workers</p>\n<p>I know there are some students who may feel they need to weigh the financial cost of studying remotely due to their on-campus job. Student safety is our primary concern and your campus employment should not factor into your decision to stay on campus. We will support all student workers in finding alternative remote assignments or, if that is not possible, we will help to arrange other financial support for students as needed. More information will be provided by Provost Garrett and Dean Gina Casalegno in a follow-up communication.</p>\n<p>Staff Remote Work</p>\n<p>We are committed to working creatively with all supervisors and employees (other than employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement), including hourly workers, to support them in performing remote work this semester. For those employees (other than employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement) whose current positions do not allow for remote work, it is our intention to find work that can be done remotely through the end of this academic year, after which time we hope to resume our normal operations. In the event remote work is not possible, we will work with those employees on a case by case basis to try and address their situation, so they are able to earn their compensation. Human Resources will follow up with more information for all employees, including those covered by a collective bargaining agreement, in a forthcoming message.</p>\n<p>Closing of University Libraries</p>\n<p>All University Libraries will close Friday at 6 p.m. local time. While each location will be physically closed, librarians will continue their work to support the CMU community with remote teaching and research.</p>\n<p>Dining and Other Campus Services in Pittsburgh</p>\n<p>In alignment with Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf’s directive to limit restaurants to take-out service, all open CMU dining facilities on the Pittsburgh campus have already transitioned to take-out only. Further changes will be announced in a forthcoming message from Provost Garrett and Dean Casalegno. All residential students who remain living on campus will have dining services available to them, albeit in a reduced capacity.</p>\n<p>While we will continue to maintain limited housing, dining and other critical functions – such as University Health and Counseling Services – to meet the needs of the students who cannot finish their semester remotely, several other Pittsburgh campus services are also being modified to adhere to new guidance aimed at enhancing social distancing. More detailed information is forthcoming from Provost Garrett and Dean Casalegno.</p>\n<p>Facilities and University Police</p>\n<p>Especially during this time, we are committed to maintaining safety and security on campus with a fully staffed University Police Department. In addition, as remote instruction gets underway and with many community members working from home, exterior doors to CMU buildings are transitioning to card-key access, where possible. You will need to swipe your CMU ID to enter the building. To enter buildings not capable of card-key access, you will need to seek the assistance of University Police and show them your CMU ID. Officers will be increasing their presence to assist with access and other matters.</p>\n<p>I want to reemphasize two important reminders. First, it is imperative to adhere to social-distancing guidelines — keep six feet (two meters) of distance between you and others at all times. Second, please continue to visit CMU’s coronavirus website for the most updated information.</p>\n<p>I have typically ended messages to campus during difficult times by encouraging you to take care of one another. Today, I wish to leave you with a different message, inspired by the words of United States Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome Adams, who recently advised citizens to be “acting as if we have the virus.” Each and every one of us should be modifying our personal behavior with the assumption that keeping our distance from others is the most powerful way we can protect our loved ones and our communities.</p>\n<p>This is a global call to action, and I urge you to do your part. Stay at home. Stay safe. And be well.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Farnam Jahanian</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Henry L.

The first is to express my deepest appreciation to everyone for the extraordinary actions taken over these past two weeks to transform the University in ways that will allow us, as much as possible, to continue our work while we, the nation, and the world confront the unprecedented threat of the virus known as COVID-19. I am in awe of the students—and the staff, parents, and friends who supported them—who moved out of the residence halls these last few days, not just for the orderly ways in which it was carried out but for the spirit of citizenship and shared sacrifice that defined it. You heeded the call and showed that there is still, indeed, life in the commons. To those students who have needed to remain due to exceptional circumstances, I want to reassure you that we will continue to provide essential services even with the announcement today from the governor to further reduce our workforce.</p>\n<p>The second purpose for this message is to say that, with the exception of clinical education, I am postponing all instruction for the first three days of next week in order to give everyone a little more time to prepare to resume classes for the final few weeks of the semester. Classes will continue virtually on Thursday, March 26th. And, further, with respect to courses, working with each of your schools, we have decided that all classes this semester will be graded pass/fail. This, of course, does not reflect a reduction in expectations, but rather an acknowledgment of the severe complications of this unusual moment.</p>\n<p>The third purpose is heartbreaking. Given life as it now is, we cannot go forward with Commencement ceremonies on May 20th, as planned. And, unfortunately, we are not in a position at this moment to announce an alternative plan. The situation is too uncertain, and any plans made now run a high risk of having to be abandoned as circumstances change. But this I can assure you: I will confer degrees on May 20th. We are and will continue thinking about this every day, and we will have a plan to honor and celebrate your successes. Speaking personally, there is no academic ceremony I love more, and I expect to love this one the most.</p>\n<p>The world has moved on to a different plane, one none of us could have anticipated a short while ago. I want to say, on behalf of all of Columbia, that we are, as always, ready to do our part, which, given the assembled talent and public spiritedness of this community, is never inconsiderable. While a stillness pervades Morningside Heights, that does not mean our work has abated. Meanwhile, a very different atmosphere characterizes our medical campus in Washington Heights, where our colleagues are girding to face the fraught and daunting challenges to come. Indeed, the outpouring of time, effort, commitment, and personal sacrifice of those serving on the front line of the CUIMC campus are already very palpable. This dedication also portrays the work of all employees essential to keeping the University in operation. My deepest thanks to everyone.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Lee C. Bollinger</p>","id":"ad3dfd03-56b5-5b26-b284-d7068d6d894b","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-columbia/2020-04-08-23_39_55/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update on Course Instruction and University Commencement"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://covid19.columbia.edu/themes/custom/columbia/favicon-crown.png\"></p>\n<p>Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:</p>\n<p>As promised, I am writing with an update on how the University needs to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. We all know this is a rapidly evolving and very challenging situation. Yesterday afternoon, the World Health Organization officially declared this to be a pandemic. Thus far, we continue to have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on our campuses. Just to be clear, the principle that has guided us up to this point is to maintain the mission of the University as much as possible consistent with preserving the health of every part of our community. To that end, as of yesterday, we launched nearly 2,000 classes online and continue to prepare to teach classes virtually for the remainder of the semester.</p>\n<p>In light of the spread of the virus, especially in the New York metropolitan region, we now need to take further steps. Specifically, in order to reduce the density of our residential environment, while respecting the interests and needs of students who have reason to continue to remain in residence on campus, we are instituting three critical decisions: (1) The University will remain open and functioning; (2) All classes for the remainder of the semester will be conducted online; and (3) We encourage any students who are able to move out of undergraduate residence halls for the rest of the semester to do so, and we are ready to help in that process. The Office of University Life and your school will follow up with more information.</p>\n<p>It is worth repeating that our campuses will remain open. However, we have restrictions in place for those who have traveled to severely affected areas, as per guidance from the CDC. We will, as indicated previously, actively discourage congregations in large numbers. We also strongly discourage holding any events with over 25 people, at least through April 30th. All Columbia business travel, both international and domestic, is now suspended for all affiliates.</p>\n<p>This is a hard time for all of us. We are concerned about every student, colleague, friend, and neighbor. Clearly, balancing all of the interests of all parts of the institution is an extraordinarily complex undertaking. I am so grateful to all of you and especially to those who daily help us chart the right course for Columbia through this crisis.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Lee C.

Aside from the significant disruptions to daily life and academic studies that all of us are experiencing, undoubtedly many of us will personally know someone whose health is directly affected by COVID-19. That’s true in my case, with my younger daughter in New York City. I empathize with those of you who also are trying to stay in touch with distant loved ones.</p>\n<p>Graduate students may not have received the March 30 communication to faculty and staff from the Provost and the Executive Vice President on managing the financial impact of COVID-19. I am writing to address some of the issues raised in that communication, and other topics that may be useful to graduate students, graduate faculty, and staff supporting graduate programs.</p>\n<p>The March 30 communication acknowledges that there are, and will continue to be for many semesters, significant financial impacts associated with COVID-19 disruptions. University leadership is implementing several steps to manage risks associated with economic uncertainty, including a hiring freeze on staff and temporary workers, a salary freeze, a travel ban, changes to summer programs, curtailment of discretionary spending, and reevaluation of capital projects. Details are in the March 30 communication.</p>\n<p>For the Graduate School, we anticipate consequences of the actions detailed in this communication (March 30) will include the following:</p>\n<p>Travel Funding: Related to the travel ban, we will strive to continue to make Graduate School funding available for our research travel grant program for graduate students after general pandemic-related travel restrictions are lifted. It is quite likely that conference travel grants will not be available until Cornell’s travel ban is lessened or lifted.</p>\n<p>Related to the travel ban, we will strive to continue to make Graduate School funding available for our research travel grant program for graduate students after general pandemic-related travel restrictions are lifted.

Today, I write to share some of those opportunities and other resources you may find helpful during this transition.</p>\n<p>Virtual Campus Resources:</p>\n<p>The Campus Activities office has created a new virtual engagement website where you can connect with student organizations, listen to Cornell Chimes and stay informed about live virtual concerts.</p>\n<p>The Office of Engagement Initiatives is offering community-engaged learning options virtually.</p>\n<p>Many Cornell University Library services are accessible remotely.</p>\n<p>The Cornell Store has partnered with VitalSource and publishers to provide free access to e-books through May 25.</p>\n<p>Personal and Professional Development:</p>\n<p>Cornell Career Services is available to help you plan for and navigate your next steps. Virtual appointments can be made with career advisors by calling (607) 255-5296.</p>\n<p>CUeLINKS is a great way to network with alumni virtually.</p>\n<p>Public service can be continued virtually though programs, such as Be My Eyes, Charity Miles and School in the Cloud.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in learning a new skill before classes start, Cornell students have free, unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning with Lynda.com, which offers thousands of training videos on graphic design, entrepreneurship, finance, personal development and much more.</p>\n<p>Health and Well-being:</p>\n<p>Remote physical and mental health services are available through Cornell Health.</p>\n<p>Cornell Recreation Services is offering virtual group fitness classes, including yoga, high intensity interval training (HIIT) and Zumba.</p>\n<p>The Cornell Botanic Gardens has created a series of videos to support mindfulness and meditation while giving viewers a glimpse of spring at Cornell.</p>\n<p>Netflix Party lets you watch shows and movies with your family and friends remotely.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t already done so, I encourage you to prepare for online classes by testing your devices and practicing Zoom meetings with friends or family in advance. Please refer to Vice Provost Lisa Nishii’s March 22 message for information on troubleshooting, as well as other support for your academic programs.</p>\n<p>Cornellians, just as you have throughout this year on campus, please continue to support and be kind to each other, ask for help when you need it, and provide feedback to faculty and administrators about your virtual learning experience. I must also implore you to please continue following social distancing guidelines based on your location. For those of us in New York, the governor has declared a temporary ban on all non-essential gatherings of any size, for any reason, among other social distancing measures.</p>\n<p>This is new territory for all of us, and if we work together, we can make the best of the situation we’ve been given. I continue to send you goodwill and my very best wishes for your health and that of your loved ones.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Ryan</p>\n<p>Ryan Lombardi, Vice President for Student and Campus Life</p>","id":"7b459a66-cdfb-5d7e-a40d-96fe70e3c769","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-cornell/2020-04-08-23_39_17/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus Updates"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cornell.edu/coronavirus/_assets/images/coronavirus-highres.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Graduate School COVID-19 Update: Academic calendar changes and more</p>\n<p>March 23, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Graduate School Community,</p>\n<p>I am writing with updates and additional information. This is a difficult time for everyone. Many of us are worried and uncertain about what might come next. We are all trying to adjust our lives and set up remote workstations while we safeguard our health and the well-being of those around us. We appreciate the patience, flexibility, and resilience that graduate students, faculty, staff, and graduate fields are exhibiting.</p>\n<p>We know that working remotely is complicated, and involves navigating daily with those sharing our work-from-home situation, whether that includes roommates, partners, children, parents, other relatives, or friends. Everyone is under a great deal of stress and operating under conditions of uncertainty and rapid change. Please take care of yourself and stay (virtually) connected with those from whom you draw support.</p>\n<p>The situation continues to be dynamic. Changes in the last several days include postponement of Cornell’s Commencement, extension of the academic year, and additional campus access restrictions based on NY Governor Cuomo’s recent order that non-essential New York state businesses must move to all-remote work. Below is a recap of recent updates and frequent questions.</p>\n<p>Academic Calendar</p>\n<p>Due to the pause in classes as the university moves to remote instruction, the academic calendar (for the Ithaca campus, including undergraduate and graduate programs; some professional degree programs and Cornell Tech have program-specific calendars) has changed to the following:</p>\n<p>First day of online instruction: Monday, April 6</p>\n<p>Last day of drop/grade change: Tuesday, April 21</p>\n<p>Last day of online instruction: Tuesday, May 12</p>\n<p>Exam period: May 16-May 23</p>\n<p>Assistantships and Stipends</p>\n<p>Graduate assistantship and fellowship stipends will be maintained, as communicated by the Provost on March 15, and by the Graduate School on March 13. The salaries and stipends of staff, students, and postdocs will continue on grants or other sources as usual. (See COVID-19 Update: Conduct of Research from 3/15/20 and the FAQs from the Research Division for more information.) Work on your academic, research, scholarship, and teaching responsibilities remotely, and stay in touch with your faculty advisor/supervisor to gain their guidance on how to plan your activities over the coming weeks to be most productive.</p>\n<p>Faculty supervisors and graduate students should remember that University Policy 1.3 is still in effect, with the hours/week limits on assistantship duties as required in that policy. (See Additional Guidance for Faculty from 3/13/20.) Cornell’s Research Division emphasizes: “It is important to remember that under no circumstances should graduate students or postdocs be required to go into the laboratory or perform any essential research tasks against their will. Students with concerns should contact their Director of Graduate Studies, Department Chair, or the Dean of the Graduate School.”</p>\n<p>To take care of your physical health, follow Cornell Health advice. Please let your supervisor know if you become ill and need to have time to get well, including if you are directed by a primary care physician, health department, or other health professional to self-quarantine or isolate, and you are temporarily not able to conduct activities associated with your academic progress, or to conduct duties associated with your assistantship.</p>\n<p>Graduate students are not required to use vacation time available to them under University Policy 1.3 to cover time away because of illness. Graduate students on fellowships and assistantships who experience illness and need time to get well, including if you are directed by a health professional to self-quarantine or isolate because of pandemic-related issues, will continue to receive their assistantships. This includes assistantships funded by sponsored awards.</p>\n<p>The approval process normally required by University Policy 1.3 (p.14) is not required when a graduate student has been directed to quarantine or isolate by an authorized health professional. Take the time you need to recover and be well, and to continue to practice social distancing (or isolation/quarantine) from others.</p>\n<p>Recent Communications and FAQs</p>\n<p>With national, state, and local restrictions changing frequently, the university is working hard to keep students updated. Policies have evolved considerably over the past week. I encourage you to review Cornell statements and news, especially the messages for faculty, graduate students, and for teaching and learning. All COVID-19 university statements are posted.</p>\n<p>The Graduate School resource page includes links to virtual wellness opportunities, public health information, Cornell COVID-19 websites, tips on working remotely, and much more. These are updated frequently.</p>\n<p>Getting Support</p>\n<p>Graduate School staff are available with extended hours to help students in different time zones and on varying schedules navigate rapidly changing requirements. All offices, including our administrative and deans offices, are available by phone or email. Several offices have extended their hours, including Student Services, Student Life, and Inclusion and Student Engagement to meet varying graduate student needs and living locations. See Updated Graduate School Hours for more complete information.</p>\n<p>Cornell Health remains open, but is deferring non-urgent visits and expanding their telehealth capabilities. Please visit their website for up-to-date information about making appointments, picking up prescriptions, and talking with or seeing health care professionals.</p>\n<p>Moving Forward</p>\n<p>As we acclimate to remote workspaces, staying connected (virtually) to your faculty, colleagues, and peers, as well as friends, neighbors, and family will become increasingly important. We are all in this together.</p>\n<p>Reach out and share a virtual lunch, schedule meetings, and check-in with the people in your life. Video call and conferencing over Facetime, Zoom, and with other technologies can help you feel more connected and help you keep motived and on task with your academic progress. Already, some students have set up virtual writing groups, virtual lab meetings, and virtual journal clubs. See these suggested virtual engagement tools.</p>\n<p>The Graduate School is collecting your ideas for staying connected and being productive. I invite you to share ideas for establishing community and being productive while working remotely. We’ll collect these and post to our website and in our weekly Announcements. Submit your ideas here.</p>\n<p>I thank our graduate community - staff, faculty, and students - for working together and rising to meet these difficult challenges. If you have questions, please contact us at gradschooldeans@cornell.edu.</p>\n<p>Best wishes, and stay well!</p>\n<p>Barb</p>\n<p>Barbara Knuth, Dean of the Graduate School</p>","id":"4dce1cec-c626-5b46-aa9a-0c67c06b4f38","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-cornell/2020-04-08-23_39_21/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Graduate School COVID-19 Update: Expedited Campus Operations Changes"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cornell.edu/coronavirus/_assets/images/coronavirus-highres.jpg\"></p>\n<p>COVID-19 update: Revised academic calendar and online instruction resources</p>\n<p>March 22, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Cornell Undergraduates,</p>\n<p>Greetings from Ithaca. We hope that you are safe and comfortable wherever you will be for the rest of the spring semester. I’d like to acknowledge how stressful this transition has been for everyone. I suspect that, like me, you may have times when you feel completely overwhelmed by uncertainty and the demands of adapting to an entirely new lifestyle. I hope that, like me, you are also feeling more connected to loved ones – even if you can only connect virtually – as you check in on, support and even have fun with them. There are still a lot of unanswered questions about exactly how the rest of the semester is going to unfold, not only because of uncertainty about the virus itself but also because a fully online learning environment is new to almost all faculty and students.</p>\n<p>Please know that faculty have been working extremely hard to learn new technologies and rethink how they can deliver a meaningful learning experience using different media. They are aware that you are now in different time zones and that some of you may be worried about whether you will be able to connect reliably to online course materials, have an environment that is conducive to learning and be able to maintain your standards for academic engagement and performance. Many of them are worried about the same. At the same time, faculty are excited to re-think traditional modes of teaching. This experience may offer opportunities to explore innovative online classroom ideas.</p>\n<p>We all need to learn as we go and be patient with each other. Please communicate clearly and often – about how you are doing, your needs and concerns and any other questions you may have – and also do your part to remain informed about what others are trying to communicate to you. The university is posting new information as it becomes available through this FAQ page; I highlight here some key updates.</p>\n<p>To accommodate for lost instruction time due to the two-week suspension of classes, the academic calendar for this semester has been revised as follows (these changes apply to all undergraduates except students in the Cornell in Rome and AAP in NYC programs and students who are completing their semesters through their study-abroad institutions):</p>\n<p>First day of online instruction, Monday April 6</p>\n<p>Last day to ADD a seven-week course, Tuesday, April 14</p>\n<p>Last day for DROP/Grade Change, Tuesday, April 21</p>\n<p>Last day of online instruction, Tuesday, May 12</p>\n<p>Study Days, May 13 - 15</p>\n<p>Exam Period, May 16 - 23</p>\n<p>The FAQ page provides specific guidance on how to adjust to the revised calendar. Please note that the deadline for drop/grade basis change has been extended to April 21, and undergraduate students may opt for S/U grading in any course (except seven-week courses that have already been completed and graded), with S grades counting towards major, minor and academic good standing requirements this semester. Students should contact their college advising office prior to any drops or grading basis changes to discuss potential implications. Please be aware that dropping below 12 academic credits will pose significant difficulty to your academic progress and financial aid. Virtual student advising will continue to be available throughout the semester as will other counseling and support services.</p>\n<p>The Learning Strategies Center (LSC) has prepared a remote learning preparedness checklist that you should follow carefully. Please test your online access and familiarity with Canvas and Zoom well in advance of April 6 to troubleshoot any problems. If you run into problems, staff are ready to provide you with general IT help or support related specifically to Canvas. The LSC has prepared useful tips for adapting your learning strategies for a remote learning environment as well as guidelines you can share with your families to support you during this transition. If you do not have Internet access at home, Spectrum is providing free Internet access for a limited time amid COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Classes will meet online at their original time to reduce conflicts, but all lectures will be recorded or otherwise posted to accommodate students in alternate time zones. Faculty have been advised to be flexible when scheduling discussion sessions and office hours to ensure that students have opportunities to interact with them and each other regardless of time zone. The LSC will also continue offering tutoring and other academic support, and Student Disabilities Services (SDS) will continue to support students’ needs for accommodations, including those who are not yet registered with SDS but have concerns about needing an accommodation in order to participate in online learning.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, the full FAQ page provides all of this information and more. We will not send out new emails with every update, so I urge you to check the FAQ, which will be updated regularly. Again, we truly do understand how disruptive and challenging all of this is for you. This is not how any of us expected the academic year to unfold. Stay healthy and stay strong. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your academic advisor, department chair or me, at ovpue@cornell.edu. We, your Cornell community, are here for you.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Lisa Nishii</p>\n<p>Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education</p>","id":"0c4fb511-7f6a-58a2-a7ca-5d2e8d7c4fc8","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-cornell/2020-04-08-23_39_25/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus Updates"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.cornell.edu/coronavirus/_assets/images/coronavirus-highres.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Pollack Outlines Guiding Principles for COVID-19 Response</p>\n<p>April 7, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Cornellians,</p>\n<p>Wherever you may be as you are reading this, I want to start by asking you to picture Cornell in your mind. Many of you will picture the Ithaca campus: perhaps Libe Slope, or the Arts Quad, or West Campus, or perhaps Schoellkopf Field, or the Botanic Gardens. Others of you may conjure a picture of the terrace outside the Bloomberg Center on Roosevelt Island, and still others may imagine a city you spent time in on a Cornell abroad program. Cornell is all those places – but Cornell is not just places. Cornell is, at its core, people: it’s all of us. And although we’re currently dispersed throughout the world, we’re still hard at work learning, teaching and interacting with the world as Cornellians – and in so doing, moving the mission of our university forward. Even in this time of change and disruption, Cornell remains strong.</p>\n<p>I want to reiterate how impressed I have been by the determination and goodwill with which our entire community has risen to the extraordinary challenges of the past weeks: our students who have adjusted to an abrupt upending of their lives, our faculty who have poured so much energy into moving their courses online and our staff who have shown such extraordinary flexibility and dedication in carrying out the myriad tasks that are necessary to support our university. And I want to express, yet again, my tremendous respect for our friends and colleagues at Weill Cornell Medicine who are battling for the lives of so many under inconceivably difficult circumstances. They have our admiration and our thanks.</p>\n<p>I know that for many of you, the past few weeks have been traumatic. At this point, nearly all of us know someone who has been infected with COVID-19. Some of us have lost family members and friends; some have symptoms of the virus or confirmed diagnoses. Many are struggling with changes to financial and living situations. And all of us are worried: about our loved ones, about the economic consequences of this pandemic, about what will come next. In uncertain times, it can help to focus on what is in front of you, and what you can control: your interactions with others, your studies, the task at hand. I hope that each of you has been able to find some calm, some friendship and perhaps even some moments of laughter amid the ongoing turmoil.</p>\n<p>Many challenges lie ahead for us as a university and many decisions remain to be made. They will be difficult decisions, and they will be made at all levels of the university, from the leadership team working as a unit, to individual students, staff and faculty. Good decisions are made when they are guided by clear principles, and, to that end, the provost, the vice presidents and I have created a set of four principles, shaped by our core values, that we are using to guide us in decision-making.</p>\n<p>Caring for our students. We will do everything possible to enable all current and newly admitted students to complete their Cornell educations, despite the obstacles created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Family circumstances, financial resources and students’ lives will undoubtedly change in many ways. Working to see that all students have the financial resources they need is among our highest priorities. We also realize that financial concerns are not the only new stresses that students will face, and we aim to provide the support that our students will need to succeed academically and personally. Safeguarding our future as a world-class academic institution. We believe deeply in the value of Cornell’s exceptional academic community and will strive always to ensure that our scholarly enterprise is supported and thriving. Throughout its 155-year history, Cornell has defended truth, expanded knowledge and explored what it means to be human, while bringing its mission to the world through research and outreach. Through past wars, epidemics and economic downturns, Cornell continued to teach, continued to conduct world-class research, continued to engage and continued to adapt to a changing world. Cornell has endured the unprecedented before and will do so again. I believe deeply that, ultimately, we will emerge from this newest challenge even stronger. Maintaining our staffing. Cornell is Cornell because of our wonderful faculty and students, and because of our exceptional staff: our custodians, technicians, dining workers, office professionals and skilled trades and grounds staff, to name just a few. We are a community, and we will do everything we can to keep our community together. Even now, when everyone who can is sheltering in place, many of our dedicated staff are enabling students who could not go home to have a home at Cornell. Despite the challenges, they are coming in every day, keeping the lights on, the buildings warm and safe and the food ready. In addition, many of our staff have successfully moved to working remotely – by no means an easy undertaking in this difficult time. While I truly wish that I could say with certainty that there will be no furloughs or layoffs, there is, unfortunately, too much about the future that we simply do not know. What we do know is that when we make decisions about our collective future, the welfare of our employees will remain a critically important factor. Seeking new knowledge. It may seem incongruous to speak of seeking opportunities in the midst of crisis, but we are an educational institution. We are fundamentally about learning. And as we navigate through this time, we will pay attention to what we can learn along the way. We may learn about new ways of working remotely, we may learn about new ways of delivering education and we will undoubtedly find new ways to develop resilience in the face of the unprecedented.</p>\n<p>The road ahead will not be smooth, and it will not be easy. There will inevitably be decisions we will have to make that will shortchange one or another of our principles. But we will do our utmost to honor them.</p>\n<p>We may not all be together, but we are Cornell. Cornell is wherever you are. And together, we will keep Cornell strong.</p>\n<p>My best to all of you,</p>\n<p>Martha</p>","id":"5ee14dc8-7c12-590b-895d-034642f92098","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-cornell/2020-04-10-14_04_35/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus Updates"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.dartmouth.edu/sites/all/themes/dartmouth_base/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>March 30, 2020, Email Update</p>\n<p>To the Dartmouth community,</p>\n<p>I hope that everyone is safely settled in their locations as we work to fully launch our remote learning initiative this week. This major transformation of the delivery of our curriculum, almost unthinkable just a month ago, quietly and successfully got off the ground in several of our graduate programs last week and today expands across the undergraduate curriculum. Having seen all corners of the Dartmouth community come together these past weeks to support this effort and facilitate the continued education of our students has been nothing short of inspiring. We are so appreciative of the intensive and creative work that faculty and staff have devoted to this major transition, one among many shifts and changes we've had to accommodate this month. This commitment of our faculty and staff to engage individually with our students to support their learning is the hallmark of a Dartmouth education. The compassion for others that we have been seeing, and the entire community's flexibility and patience, are deeply valued and incredibly important in both our personal and professional lives as we continue to adapt to our new circumstances. I write now to provide updates on several emerging issues.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION</p>\n<p>A Dartmouth employee and an undergraduate student living on campus have tested presumptive positive for COVID-19. These individuals are resting comfortably and are in self-isolation and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services is conducting contact investigations in both cases. Three additional Dartmouth students are being tested for COVID-19 today. We are working closely with any student who develops symptoms of COVID-19 to ensure prompt self-isolation and notification and self-quarantine of close contacts. To date, four individuals on our campus have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, transmission of the virus in the Upper Valley is now prevalent. You can help to slow the spread of the disease by assuming that anyone you come in contact with may have COVID-19 and by maintaining social distancing, washing your hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoiding all gatherings. Given the current restrictions on domestic travel and the regional spread of the virus, visitors should not be coming to campus who are not authorized to be here. We continue to work closely with our partners at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and in our state and local governments to support the health care needs of the broader community.</p>\n<p>SUMMER TERM PROGRAMS CANCELED</p>\n<p>After carefully considering the many factors now affecting travel and study, and in consultation with members of the COVID-19 task force, we have made the decision to suspend all undergraduate international programs for the full summer term and all domestic summer term programs scheduled for the months of June and July. This includes all summer term study-abroad undergraduate programs, including language study abroad (LSA), foreign study programs (FSP), and exchange programs; and Dartmouth-supported leave-term programs such as internships, research grants, and fellowships. Students who are pursuing leave-term opportunities that can be fulfilled remotely or with an alternative set-up from their current location and requiring no air travel may request an exemption from this policy. This decision does not apply to programs run by the graduate and professional schools, and students will be notified by their respective school regarding decisions about such programs.</p>\n<p>Dartmouth-supported international and domestic travel remains prohibited for faculty and staff at this time with an option to apply for an exemption from your dean/supervisor. Personal travel, including domestic travel outside New Hampshire and Vermont, is strongly discouraged due to possible self-quarantine requirements upon arrival at your destination, following your return home, or both.</p>\n<p>We appreciate that these measures are both disappointing and frustrating, but they have been made to ensure the safety and well-being of our students and faculty. As always, we urge you to visit the Dartmouth COVID-19 website at <a href=\"https://dartmouth.edu/covid19\">https://dartmouth.edu/covid19</a> for updated information and helpful resources.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the data show that we are still in the earlier stages of this global pandemic. We are grateful for your help in keeping our community, and your communities wherever you are, as safe as possible in these extraordinary times.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Joseph Helble Provost</p>","id":"19d0b967-c5da-5312-8a76-a6a542efbc8d","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-dartmouth/2020-04-08-23_44_16/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"March 30, 2020, Email Update"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.dartmouth.edu/sites/all/themes/dartmouth_base/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<p>Information on the Hiring Freeze, April 4, 2020</p>\n<p>The Office of Human Resources has information on the COVID-19 hiring freeze. The HR site includes the process for requesting recruitment and review of a position thought to be of critical need. It also has an FAQ on the hiring freeze.</p>\n<p>Use of Face Coverings, April 4, 2020</p>\n<p>The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, for example grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. The CDC says that recent studies have shown that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms and even those who eventually develop symptoms can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. See the CDC FAQs on wearing face coverings.</p>\n<p>Out-of-State Quarantine for Those Returning to Campus and Visitors, April 1, 2020</p>\n<p>COVID-19 is now widespread throughout the world and within the United States. In accordance with CDC and New Hampshire state guidance, individuals traveling to campus from outside New Hampshire (including visitors and those returning from other locations) should self-quarantine for a period of 14 days off campus. This does not apply to individuals making same-day trips to New Hampshire for essential, authorized work on campus. All visitors to campus are subject to the same guidelines as members of the campus community (including as it relates to remote work). Given the risk of transmission and restrictions on travel, and to protect everyone's health, visitors who are not authorized to be at Dartmouth should not be coming to campus.</p>\n<p>Summer Off-Campus and Travel Update, March 30, 2020</p>\n<p>Dartmouth has made the decision to suspend all undergraduate international programs for the full summer term and all domestic summer term programs scheduled for the months of June and July. This includes all summer term study-abroad undergraduate programs, including language study abroad (LSA), foreign study programs (FSP), and exchange programs; and Dartmouth-supported leave-term programs such as internships, research grants, and fellowships. Students who are pursuing leave-term opportunities that can be fulfilled remotely or with an alternative set-up from their current location and requiring no air travel may request an exemption from this policy. This decision does not apply to programs run by the graduate and professional schools, and students will be notified by their respective school regarding decisions about such programs.</p>\n<p>Vermont/New Hampshire Stay-at-Home Update, March 27, 2020</p>\n<p>Recent emergency orders from N.H. Gov. Chris Sununu and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott restricting and minimizing activities outside of the home permit Dartmouth to continue its existing arrangements for core campus operations and remote teaching and working. The safety and wellbeing of our employees is our highest concern during this difficult time. Employees who have questions about their ability to work on campus should speak with their supervisor/manager about their concerns.</p>\n<p>Empathy and Inclusion Update, March 24, 2020</p>\n<p>During this difficult time, it is important to practice empathy and inclusion. No one is at a higher health risk because of their racial, ethnic, cultural, or other identity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Misinformation about COVID-19 can spark fear and hostility that hurts people and makes it difficult to stay healthy. We are stronger as a community when we stand together against discrimination and share information that we know to be factual. See the CDC website for suggestions on combating social stigma during this health crisis.</p>\n<p>Spring Term Changes, Update, March 17, 2020</p>\n<p>We have made the decision that all spring term classes, both undergraduate and graduate, will be conducted by remote learning for the full term. There will be no in-person option to attend classes on campus after May 1. This was a difficult decision that we know will be frustrating and disappointing for many of our students. Unfortunately, we are not alone. Across the country, many colleges and universities are taking similar steps in reducing the number of people on their campuses as a way to protect communities from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>We recognize that many students will have questions related to this transition to a full remote learning term, including financial questions. A group of administrators is working on further guidance related to billing and financial aid issues and will be in touch on this topic soon.</p>\n<p>Throughout the 10-week term the Dartmouth campus will remain open, faculty and staff⁠—including union employees—will be paid as usual, and graduate students will continue to receive their stipends.</p>\n<p>At the recommendation of the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Geisel School of Medicine has suspended all clinical rotations, effective today. This includes clerkships and electives.</p>\n<p>Tuck School of Business Spring Term, March 18, 2020</p>\n<p>The Tuck School of Business is moving all MBA courses to remote-only learning for the entire spring term, with no option for students to attend class in person. To the extent possible, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities will also be delivered remotely during this time.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Research Ramp-Down</p>\n<p>Like many of our peer institutions, Dartmouth has decided to ramp-down and pause on-campus research activities. Our goal is to minimize in-person contacts to limit the opportunities for the spread of the novel coronavirus, including interactions among our researchers, support staff, and the public. This is not a decision to cease research or scholarship at Dartmouth. However, beginning on Monday, March 23, research staff and students must perform their scholarly work remotely, unless an extension for on-campus work has been granted to use a laboratory. We will be working with all members of the academic and funding communities to minimize the negative impact on faculty, staff, and students, each of whom will receive further information later today regarding this decision from the vice provost for research.</p>\n<p>Faculty committee work, including tenure and promotion reviews and decisions, will continue to be conducted during spring term.</p>\n<p>Athletics</p>\n<p>The Ivy League presidents announced their unanimous decision to cancel all spring athletics competition and practices for the remainder of the academic year. In light of the pandemic, and the growing number of schools that have moved classes online for the rest of their semesters, it is no longer feasible for these competitions and practices to continue. This is a heavy blow to our student-athletes, who have sacrificed and trained so hard in their respective sports, and we regret the impact of these circumstances. The league also stated that winter teams and student-athletes who have qualified for postseason play will be able to participate in league competitions. However, the NCAA announced that all winter and spring championships have been canceled. Read the NCAA announcement.</p>\n<p>Social Distancing</p>\n<p>Social distancing means:</p>\n<p>Remaining away from settings where people are meeting</p>\n<p>Try to stay home and only go out for essentials reasons like food and medicine</p>\n<p>Avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately six feet) from others when possible</p>\n<p>Remain alert for respiratory symptoms (a cough or shortness of breath) and fever.</p>\n<p>Practice strict respiratory etiquette and hygiene. This includes covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap is not available.</p>\n<p>If you have traveled from or transited through an area with a CDC Travel Health Notice Level 1 or 2, you are required to self-observe for 14 days. Monitor your health and practice social distancing.</p>\n<p>If you feel feverish or develop a cough or shortness of breath, please seek health advice. Before going to a doctor's office or emergency room call ahead and tell the provider or office about your recent travel and symptoms. Students should contact Dartmouth College Health Service (Dick's House). Dick's House will monitor all students who should be in self-quarantine or self-isolation.</p>\n<p>Self-Quarantine for 14 Days</p>\n<p>Useful Definitions: Isolation and quarantine help protect the public by preventing exposure to people who have or may have a contagious disease.</p>\n<p>Isolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick.</p>\n<p>Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.</p>\n<p>After March 4, 2020, if you are returning from a country with a CDC Travel Health Notice Level 3, you are required to self-quarantine for 14 days in accordance with current Dartmouth guidance.</p>\n<p>Do not go to work or school for this 14-day period. Students should contact Dartmouth College Health Service (Dick's House).

In short, this will be a spring quarter and semester like no other, but our goal is to ensure that it’s fundamentally the same in many respects, and in spirit.</p>\n<p>Following are some of the specific policies and services that will shape this experience:</p>\n<p>Grading Policy</p>\n<p>With Drexel’s long history in online education — granting academic degrees for online programs as far back as the 1999-2000 academic year — we have an experienced and resourceful community committed to delivering high-quality courses and exams with academic integrity and rigor. After careful consideration, we will move forward with normal grading policies for both semester- and quarter-based programs, rather than a pass/fail model. We know some students have been denied the opportunity to finish their degrees on campus with their peers, so the last thing we want to do at this time is deny them the engaging learning experiences that drew them to Drexel in the first place.</p>\n<p>Tuition and Fees</p>\n<p>There will be no charges levied for on-campus housing or meal plans for students working from home or in off-campus residences. However, just as with online courses offered through Drexel University Online, normal tuition and fees will apply for the spring 2020 quarter — less any institutional scholarships and grants, or federal and state aid, which will be credited on student bills. We are working diligently over the extended spring break to develop engaging teaching and learning experiences to enable students to continue their studies. Fees, in turn, support the creation of a rich online learning experience, as well as other forms of digital interaction currently under development.</p>\n<p>Payment Options</p>\n<p>During this challenging time, Drexel will continue to offer several payment options to eligible students. These plans, which can be individualized to cover tuition and fee payments over the span of a term, are detailed on the Drexel Central website.</p>\n<p>Academic Advising</p>\n<p>Academic advisors within the colleges and schools are ready to work remotely with students, using Microsoft Teams and Zoom, in addition to corresponding by phone and email. Students can continue to schedule appointments with their academic advisors as before; scheduling appointment technology is available through the DrexelOne portal on the My Success Team Channel.</p>\n<p>Academic Support</p>\n<p>The Center for Learning and Academic Success Services (CLASS) is providing online academic coaching for all students. Appointments can be made via DrexelOne under the academics tab. For more information visit www.drexel.edu/class or email academicsuccess@drexel.edu. CLASS is offering a series of online workshops, including two workshops on tips for online and remote learning. The full list of workshops is available at this CLASS link. University-wide academic support services are also adapting services to deliver online tutoring and academic support. To learn more about these opportunities and accessibility, please visit the Learning Alliance.</p>\n<p>The Office of Disability Resources will continue to provide accommodations for students in the online sphere. Students should contact the office to renew their AVLs or to request any additional accommodations they need to be successful this spring. Faculty members looking for ways to accommodate students with disabilities also may reach out for support. Please contact disability@drexel.edu with questions or concerns.</p>\n<p>Student Counseling</p>\n<p>Counseling Center therapists are able to conduct teletherapy using a HIPPA-compliant, confidential Zoom platform to preserve students’ privacy. We will also be able to provide students within Pennsylvania and students residing across state lines with on-going support as licensing restrictions permit. Students who would like to schedule an appointment with a therapist can email counsel@drexel.edu or call 215.895.1415. An after-hours emergency line can be reached at 215.416.3337. Counseling Center staff also will be offering virtual workshops and other self-help modules, downloadable at the Center’s website. Another valuable digital resource we launched earlier this year, 7Cups , is available to all students who want to anonymously reach out for peer counseling. Finally, for students in recovery or seeking support around substance-use issues, the Haven is hosting virtual meetings every day at 8 p.m. EST at HavenRecoveryMeeting or by phone at 872.240.3412 (661-666-741 access code).</p>\n<p>Athletics and Recreation</p>\n<p>We are moving some of our athletics and recreational programming to a Virtual Rec Center. More information will soon be available. Some initial programs are spelled out and we will continue to expand the offerings. We anticipate having a robust group exercise schedule (mainly on Instagram), eSports tournaments, and other programs that our students and employees will suggest.</p>\n<p>Student Engagement</p>\n<p>We will continue to support our 300-plus student organizations by moving our organization processes and supports online, including student organization recognition, student organization advisement for event planning and operations, officer training, and student organization funding (SAFAC). The Student Center for Diversity and Inclusion, as well as many of our key student organizations (USGA, fraternity and sorority councils) are moving meetings and programming to digital platforms. Check DragonLink for updates.</p>\n<p>As always, please continue to check Drexel’s Response to Coronavirus website for the latest updates, and utilize the CDC's prevention tips.</p>\n<p>Even as we are being challenged to live and learn in new ways by this pandemic, we can be reassured that Drexel will continue to carry out its mission of teaching, research and service. Please take care of yourselves, and each other, in the days and weeks ahead. And we’ll look forward to everyone’s return to Drexel’s virtual campus in less than two weeks’ time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>John Fry</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Helen Y.

While all around us the nation faces a time of uncertainty, we can be sure that, on our virtual campus, the next two-and-a-half months will prove to be productive in so many ways. We may be apart from one another as we shelter from the COVID-19 coronavirus, but we can still share this moment as a community. And I’m confident that we will emerge with our personal connections strengthened, our studies and research fruitful, and our service to the community as impactful as ever.</p>\n<p>It all starts Monday. Drexel faculty and professional staff are eager to welcome you back — as they show in this video. Before the first day is out, professors and their students will have gathered online for more than 750 course sessions previously scheduled in traditional classrooms and labs. By week’s end, they will be followed by several thousand online sessions, amounting to approximately 3,250 instructional meetings. And on and on, throughout the nine-week term.</p>\n<p>With Drexel’s online teaching dating back to 1996, we are leaders in the field. And now those skills will benefit the entire Drexel community. However, we recognize the difficult situation faced by many students, having had to move off campus abruptly and return home amid a great deal of uncertainty and disruption in their lives. In an effort to assist our students, we have decided to offer the option to take spring term courses on a pass/fail basis. Details will be provided in a separate message to students next week. (It’s important to note that the pass/fail option does not apply to students in the School of Education, or to those in the clinical portion of the MD program, due to accreditation requirements.)</p>\n<p>The challenge of moving an entire curriculum online in only a matter of weeks has been daunting. But we can take pride in the fact that our faculty, with support from professional staff, have done it while managing their own stress — and even explored creating new courses of study directly related to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>While students hopefully will find this term as rewarding and challenging as any taught in a classroom setting, Drexel researchers are mounting studies remotely to advance knowledge and benefit society — including ways to combat the coronavirus. Research related to COVID-19 is being conducted in colleges and schools across the University, from fast-tracking production of medical masks, to gaining insights on vaccines, to developing new educational online platforms.</p>\n<p>We’re also staying in touch with our community. For instance, the Dornsife Center for Neighborhood Partnerships is conducting video sessions for area residents who need help with information on job searches, unemployment claims, completing Census forms, and other challenges and concerns.</p>\n<p>This spring, many students also are turning their attention to their co-op experience. Steinbright Career Development Center advisors are working with students applying for positions, as well as being in talks with current co-op employers to arrange remote work options and, in some cases, delaying the start of co-ops. It’s the sort of innovative work we would expect with the Drexel co-op, now marking its 100th anniversary.</p>\n<p>And just as students and faculty on campus would take time off from their studies to relax and perhaps drop in to the DAC, they will find more than two dozen online exercise classes held weekly as part of the Virtual Rec Center created by Drexel Athletics. University fitness instructors will be available to conduct group exercise sessions to help all of us stay strong throughout the term.</p>\n<p>Finally, we are deeply grateful for the continued generosity of the Drexel community. Alumni, trustees and other supporters have contributed more than $145,000 to help students meet emergency expenses, and over $110,000 to back research into COVID-19.</p>\n<p>As always, please continue to check Drexel’s Response to Coronavirus website for updates and utilize the CDC's prevention tips.</p>\n<p>Please take care of yourselves, and each other. I wish each of you the very best for the coming weeks and months and look forward to the time when we can gather again on campus.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>John Fry</p>\n<p>President</p>","id":"2a8fcd57-6c65-52f4-8331-0a356faba090","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-drexel/2020-04-10-14_03_35/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome Back to the Future of Drexel University"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://embed.widencdn.net/img/du/8b8xa6hcbv/4000x2527px/DU-campus-mtns-hero-crop.jpg\"></p>\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel coronavirus not previously been seen in humans.

I will also be sharing this information with your parents and guardians. Here is what you and your family can expect:</p>\n<p>Reversal of room and board charges for those students who have moved out of DU housing;</p>\n<p>Reversal of student activity fee and student health and counseling fee (to be prorated for Sturm College of Law students);</p>\n<p>Reversal of these charges may create a credit balance in the student account for those who have already paid these charges;</p>\n<p>Credit balances created by the reversals will be refunded to students;</p>\n<p>Financial aid and scholarships, including the residence hall grant, will not change; a few students (athletes, Boettcher scholars) may have scholarship adjustments based on an award that is specific to room and board costs;</p>\n<p>Tuition charges for the spring term will remain unchanged.</p>\n<p>The University has begun processing the refunds for housing and meal plans as well as the activity and health fees. Students and authorized users can log onto DUPay to check the status of refunded charges and will receive an email when a refund has been added to their account.</p>\n<p>Our Commitment to High-Quality Spring Course Offerings</p>\n<p>I want to assure you that although the need for physical distancing is affecting the way we will deliver coursework for the spring term, we will not compromise on our commitment to maintain low student-faculty ratios and to deliver rich engagement in experiential learning opportunities. Our Sturm College of Law faculty have begun teaching online without a break. I am encouraged and excited by the innovative ways in which our faculty are working quickly and effectively to replicate their world-class teaching through digital means. As they prepare for spring quarter, they are being aided by a number of remote and online teaching resources, as well as through one-on-one consultations and seminars. We are very dedicated to finding creative ways for you to stay connected and maximize your experience during this unique situation.</p>\n<p>Online Orientation to be Held the First Week of Classes</p>\n<p>During the first week of the 10-week quarter, each faculty member will host online orientation sessions to help you acclimate to the virtual learning experience. While each course offers different challenges and opportunities, our commitment to your success persists, and we will continue to provide robust levels of responsiveness and support. Academic advising and career counseling will be offered remotely and remain as important as ever.</p>\n<p>One Week Extension for Add/Drop Period</p>\n<p>We have also extended the add/drop period to two weeks to give you more time to make changes to your course selection. For the spring quarter, the new deadline is April 12. If you withdraw (W) from a course within this window, you will receive a full refund. Thereafter, your tuition refund will be prorated, and you will receive a W notation on your transcript. For undergraduates on a flat rate that are taking 12-18 hours, if you drop a class and your course load stays within the same range, your tuition will remain the same. Advisors are available to support you in making these decisions: [email protected].</p>\n<p>Commencement Decisions Still to Come</p>\n<p>For our graduating students, commencement is one of their primary concerns, as it is the culminating experience of their college years. Currently, the spring undergraduate ceremony is scheduled for June 13, and the graduate ceremony is scheduled for June 12. The Sturm College of Law has not yet decided whether its graduation ceremony can take place in mid-May. We do not know when things will return to normal and we will keep you informed as we learn more. We will obviously respect the guidance of health officials but as it stands now, we have not cancelled these special milestone events. We will make a final decision about the June ceremonies no later than May 1, and we will continue to be guided by what is best for our students, our families, and the broader community. I expect there will be a decision about the Sturm College of Law ceremony in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>HCC Continues to Provide Telehealth Services</p>\n<p>Importantly, the Health &#x26; Counseling Center (HCC) will remain open for the spring quarter and will continue to offer telehealth services throughout the quarter. The health fee refund for spring quarter will not affect HCC’s operations.</p>\n<p>Medical and Mental Health Resources</p>\n<p>Medical and mental health support will also continue remotely providing you with suggestions and resources on how to stay well despite the challenges of physical isolation. Campus Life staff, along with student leaders, are considering new ways to build community—ensuring that physical isolation does not lead to social isolation. We are deeply committed to ensuring you receive what you need from the University of Denver to continue and complete your education.</p>\n<p>Our Dedication to the Public Good</p>\n<p>Finally, as a University dedicated to the public good, we urge you all to take your responsibility for the public good seriously. This means all of us need to be thinking seriously about our behavior, actions, and choices in the coming weeks. You should be physically distancing, whether you are on campus, living in the neighborhood, or home with your families. You should not be traveling. You should pay careful attention to the health care professionals and scientists and consider what you can do to help flatten the steep curve of coronavirus cases in our country. We all need to do our part right now.</p>\n<p>I believe we will get through these challenging times and emerge stronger. This past week our faculty and students demonstrated remarkable resilience and flexibility as everyone pivoted quickly to online exams. I have never been more impressed by the courage and character of our DU students than during this very challenging and stressful time.</p>\n<p>I wish you and your loved ones a healthy spring break and we look forward to welcoming you to DU’s virtual campus next week.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jeremy Haefner</p>\n<p>Chancellor</p>","id":"194b9f69-3ba5-59fc-975d-a4ededb6f652","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-du/2020-04-08-23_36_48/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Student Update: Coronavirus - March 22, 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://embed.widencdn.net/img/du/8b8xa6hcbv/4000x2527px/DU-campus-mtns-hero-crop.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Dear faculty,</p>\n<p>I write to provide updates on time-sensitive questions about your professional timeline and your spring courses.

This will include all study abroad programs, experiential travel, and other group travel for students and faculty. By making this decision now, our academic units will be in a better position to plan alternate academic opportunities that also benefit students. It will also allow our students the chance to consider other options if they had been planning an international experience this summer.</p>\n<p>Further, we are strongly recommending that all non-essential international and domestic employee travel be avoided until June 30.</p>\n<p>Recommendations about fall study abroad programs will be shared towards the end of April since course registrations for fall quarter begin in early May.</p>\n<p>We will continue to re-evaluate this travel policy and all related academic decisions, as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

Kornbluth, Provost</p>\n<p>In light of the continuing uncertainty about our ability to safely conduct programming on campus over the next several months, Duke will be implementing the following changes for all university-sponsored summer programs:</p>\n<p>Summer Session I classes scheduled for the Duke Campus and the Duke Marine Lab are cancelled. We are currently exploring the feasibility of offering a reduced set of remote or online courses in Summer I (May 13-June 25) and will announce those options when they can be confirmed. We have not made a final determination about Summer Session II (June 29-Aug 9 but plan to do so by the end of April. We hope circumstances will have changed enough to safely operate a limited schedule of classes; otherwise we will continue to plan a slate of remote or online offerings for Summer Session II. Since many Duke undergraduates rely on Summer Session I and II to meet academic requirements, our highest priority will be to ensure that those courses remain available to the extent possible.</p>\n<p>All other Duke-sponsored academic curricular and co-curricular programs scheduled for the entire summer must be delivered remotely or online. No campus-based programming or classes will be permitted.</p>\n<p>All Duke-sponsored academic programs involving travel are cancelled for the entire summer. This includes, but is not limited to, GEO-managed study abroad, Duke Engage, and any programs offered by graduate and professional schools. Student participation in summer study abroad programs offered by non-Duke providers must abide by Duke travel policies.</p>\n<p>All Duke-sponsored summer programs enrolling pre-college students (minors), except the American Dance Festival and sports camps scheduled for Duke campus and offsite locations, are cancelled for the entire summer. This includes, but is not limited to, Duke TIP, pre-college programs run by Continuing Studies, individual schools and units, and the Office of Durham and Community Affairs, as well as any Duke student-run activities. We anticipate delivering a limited set of pre-college programs remotely or online. Further details will be forthcoming from each program.</p>\n<p>Sports camps, the American Dance Festival and all non-credit classes, programs, camps, festivals, and activities sponsored by outside organizations that are schedule to be held on the Duke campus are cancelled through at least June 28, 2020. We will make a decision by the end of April regarding programs scheduled to be held after June 28.</p>\n<p>Individuals who have already registered and paid for cancelled programs will receive a full refund of any deposits or fees that have been paid. We expect that many schools and programs that are unable to operate on campus will develop alternatives that could provide educational and employment opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at Duke, as well as the many individuals from around the world who have come to rely on Duke summer programs.</p>\n<p>We are assembling a leadership working group to support the development and delivery of curricular, co-curricular, and career programs for Duke undergraduate and graduate students. We will also widely disseminate summer opportunities through a dedicated website that will be available shortly.</p>\n<p>Curtailing summer programming is a difficult but necessary decision given the current uncertainty about the safe resumption of campus activities. We know it will present some level of disruption and stress for students, families, faculty and staff, but we also know that many of our programs will use this moment to conceive and execute innovative programs that continue our mission of education, research and service.</p>","id":"a7229a19-f6c5-5e99-8312-32188bdaf0e0","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-duke/2020-04-08-23_40_38/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Changes for Duke Summer Programs"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://coronavirus.duke.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ms-icon-310x310-1-88x88.png\"></p>\n<p>This email was sent to all undergraduate students on March 18, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Duke Students,</p>\n<p>The unprecedented challenges imposed by COVID-19 require us to consider novel ways to support the curricular efforts of our undergraduate students and faculty. This is a moment that has been characterized by widespread anxiety, uncertainty, social, and geographic disruption. As academic leaders of this great university, we believe that bold action is necessary to maximize undergraduates’ curricular engagement.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, during Spring 2020, we will transition all courses to a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) grading option, but allow undergraduates the opportunity of receiving a letter grade.</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, Spring 2020 courses will transition to a default S/U grading option. If you choose to receive a letter grade for any class, you can indicate so by submitting a form to the registrar’s office no later than April 22 at 5:00 pm EST. You can find the form here: <a href=\"https://registrar.duke.edu/forms/su-graded\">https://registrar.duke.edu/forms/su-graded</a>.</p>\n<p>Moreover:</p>\n<p>Courses taken for S/U grades during Spring 2020 will count towards curricular, major, continuation, and graduation requirements.</p>\n<p>A grade of S (satisfactory) will be awarded if you earn the equivalent of a letter grade of C- or higher.</p>\n<p>Grades of S and U are not factored into your grade point average.</p>\n<p>This policy does not apply to 500/600-level courses. These courses are subject to graduate-level grading policies. More detail about these courses will follow.</p>\n<p>Given this shift, we will suspend the Dean’s List for the Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>Duke will include a designation on undergraduate students’ transcripts, indicating the extraordinary circumstances encountered in the present semester.</p>\n<p>We expect that this strategy will ease the necessary transitions into remote course delivery and promote strong engagement throughout this most extraordinary phase of Duke’s history.</p>\n<p>Best wishes for a healthy, fulfilling, and intellectually stimulating semester.</p>\n<p>Go Duke!</p>\n<p>Sally Kornbluth, Provost</p>\n<p>Valerie Ashby, Dean, Trinity College of Arts &#x26; Sciences</p>\n<p>Ravi Bellamkonda, Dean, Pratt School of Engineering</p>\n<p>Gary Bennett, Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education</p>\n<p>Jennifer Francis, Executive Vice Provost</p>\n<p>Judith Kelley, Dean, Sanford School of Public Policy</p>\n<p>Mary Pat McMahon, Vice Provost/Vice President Student Affairs</p>\n<p>Toddi Steelman, Dean, Nicholas School of the Environment</p>","id":"b40e6a7c-ce34-5782-9b49-ddfb43819437","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-duke/2020-04-08-23_40_41/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Undergraduate Grading Policy Changes"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://coronavirus.duke.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ms-icon-310x310-1-88x88.png\"></p>\n<p>This message was sent by email to all international students on March 14, 2020. It is also included in the FAQ at <a href=\"https://keeplearning.duke.edu/\">https://keeplearning.duke.edu/</a></p>\n<p>Dear International Students:</p>\n<p>We know that this is a stressful time for you and we want to provide as much support and guidance as we can. Please know that we are closely monitoring developments related to visa issues and will communicate with you as we learn about policies. In the meantime, we hope that the following information will be helpful to you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Q- As an F-1 or J-1 student, I am only allowed to take one online course per semester, how does Duke’s decision to allow me to take all courses online affect my visa status?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- The Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which governs the international student population, has recognized that most colleges and universities are transitioning to online instruction and has temporarily relaxed restrictions on online coursework. Students will be able to temporarily pursue online courses full-time inside or outside the U.S. until Duke University determines it is safe to resume classes on campus.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Q- If I return to my home country and complete my courses online, will my F-1 SEVIS file remain open?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- Yes, you can complete your courses online. As long as you remain enrolled as a full-time student, we will not close or terminate your SEVIS file. Your situation would be similar to a Study Abroad student who started coursework in the U.S. and completed it outside the U.S. Keeping your SEVIS file open will allow you to reenter the U.S. as a F-1 student.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Q- I heard I cannot be outside the country for more than 5 months or I will lose my F-1 status. Is this true?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- The 5-month absence rule only applies if you are no longer a Duke student due to the termination of your SEVIS record. If you are outside the U.S. 5 months or more after your SEVIS record was terminated, you lose your ability to reenter as a F-1 student. We must issue a new I-20 with a new SEVIS number. If that happens, your F-1 status will restart, which may affect your ability to request employment authorization in the U.S. WE WILL NOT CLOSE YOUR SEVIS FILE IF YOU ARE ENROLLED AS A FULL-TIME STUDENT ONLINE AND YOU INTEND TO RETURN AFTER THE CRISIS OR IN FALL 2020.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Q- What about the visa in my passport? Will it expire after 5 months?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- The visa in your passport will NOT expire as long as you are enrolled full-time online during the Spring term because you still have a connection to your Duke academic program. Remember to check your visa to verify it is a multiple entry visa and has an expiration date AFTERyou reenter the U.S. If it was a single entry visa, you must request a new visa before returning to the U.S. If you have a two-entry visa, the visa is only valid for two entries before the expiration date.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Q- I prefer to return home to complete my semester online but my visa has expired. What do I do?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- If your visa has expired, you must request a new visa before you reenter the U.S. Detailed information about the visa process can be found on our website.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Q- I will graduate in May 2020 and would like to apply for Post-Graduation Optional Practical Training (OPT). Can I still do so?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- Yes, you can still apply for OPT. We recommend that you apply before you leave the U.S. We cannot assist you after you physically leave the U.S. because you will not have an I-94 showing you are in the U.S. Further details on Post-Graduation Optional Practical Training can be found on our website.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Q- I will not graduate in May 2020 and have received an internship for the summer. What options do I have to reenter the U.S. receive employment authorization?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- Your choices are Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training or Curricular Practical Training. The processing time for Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training is anywhere from 3 to 4 months. If you have not already applied, there is a very low likelihood you will receive approval for the summer. If you qualify for Curricular Practical Training and receive an internship, we cannot process the approval while you are outside the U.S., but if you send our office the required information when you reenter the U.S. and send us a copy of your I-94, we will be able to process Curricular Practical Training approval.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Q- I filed for Pre- or Post-Graduation Optional Practical Training, and I plan to leave the U.S. How will I receive the Practical Training approval card?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- The Duke Visa Services Office will contact you with instructions. We will mail the the card to you when it arrives.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Q- What if I want to stay on campus because I cannot leave the U.S.?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- If you are presently on campus and cannot return home, whether due to travel restrictions, costs of travel, or another consideration that may supersede this direction, you must complete the housing registration form. Student Affairs staff will follow up with you directly to learn more. Detailed information can be found at Update for All Students in Residence Halls.</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Q- Can I stay in the U.S. through the end of the Spring 2020 semester – but not on the Duke campus – and not return to Duke for the duration of the crisis after the semester ends?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- You must be enrolled in a full-time schedule of Duke online classes to remain in the U.S. If you relocate within the U.S., then you must update your address in DukeHub so we can notify the Student and Exchange Visitor Program of your new location. IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PURSUE FULL-TIME DUKE ONLINE COURSES AFTER THE END OF THE SPRING 2020 SEMESTER, YOU WILL NOT BE IN A VALID F-1 STATUS AND MUST LEAVE THE U.S.</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>Q- Duke has restrictions on travel to certain countries. What is the update on this issue?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- Duke has restrictions on university-funded or sponsored travel. However, personal travel is permitted. There is additional guidance on this issue at: <a href=\"https://coronavirus.duke.edu/events-travel/\">https://coronavirus.duke.edu/events-travel/</a>.</p>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li>Q- I have additional questions about visas. Whom do I contact?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A- Email visahelp@mc.duke.edu and an advisor will assist you or call Duke Visa Services at 919-681-8472.</p>","id":"9b5fa349-4a7d-54a0-8ac1-a4aec0f3a45f","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-duke/2020-04-08-23_40_44/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New information for international students"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://coronavirus.duke.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ms-icon-310x310-1-88x88.png\"></p>\n<p>Dear students and parents,</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience as we worked through the questions related to housing, dining and work arrangements which arose when we had to curtail quickly and limit campus services on the Duke campus in March. These shifts have impacted students in different ways.</p>\n<p>Toward this goal, we want to advise you of several specific actions we are taking regarding housing and dining fees and student employment:</p>\n<p>HOUSING: First-year, sophomore and junior Duke students who lived in on-campus housing prior to March 13 will receive a credit to their Fall 2020 semester bill for the prorated portion of Spring semester housing costs covering the period March 13-May 10. This credit will reduce the cost of on-campus housing for Fall 2020. Students graduating this semester will receive a refund instead of a credit. If you are not graduating this semester and do not return to campus housing next year, we will refund at that time.</p>\n<p>DINING: Students who had a Spring 2020 dining plan will receive a credit to the Fall 2020 semester for the unused portion of their dining account. Students who receive need-based financial aid through the university will receive an immediate payment equal to the amount of unused dining funds. Graduating students with eligible plans will receive a refund equal to the amount of unused dining funds.</p>\n<p>STUDENT EMPLOYMENT: Students who are employed by Duke should contact your supervisor to determine if you can continue to work remotely. If you are able to do so, please report your hours as normal and you will continue to be paid, via direct deposit, on the standard bi-weekly schedule. If you are not able to work remotely, Duke will continue to pay you based on the schedule that was in place before Spring Break. These electronic payments will be made regardless of the type of employment (i.e., federal work study, Duke work-study or Duke employment). Estimated payments via payroll may require a lag of one pay period. If you are not already set up for direct deposit, please enroll using Duke@Work (work.duke.edu).</p>\n<p>REFUNDS: The easiest way for Duke to provide you with a refund is through direct deposit, which allows for an electronic deposit to a US-based bank account that you specify. If you have not already provided a bank account, please follow the instructions below:</p>\n<p>Log on to the DukeHub Click on the “Forms &#x26; Requests” tab Add or manage your direct deposit information</p>\n<p>For those students without a bank account, a refund check will be mailed to your home address as shown on DukeHub. Please check this information to make sure it is up-to-date.</p>\n<p>President Price has recently established a new Duke Student Assistance Fund to provide support for extraordinary expenses and needs that may have come up as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. We will be communicating very soon to undergraduate, graduate and professional students regarding the potential uses of these funds and how you can request support from that fund.</p>\n<p>Further information will be available starting Monday, April 6th at duke.edu/studentassistance.

Six COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in the state.</li>\n<li>There has been one confirmed COVID-19 case in the Elon University community – the study abroad student reported last weekend who is recuperating at home. We also have one presumptive positive case, a student who is in isolation. That individual does not live in university-owned housing, has not been on campus, and was not in contact with any other student, faculty, or staff member during the possible period of contagion.</li>\n<li>North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has announced a <a href=\"https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO121-Stay-at-Home-Order-3.pdf\">stay-at-home executive order</a> effective at 5 p.m. today, Monday, March 30, and extending for the next 30 days. Students who live on or near campus should not leave their residences except to get food, medicine or necessary supplies; exercise outdoors; to take care of others in need or do volunteer service; or to perform other essential functions outlined in the executive order.</li>\n<li>Consistent with that executive order, Elon facilities are closed to walk-in traffic, and most services are operating remotely or by appointment. Faculty and staff members are working remotely, unless they are providing essential services for the campus and the students who were unable to leave due to personal circumstances. <strong>Nonessential staff remote work arrangements will be automatically extended through the end of the executive order (currently scheduled for April 29)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Essential services available on campus will continue to  include to-go meals at Lakeside Dining Hall (hours and menu <a href=\"https://www.elondining.com/menu-hours/\">here</a>), Student Health Services (hours and appointment information <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/u/health-wellness/health-services/\">here</a>), Moseley Center and Mail Services (Monday-Friday, 10 a.m.-2 p.m.), and two computer labs (Alamance 315 and Steers Pavilion) available by card access from 6 a.m.-midnight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important announcements</strong></p>\n<p>As university leaders, we have taken a measured and thoughtful approach to decision-making about the impact of this situation on our academic semester. Elon’s approach has been to monitor facts, federal and state directives, and data about the spread of the virus to make decisions about the best way to complete the semester in a healthy and safe manner. Now that North Carolina’s governor has issued a stay-at-home directive until the end of April, we are announcing the following decisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remote instruction for undergraduate courses will continue for the duration of the semester, including final exams.</strong> The semester will proceed according to the <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/u/academic-calendar/\">undergraduate academic calendar</a>, with courses concluding Tuesday, May 12 and final exams taking place <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/u/academic-calendar/\">as scheduled</a> from May 13 through 19. Graduate and law programs will announce changes to course delivery directly to the affected faculty and students.  It will take some time for faculty members to make changes to course schedules and timelines and students are asked to be patient as those alterations are made.</li>\n<li>In order to protect the health and safety of students and families during the ongoing pandemic , it has become clear that <strong>we must postpone undergraduate Commencement activities until we can gather safely as a community</strong>.  While diplomas will be conferred officially on the original date of May 22, we are committed to ensuring that the Class of 2020 and their families celebrate graduation together on campus. In the coming weeks, we will share the new date and plans for Commencement 2020 and will continue to involve the senior class officers. This afternoon, the <strong>graduate programs in higher education, interactive media and business</strong> will communicate directly with their students about plans for graduate Commencement ceremonies.</li>\n<li>The <strong>residence hall move-out process will be extended until May 31</strong> , to also coincide with the end of leases for the university-owned apartments. Residence Life will be communicating directly with residents and their families in the coming weeks about a process to commence after the stay-at-home directive has been lifted. Students who wish to retrieve items or check out of the facilities before that information has been announced should update their plans in the housing portal, <a href=\"http://www.elon.edu/myhousing\">www.elon.edu/myhousing</a>.</li>\n<li>As we mentioned in last week’s update email, the university is developing policies and protocols to <strong>allow undergraduate students residing on campus to request prorated credits</strong> on housing and/or meal plan costs. Details of those arrangements will be announced as soon as they are complete.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous announcements and information are archived on the university’s coronavirus website, <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.elon.edu/coronavirus</a>.

I congratulate you for rising to the challenge! As we continue to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, the challenge of offering courses online continues, at least for the first summer sessions.</p>\n<p>If you plan to teach this summer, I strongly encourage you to incorporate as many asynchronous components in your teaching as you are able (whenever possible, not requiring students to be online for a set meeting time) to allow more flexibility for your remote learners. There are several good reasons for this approach.</p>\n<p>As I’m sure many of you have already experienced, internet connectivity can be unstable depending upon time of day and location. Keeping to scheduled class times may be difficult, if not impossible, for many of our students due to the competing demands of caregiver responsibilities, living in different time zones, and possibly contending with illness. Incorporating more asynchronous teaching methods maximizes access and flexibility at a time when our students need it most. You can make use of synchronous class times to promote discussion and group activities. Some instructors find that pre-recording lecture material in Kaltura, for example, then using Zoom to hold synchronous office hours or review/study sessions, can provide the direct contact that supports engagement. These real-time interactions are an important component of quality online instruction and help keep students connected during the season of remote learning.</p>\n<p>If you are planning to teach this summer, I urge you to incorporate asynchronous elements and reach out to the Office of Distance Learning or the Center for the Advancement of Teaching for resources and assistance.</p>\n<p>Office of Distance Learning (ODL): ODL provides guidance to faculty designing online courses. They can help you make your course more resilient, address the time and distance challenges of your students, and incorporate strategies to engage your students and increase the quality of your remote teaching.

You might try Reverse Office Hours: instead of waiting for students to come to you, write as many as you can individually and ask them about a project or recall a good interchange you had with them or comment on something they wrote or even inquire about a personal detail only you know about. Years from now, they’ll remember you did that.</p>\n<p>Making contact in this intentional way would be personally meaningful for each student you reach; even more important, perhaps, it might help a student in difficult circumstances decide to persist rather than giving up on the semester, so if you can’t get in touch with everyone, this is a great time to reach out to those who seem to be struggling. Getting a sense of our students’ new life circumstances can also help us make more informed and compassionate decisions about our teaching. We can all strive to first “do no harm” by eliminating obstacles for our students. For example, synchronous class sessions may be impossible for some to attend now. Others may not have access to or proficiency with certain tech tools. We can help our students instead by building as much flexibility and accessibility into our courses as possible; by communicating clear instructions and expectations; and by ensuring that the workload we’ve assigned is reasonable.</p>\n<p>Assigning a manageable workload may be easier said than done, though. As we shift what would have been both in- and out-of-class work online, estimating how much time it will take for students to do each task may be challenging. In many instances, the work we’re asking them to complete in place of class time is actually more effortful or time-consuming than attendance, and students feel that their courses are suddenly requiring “extra” work. Even in normal circumstances, instructors often gravely underestimate how much time it will take students to read complex texts, solve problems, write papers, or make videos. Assigning work is one of the places where our expert blind spots trip us up. We forget what it’s like to be a novice, for whom each step takes conscious effort, and we accidentally deplete students’ cognitive bandwidth. We may also simply demand more time than they have to give.</p>\n<p>The CTE at Rice University developed a calculator to help estimate the amount of time the tasks you assign are likely to take students to complete. Especially now, when students are fearful and distracted, we need to avoid imposing “busy work,” or piling on challenges. Instead we can focus on helping students make the most of the time they spend on the course. We can do that best by reminding ourselves of our priorities for student learning. What should they be able to do because they’ve taken this course? What should they master? What’s most important? And what do they need to practice? If you’d like some support as you prioritize, please reach out.</p>\n<p>Several colleagues have asked how CAT will continue to provide support for teaching now that most of us are working remotely, so we wanted to share our plan with you. The following is a list of most of our regular services and the methods we will use to continue to provide them.

We have sought to respond in the best ways we are capable—seeking to protect our community and to ensure the strongest possible framework for the pursuit of knowledge and learning.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, we announced that we would extend our virtual learning environment through the end of the semester, to include final exams. Since that time, additional guidance has been released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on community gatherings that further reinforces our decision and causes us to look to extend our review of activities to the period of Commencement.</p>\n<p>After careful consideration, we have made the determination that it will be necessary to postpone Commencement activities to a time in which we can safely convene as a community.</p>\n<p>For each Georgetown student, the experience of Commencement represents the culmination of years of work and significant academic achievement. Commencement provides all of us with a way to gather to recognize the achievements of our students and their contributions to the life of our community.

We deeply appreciate faculty and staff’s commitment to attend not only to the academic needs, but also to the considerable psychosocial, emotional and material needs of students.</p>\n<p>With these varied needs in mind, we write now to remind faculty that it is our collective responsibility to ensure students have equal opportunity to access our academic spaces. The university is deeply committed to supporting this effort. Access challenges affect a broad swath of our community and range from the need for new or different academic accommodations for students with disabilities and learning differences, to disparities in access to technology, to new responsibilities for dependent care.</p>\n<p>Over the past two weeks, a collaboration of students from Georgetown Disability Alliance, staff from the Academic Resource Center (ARC), CNDLS, UIS and the Office of Equity and Inclusion have worked together to identify the most pressing accessibility problems emerging in our virtual learning environments and gather a set of resources to respond to them. These resources are guided by the principles of Universal Design for Learning, a research-based model that aims to build more inclusive learning environments through giving students multiple ways to connect with course content and to demonstrate what they’ve learned.</p>\n<p>We are pleased to announce that these resources are now available to all faculty on the Instructional Continuity website under Accessibility. Additionally, students will have access to accessibility resources via Canvas beginning next week on their course dashboard. Finally, we invite faculty to register for a webinar on accommodations co-hosted by CNDLS and the ARC that will take place on Wednesday, April 8 at 11 a.m. The webinar will be recorded and made available on the Instructional Continuity website as well. Faculty can register at this link. We urge that you make use of these resources as we engage in our collective responsibility of advancing access.</p>\n<p>The global crisis and its effects on our community are evolving on a daily basis, demanding new forms of collaboration and support for one another.

A number of students and faculty, in groups and individually, have shared the difficulties and fears experienced as a result of the transition to remote learning. We continue to be deeply moved by the ways in which members of our community are supporting each other.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your feedback in response to the revised grading scale of the Pass/Fail option shared previously. I have heard from many faculty as well on this topic. The Main Campus Executive Faculty (MCEF) Steering Committee and Deans have taken into consideration the diverse responses received about the grading policy. There is large variation in attitudes among faculty and students on these issues. For the clarity of student and faculty work during the few weeks remaining in the term, however, a timely decision is needed.</p>\n<p>After reviewing all the alternative proposals forwarded, the MCEF Steering Committee and the School Deans have liberalized the Pass/Fail option for Spring, 2020. This protocol is the final decision on the grading policy for the spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>The framework addresses many factors leading to this decision: ensuring the University academic calendar complies with federal regulations; taking into account the important voices we heard from students, faculty, and families; rightfully recognizing the unequal hardships faced by some students after moving to an online environment; and valuing the academic performance of students in the first portion of the semester.</p>\n<p>For the Spring 2020 term:</p>\n<p>Students (graduate and undergraduate) will have the option to choose one of two grading frameworks, either:</p>\n<p>(1) a letter grade, or</p>\n<p>(2) Satisfactory (S); Credit (CR); or No-credit(NC): (S = grades A through C; CR = C-, D+, D; NC = F)</p>\n<p>(1) a letter grade, or (2) Satisfactory (S); Credit (CR); or No-credit(NC): (S = grades A through C; CR = C-, D+, D; NC = F) Students can make this choice in MyAccess beginning on April 6 up until the last day of classes.</p>\n<p>The choice to take a class S/CR/NC can apply to any course: Core, major, minor, certificate or free elective.</p>\n<p>The choice can be made without permission from the deans (per the usual process). Requests by graduate students in programs that have opted into the policy must be approved by the appropriate director of graduate studies or dean.</p>\n<p>The S/CR/NC options will not be counted toward the stated maximum of student’s degree programs (e.g., “six” as outlined in the Undergraduate Bulletin).</p>\n<p>The withdrawal date will also be extended to the last day of classes. Late withdrawal is only available to graduate students in programs that have opted in to the policy.</p>\n<p>A transcript notation will explain that S/CR/NC was instituted because of the Spring 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>This grading policy will be in place for the Spring 2020 term only and is in response to the mid-semester transition to virtual learning due to the COVID-19 situation.</p>\n<p>In our decision-making we were guided by a compassionate consideration of students who are suffering under the conditions of dislocation due to the pandemic and are unable to work or perform at the same level they were before. Through the addition of CR, students who might slip into the C-, D+, and D range are assured of passing and of not having to repeat a course. The NC designation means the F grade on the transcript is removed for the Spring 2020 term.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank you once again for your valuable feedback. I would like to thank our faculty and deans for their careful consideration and thoughtful deliberations on this complex issue, and for supporting the rigors of a Georgetown education while addressing the needs of our most vulnerable students. We thank you for continuing to exemplify Georgetown’s spirit of cura personalis through this unprecedented time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Robert M.

Further complicating matters for so many of our students is that numerous restrictions began to be imposed after most of you had departed Spokane for Spring Break. We understand that this has been a frustrating time; our hearts and thoughts have been with you.</p>\n<p>Because I want everyone in our community to be aware of major decisions or actions we are taking, I am sending this letter to all students and families, even though it most directly impacts those students who have been living on campus this semester.</p>\n<p>Each day has brought new and more severe restrictions upon our ability as a university to provide the kind of experience that we seek for our students, and we anticipate these restrictions will increase and continue for some time to come. We had hoped to find a way to welcome students back to their on-campus housing; however, a succession of emergency declarations issued early this week have required all restaurants, entertainment facilities and recreational centers throughout Washington state to close, and reduced the number of attendees to no more than 50 (and preferably 0) at social events and gatherings. Even Bishop Daly has been compelled to suspend all public celebrations of the Mass until April. These latest orders, while appropriate from a public health standpoint, directly impact the way the University operates and provides housing and meals to our students.</p>\n<p>Because of these public health directives and our concern for the well-being of the Gonzaga community, we cannot re-open the residence halls and thus have determined that our on-campus residential facilities will formally “close” for the semester on Friday, March 27th. For a list of impacted on-campus residential facilities, please refer to the attached FAQ.</p>\n<p>At 5:00 p.m. on March 27th, ZagCard key access to all on-campus residential facilities will be “turned off.” However, so as to provide everyone with flexibility, we will provide all students the opportunity to make plans and arrangements to return and completely move out of their rooms no later than 5:00 p.m. on Monday, April 13th.</p>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<p>We are making your faculty aware of the fact that many students may not have immediate access to academic and instructional materials (e.g., textbooks, articles, etc.) due to having left them behind before Spring Break. We have asked faculty to be prepared to support students who find themselves in this situation.</p>\n<p>If circumstances make returning to move out of your room by April 13 th an impossibility, please contact the Housing Office at (509) 313-4103, between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and we will work with you on making special arrangements to secure your belongings and check out of your room.

International students, housing-insecure students, and those who due to extenuating circumstances cannot leave campus may apply to remain in on-campus residence halls, and these requests will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Students who are approved to remain must agree to abide by a more restrictive set of standards for personal conduct, including behaviors intended to reduce the risk of viral transmission, and in certain cases may be relocated to another room on campus. University policies, including the Student Code of Conduct, Housing and Residence Life policies, and the Harassment and Discrimination Policy remain in effect and apply at all times. Students who seek permission to remain on campus and who fall into one of the above categories must submit a Request to Stay form on ZagLiving as soon as possible, but no later than Monday, March 23 rd at 12:00 p.m. Noon (PDT).</p>\n<p>at 12:00 p.m. Noon (PDT).

Late yesterday, Governor Inslee announced that he was, under an emergency declaration, restricting activities at all public and private colleges and universities to prohibit them from conducting in-person classes – with the exception of labs and clinical courses (as long as “social distancing” is introduced and maintained). His declaration is effective as of Tuesday, March 17th and extends to Friday, April 24th (unless subsequently amended). The governor’s message parallels the timeline of today’s closure of all K-12 schools in the State of Washington.</p>\n<p>With this additional parameter imposed by the State, it is now clear that we have no option but to move to digital/distance delivery of our courses when we resume the semester on March 23rd, and we will plan to deliver courses in this manner throughout the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester. As the College and Schools continue their planning, we will address various practical issues related to course delivery (e.g., what meets the definition of “labs”). It is clear from discussions with the Governor that practicing “social distancing” – by avoiding large gatherings of people in close proximity – is the goal.</p>\n<p>The Governor’s emergency declaration did not direct universities to cease campus services and we understand the Governor was intentional about this. His declaration at this time only pertains to the teaching of academic courses. I want to assure you that we are currently actively working to develop our plan regarding all aspects of on-campus services including housing, food service, the Zag Shop and other University operations. We will communicate decisions regarding these services no later than Wednesday, March 18th, 2020.</p>\n<p>I know that this is a very challenging circumstance within which to plan and work, and I appreciate so much the patience and flexibility that people have demonstrated during this time. Many people have communicated with us over these past days with excellent questions, thoughtful concerns, and expressions of support. Thank you and please know that we will continue to monitor and communicate about this situation, which at this point is literally evolving on an hourly basis. Please know that we are regularly updating the University website as new information becomes available, at www.gonzaga.edu/coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Sincerely yours,</p>\n<p>Thayne M.

More recently, the news of infected persons in western Washington has demonstrated that the coronavirus is indeed being communicated between individuals in our part of the country. Although we have a Gonzaga community member who self-reported being tested, at present we know of no one at Gonzaga who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.</p>\n<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information</p>\n<p>Gonzaga leadership is working closely with public health officials to keep up to date on recent events regarding the virus and potential impacts to the University, and we are developing plans to mitigate those impacts. Further information about the virus and Gonzaga’s response is available at <a href=\"https://www.gonzaga.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.gonzaga.edu/coronavirus</a>.</p>\n<p>There is justified anxiety about the effects of COVID-19, particularly on the elderly and those who may have pre-existing conditions that weaken their immune systems. For the vast majority of individuals, COVID-19 will manifest with symptoms including fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. While there is no vaccine for COVID-19, the first line of defense is prevention. It is critical that we help our students to educate themselves about the virus and steps they can take to shield themselves from exposure. For this reason, I ask that you please review the information at <a href=\"https://www.gonzaga.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.gonzaga.edu/coronavirus</a> and point them to this resource as well. The information on this site is being updated daily.</p>\n<p>Anticipated Impacts to Instruction</p>\n<p>Faculty and students have asked about anticipated impacts to instruction and what steps they should take. At present, the number of people in Washington with confirmed infections is low. Correspondingly, impacts to the current instructional programs are modest, and faculty are encouraged to continue the normal course of instruction. This is an evolving situation, both in Washington and globally, so circumstances could change rapidly.</p>\n<p>Public health officials have recommended that people potentially exposed to the virus, or those demonstrating symptoms consistent with COVID-19, self-isolate and stay home from school and work. If a student in your class chooses to self-isolate, please accommodate them while they are away. Treat the student as if they were experiencing a health issue that keeps them from attending class. No doctor’s note is needed. Provide course materials and offer the opportunity for make-up work as you normally would. Making course materials and assignments available through Blackboard is strongly encouraged, as this approach also makes it easy to manage the distribution of materials and assignments to all students in your course.</p>\n<p>Once again, we strongly encourage frequent handwashing with soap and water, and using hand sanitizers. While our facilities are being cleaned daily, please be sure to clean your own keyboard(s), telephone(s), and personal work spaces.</p>\n<p>Current Planning for Potential Local Impact</p>\n<p>As we continue to monitor the events associated with COVID-19, we are developing a broader plan to account for a variety of scenarios, beginning with conversations and input from the Faculty Senate leadership. In the event of suspended campus operations, we are planning to support instructors in offering their courses online. This will include the use of existing teaching and learning technologies: Blackboard and Zoom. In the recent days, we have worked with the Gonzaga-in-Florence faculty to move their courses online for the remainder of the spring semester. In doing so, we have developed processes and compiled resources to facilitate this transition for the on-campus courses as well, should it become necessary to teach and learn via distance. Our colleagues in Instructional Design and Delivery (IDD) have prepared resources to support faculty in the technical aspects of moving content online. Training sessions on Blackboard and Zoom, both in-person and online, will be offered to anyone interested in learning how to use these technologies. The in-person training sessions are scheduled to be held in Hemmingson 004, still this week, as follows:</p>\n<p>Thursday, March 5 th , from 2 pm to 3 pm, and from 3 pm to 4 pm</p>\n<p>, from 2 pm to 3 pm, and from 3 pm to 4 pm Friday, March 6th, from 12 noon to 1 pm, and from 1 pm to 2 pm</p>\n<p>Additional Blackboard and Zoom training sessions will likely be offered in the future as well, depending on the circumstances. Additional training materials and resources for faculty are being created as you read this, and can be found at <a href=\"https://www.gonzaga.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.gonzaga.edu/coronavirus</a>. We encourage you to access this site for details on a newly created Blackboard course, which is being made available to all faculty who wish to learn more about posting course materials, building tests and quizzes, using the Blackboard Grade Center, building and managing discussions, creating course announcements and using other Blackboard tools and much more. As well, if you are unfamiliar with these technologies, now might be a very good time to ask your colleagues who do use online methods and learning management systems for their advice and wisdom.</p>\n<p>Gonzaga-in-Florence and Future Study Abroad Programs</p>\n<p>I want to express thanks to those colleagues from within the Gonzaga community who have been working so hard to develop plans to support our students from the Gonzaga-in-Florence program. As you may have heard today, Italy is taking new steps in an effort to contain the transmission of the virus by closing all schools (including universities). Shortly we will be announcing the academic continuation plan for our Florence students, most of whom have returned to their domestic homes.</p>\n<p>Our first priority has necessarily been to focus on current study abroad programs and students. Next week, a team of colleagues will be meeting to focus on Summer 2020 study abroad and to develop a protocol for evaluating the viability of programs offered in Summer. In large part we are following the advice and direction of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the State Department travel advisories in making our determinations; however, the dynamic nature of this situation and the need to monitor developments in real time makes longer-term planning difficult. We are committed to decision-making processes that are transparent and we will communicate regularly as decisions are made.</p>\n<p>Please Refer People to the Website</p>\n<p>I cannot stress enough how important providing factual information to students about the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the disease it causes (COVID-19), and ways of mitigating its impact is. It is critical that we help our students to educate themselves about the virus and steps they can take to shield themselves from exposure. For this reason, I again ask that you please review the information at <a href=\"https://www.gonzaga.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.gonzaga.edu/coronavirus</a> and point our students to this resource as well.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your support of our students and thier learning as we work through this time.</p>\n<p>Deena J.

It is an opportunity to celebrate the remarkable achievements of all those who have fulfilled the requirements for their degree and now can proudly claim the title, “alumnus.” I want to thank those of you who participated in our recent survey regarding Commencement and the many helpful comments that you offered. Having solicited input from students at the undergraduate, graduate and Law level, the strong preference – even if postponed – has been for an in-person celebration, which is our preference as well.</p>\n<p>In light of the current pandemic, we have decided to postpone the previously-scheduled May Commencement ceremonies for Undergraduates, Graduates and the Law School. Instead, we have decided to hold Commencement ceremonies honoring the Class of 2020, in Spokane, the weekend of September 4-7, 2020 (Labor Day Weekend). This date, of course, is contingent upon approval and acceptability of such events by the State and local health authorities.</p>\n<p>The Law and Graduate Commencement ceremonies, together with the Commencement Mass , would be held on Saturday, September 5, 2020 .</p>\n<p>and Commencement ceremonies, together with the , would be held on . The Undergraduate Commencement ceremony would be held at the Spokane Veterans’ Memorial Arena on Sunday, September 6, 2020.</p>\n<p>Our hope is that by setting a date for early Fall, we will give graduates and their families sufficient time to plan, the ability to gather and celebrate in person, and the capacity to support return travel on the Labor Day (Monday) holiday. We have consulted with the local hotels and they look forward to receiving our students and families that weekend.</p>\n<p>I do want to mention that, in conversation with GSBA President Michael Tanaka, we want to do everything possible to support a wonderful Commencement experience for each of our graduates. However, we have discussed the fact that for some people, the expense associated with returning to Spokane in September may be a challenge. Together, he and I will work to determine if we might find a way of helping to relieve the burden of this for at least some students. We will provide more information about this in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>I am very sorry that we must postpone Commencement this year; given circumstances, we believe moving the date to Labor Day Weekend is the best alternative. We will be providing additional information in the coming weeks. Thank you for your patience and understanding. We hope that you and your families will be able to make plans to return to Spokane for these celebrations.

Students have had their semester plans upended. Faculty members, in a short period of time, have been asked to determine how to offer the same consistently excellent education under sometimes very different circumstances. Staff members have worked tirelessly, both on-campus and off, to support these efforts. These transitions have allowed us to not only continue to operate, but to do so with the highest levels of care and service. We thank you for these efforts and the numerous ways that each of you have contributed to ensuring the safety of our GW community.</p>\n<p>As President LeBlanc said in his message yesterday, this pandemic and the subsequent interruptions it has caused have been unprecedented in their magnitude. Our university’s response to it must therefore consider the scope of the crisis when determining the safest way forward. With this in mind, we have implemented the following:</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, all employees who have been working remotely are required to continue teleworking until further notice.</p>\n<p>Units with designated on-site employees will continue to have free parking on campus available to help promote social distancing during your commute. Please speak to your supervisor about your responsibility.</p>\n<p>While your safety is critical, we must also approach this situation with care for your wellbeing. We have created a new paid time off option (PND) designed to support you as you care for yourself and your loved ones during this evolving situation. Further information on this enhanced leave option can be found on the GW Benefits website, along with the available FAQs, which will guide you through what you need to know.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, GW’s live-answer Information Line for COVID-19-related questions is available from Monday through Friday (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) and can be reached at 1-855-GWU-INFO (855-498-4636). This Information Line will assist faculty and staff with questions regarding university operations and will help connect community members with the appropriate offices and resources if they are unable to answer your specific questions.</p>\n<p>As this period of teleworking extends past the original timeline, collaboration remains critical to combat the isolation and anxiety that come with the distance and constant news. Tools and best practices for working remotely are available on the GW COVID-19 website. Because of this distance, a lot of work and action often remain behind-the-scenes and hidden while teams are remote. We encourage you to use our Positive Vibes to make these gestures (both big and small) visible.</p>\n<p>We wish you safety, health, and we continue to be grateful for your partnership moving forward.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Dana Bradley</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief People Officer</p>","id":"e0cc4c5f-5192-56d0-b14e-a99487ff98fb","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-gwu/2020-04-08-23_30_07/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Updates to Timeline for Working Remotely"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.gwu.edu/sites/www.gwu.edu/files/image/gw-primary_90x90.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Dear Resident Student,</p>\n<p>As a follow-up to our previous announcement about financial assistance, we are providing more details about how a credit will be applied to your student account for the nightly rate of your residence hall room starting March 20 through the end of the semester for the extended virtual learning period.

Some exceptions apply. For guidance on your school and how you will receive more information, please review the below carefully.</p>\n<p>The deans for ESIA, SEAS, GWSB, CCAS (including SMPA and the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design), Milken Institute SPH, and CPS have agreed on a common academic policy adjustment for undergraduate classes this semester. Students will have the option to take the undergraduate courses in these schools pass/no pass for this semester only. Students who still wish to complete these courses for a letter grade may continue to do so. Advising offices are aware of this change, and your school will follow up soon with more details on how this policy will be implemented. We encourage you to consult with academic, international, and military and veteran services advisors if you wish to use the pass/no pass option in any of your classes to ensure that you are still receiving letter grades in the courses that might affect your future plans, visa, or athletic status.</p>\n<p>Separately, because of professional expectations and/or licensure issues, all graduate schools and professional programs are creating tailored responses concerning any academic policy adjustments. We include in this category not only all of our graduate schools but also undergraduate programs in SON and SMHS. If you have not already, you will soon receive more information on any adjustments to academic policies for this semester.</p>\n<p>We understand that this is a particularly stressful time for you, and with these adjustments we want to give you flexibility while maintaining the academic rigor you expect and deserve from GW.

Curriculum and courses with clinical training are being shifted for the summer. Clinical programs will reach out to students about the ways in which the curriculum is being adjusted. Students should continue to check the summer schedule for upcoming changes.</p>\n<p>Housing, library and museum services. All residence halls will remain closed throughout the summer. In addition, the university will not provide intern or conference housing this summer.</p>\n<p>Gelman Library, Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library and the Jacob Burns Law Library buildings will remain closed until further notice. All libraries remain open virtually with online support. Remote library services and resources remain available, although all library buildings will remain closed until further notice. Sharing of print materials is suspended during this time, but digitization of print materials may be available with longer turn-around times. This is dependent on the safety for staff to work in the building.</p>\n<p>The George Washington University Museum and the Textile Museum will remain closed until further notice.</p>\n<p>Research.

Given the advice we are receiving from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other public health officials, and our own faculty, who are among the world’s leaders in infectious disease, epidemiology, and virology, it is difficult to imagine how we could safely hold such a large gathering this spring. We recognize that people need to start making plans soon, so we thought it best to provide guidance now.</p>\n<p>No virtual gathering can possibly match the splendor of our usual festivities, but we will come together online on Thursday, May 28, to award degrees so that everyone will graduate as expected. Each School at Harvard will also host its own special online event and afterwards deliver diplomas through the mail. We plan to host an in-person celebration sometime later, once we know it is safe to bring people together again. By then, we will be eager not just to celebrate our graduating students, but also to recognize and acknowledge the sacrifices that so many have made to ensure the well-being of our community. We intend for this ceremony to have all of the pomp, circumstance, and tradition that is typical of a Harvard commencement—with as many of the traditional campus festivities that typically precede commencement as possible.</p>\n<p>While commencement is a happy occasion for all of us, it has special meaning to the members of the Harvard College Class of 2020. We recognize that delaying the ceremony may impose new burdens on some of our undergraduates. We will endeavor in our planning to enable as many students as possible to return to campus to be awarded their first degrees in the company of their friends and classmates. We are also exploring opportunities to bring reunion classes together in the future. At this point, we don’t know when, but we will be in touch as soon as we have information to share.</p>\n<p>I wish we could give a firm date for this celebration now, but I ask for your patience. Everything about this year seems to be turning out unusual. When we do hold commencement for the Harvard Class of 2020, I sincerely hope it will also be unusual, but only because it will be among the most joyous commencements in the history of the University.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Larry</p>\n<p>Visit the Commencement FAQ page for additional information.</p>","id":"e4e99c42-4768-58ee-93e7-d78fb0ab865c","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-harvard/2020-04-08-23_38_08/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Harvard University"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/pages/social_imgs/080219_Features_KS_015.jpg\"></p>\n<p>March 10, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Harvard Community,</p>\n<p>Like all of you, I have been intently following reports of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and considering the many ways in which its future course might alter my life and the lives of those closest to me. These past few weeks have been a powerful reminder of just how connected we are to one another—and how our choices today determine our options tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, a group of extremely dedicated people has been working literally around the clock to respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19. Our teams are considering every contingency as they undertake their important work on your behalf, and I write today to update you on major near-term changes that will limit exposure to the disease among members of our community:</p>\n<p>We will begin transitioning to virtual instruction for graduate and undergraduate classes. Our goal is to have this transition complete by Monday, March 23, which is the first day of scheduled classes following Spring Recess.</p>\n<p>Students are asked not to return to campus after Spring Recess and to meet academic requirements remotely until further notice. Students who need to remain on campus will also receive instruction remotely and must prepare for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions. All graduate students will transition to remote work wherever possible. Schools will communicate more specific guidance and information, and we encourage everyone to review previous guidance about both international and domestic travel.</p>\n<p>We are transitioning over the course of the next few days to non-essential gatherings of no more than 25 people. Please note this is a change from prior guidance.</p>\n<p>The decision to move to virtual instruction was not made lightly. The goal of these changes is to minimize the need to gather in large groups and spend prolonged time in close proximity with each other in spaces such as classrooms, dining halls, and residential buildings. Our actions are consistent with the recommendations of leading health officials on how to limit the spread of COVID-19 and are also consistent with similar decisions made by a number of our peer institutions. The campus will remain open and operations will continue with appropriate measures to protect the health of the community.</p>\n<p>For regular updates and additional information, please visit this dedicated webpage. Provost Alan Garber, Executive Vice President Katie Lapp, and HUHS Executive Director Giang Nguyen will continue to send you updates by email as needed. You will also continue to receive School- or Unit-specific information from local leadership. If you are a student or faculty member and have specific questions or concerns, I encourage you to be in touch with the contacts identified by your dean. If you are an employee, I encourage you to be in touch with your manager.</p>\n<p>Despite our best efforts to bring the University's resources to bear on this virus, we are still faced with uncertainty - and the considerable unease brought on by uncertainty. It will take time for researchers, a good many of them who are our colleagues, to understand enough about this disease to mount a reliable defense against it. Now more than ever, we must do our utmost to protect those among us who are most vulnerable, whether physically or emotionally, and to treat one another with generosity and respect. Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services and the Harvard Employee Assistance Program are available to help you manage anxiety and stress. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.</p>\n<p>To our students, I know it will be difficult to leave your friends and your classrooms. We are doing this not just to protect you but also to protect other members of our community who may be more vulnerable to this disease than you are.</p>\n<p>To our faculty, I recognize that we are asking you midway through the semester to completely rethink how you teach. We do this because we know that you want to avoid putting your students at risk.</p>\n<p>To our staff, I understand that we are expecting you to go above and beyond in your efforts to support our important mission of teaching and scholarship. We do this because we know we can rely on your creativity, flexibility, and judgment through these challenging times.</p>\n<p>I am proud to be a member of a community where people put the greater good above their own self-interest. Thank you for your patience and your resilience as we all learn to temper increased distance with deeper care for one another.</p>\n<p>With appreciation,</p>\n<p>Larry</p>","id":"ca1c90d3-6cc2-5f04-808e-0c56535ec385","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-harvard/2020-04-08-23_38_11/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 – Moving Classes Online, Other Updates"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/pages/social_imgs/coronavirus_CDCx_27.jpg\"></p>\n<p>April 6, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Academic Deans, Administrative Deans, and Center Directors,</p>\n<p>As you know, Harvard-related international travel was prohibited as of March 6. This prohibition covers all members of the Harvard community (students, faculty, and staff) and currently extends through April 30. The Provost, HUHS Director, and Executive Vice President will announce tomorrow the extension of this prohibition through to the end of May.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, faced with imminent decisions on summer programming and research funding, many of you have asked for guidance on Harvard-related student travel for the summer. I write now with that guidance, which has been developed in conversation with colleagues across multiple Schools, medical and public health experts, and Global Support Services, and is approved by the Provost (who will announce this as well tomorrow):</p>\n<p>There should be no Harvard-organized or Harvard-funded international travel for students that is scheduled to start and end between now and August 31, 2020. This applies to undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students.</p>\n<p>There will be one standing exception to the policy above: Students already outside the U.S. at the time of this memo may be funded for research or other activities in their present location. Such activity must take into account local/domestic travel restrictions, self-isolation/quarantine requirements, and lockdown orders. Students may not travel across a national border as part of a Harvard program or with Harvard funds.</p>\n<p>Note that this guidance does not prohibit travel supported by grants and fellowships that ends after August 31, 2020. Although travel under such funds (such as year-long research fellowships abroad) currently remains prohibited, we recognize that recipients may be able to use these grants/fellowships in whole or in part once travel restrictions begin to be lifted (as we hope) in the coming months. Therefore, in award letters for grants supporting travel that ends after August 31, grantmakers should make clear that travel is prohibited at this time but may be permitted at some later date as circumstances evolve.</p>\n<p>Many of you have already decided to cancel or postpone summer programming, internships, and grants. These decisions are difficult and disappointing, especially as withholding support may create hardship for some students. Where gift or grant terms permit, I encourage everyone to think creatively (as some of you already are) about how students might redesign summer projects in ways that could allow them to still receive funding. I am glad to work with you in that effort, including seeking guidance from the Office of General Counsel as to the flexibility of gift terms. We have already learned, for example, that the David Rockefeller Fund for Undergraduate International Experience can be used to support undergraduates this summer, even if no international travel happens, so long as their planned activities include research on an international topic. Now would be a good time to explore similar possibilities with the funding your centers manage.</p>\n<p>The extraordinary events of the last few weeks have forced us all to make choices we would rather not make. As someone who cares deeply about international engagement and understanding, and who has advised scores of students who would have been or are currently affected by these policies, I deeply sympathize with the burdens that policies like these place on all of us. Thank you for your patience, wisdom, and resilience in responding to this unprecedented set of circumstances. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have questions.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Mark Elliott</p>\n<p>Vice Provost for International Affairs</p>\n<p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>\n<p>How does this guidance intersect with current guidance from the Provost on Harvard-related international travel?</p>\n<p>Following updated travel guidance from the Provost on April 6, all Harvard-related international travel is prohibited until at least May 31. We are issuing this additional and extended guidance for student summer travel that is organized or funded by Harvard because students, grantmakers, and program organizers need to make decisions now about their summer plans.</p>\n<p>What about domestic programs or funding for domestic experiences?</p>\n<p>At this time, the University is not prohibiting Harvard-organized or Harvard-funded summer experiences for students in the United States, although we strongly encourage students, grantmakers, and program organizers to consider summer activities that do not involve domestic travel. The University’s prohibition on non-essential Harvard-related domestic air travel is in effect until at least May 31. We recognize that the COVID-19 epidemic is having a substantial impact in the United States. However, international travel introduces a number of risks to travelers, above and beyond public health considerations, that do not exist for domestic travel: there is an increased risk of border closures and other travel restrictions, and an increased risk of cancelled flights and other transportation modes, and Harvard’s ability to assist international travelers in this environment is compromised. For these reasons, we have more time with domestic experiences to determine whether University-wide guidance is appropriate.</p>\n<p>Postponing my planned travel this summer may delay my time to degree. What should I do?</p>","id":"3bd50bc6-5d6a-5d49-821e-4f4c074c4439","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-harvard/2020-04-10-14_04_10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Summer International Travel Guidance for Students"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/pages/social_imgs/coronavirus_CDCx_28.jpg\"></p>\n<p>April 6, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Harvard Community,</p>\n<p>As together we rise to the challenges posed by these uncertain times, the health and safety of our community must guide every decision we make. Worldwide cases of COVID-19 continue to grow; governments continue to enact border, travel, and stay-at-home restrictions; and it is too soon to predict the trajectory of the virus at the local, national, and international levels over the next several months. Informed by the best available information, and with these circumstances in mind, we write to you with several updates on travel and summer programming.</p>\n<p>Current prohibitions on University-related international travel and non-essential domestic air travel are extended through at least May 31. Personal international travel remains strongly discouraged, and we still urge you to use extreme caution for personal domestic travel. This guidance pertains to all community members—students, faculty, staff, and postdocs/other academics. Because governments around the world, including the United States, may modify travel restrictions at any time, advance, nonrefundable travel purchases are inadvisable. We anticipate that all travel will continue to be disrupted for some time. We will continue to monitor the situation and will issue updated guidance when conditions change.</p>\n<p>Harvard-organized and Harvard-funded international travel for all students that is scheduled to start and end between now and August 31 is prohibited. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. State Department have issued global level 3 and level 4 advisories: “avoid nonessential travel” and “do not travel,” respectively. It is unclear when those restrictions will be lifted. We know that many of our students—undergraduates as well as graduate and professional school students—rely on summer travel to further their education, fulfill academic requirements, and explore new work environments. This decision is difficult and disappointing, but we urge students to contact their individual Schools, centers, and programs to explore creative options for alternative summer study, research, and work. For more information, see the memo from the Vice Provost for International Affairs.</p>\n<p>We are closely monitoring the worldwide suspension of routine visa processing at U.S. consular locations and advising international students and scholars accordingly. We anticipate that many newly admitted and returning international students and scholars will face delays in obtaining or renewing visas. The Harvard International Office (HIO) continues to issue the necessary University documentation for F-1, J-1, and other visa applications, so that when consular processing resumes, students and scholars will have the forms they need to schedule visa appointments. Visit the HIO COVID-19 webpage for the latest immigration updates and advice.</p>\n<p>As always, we continue to update the Harvard coronavirus website with the latest information, policies, and advice for teaching, learning, researching, and working remotely, as well as for maintaining your health and well-being and how you can support healthcare providers and first responders.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the frontline workers and our researchers, faculty, students, and staff for your tremendous efforts these past few weeks.

These policies are in effect for both undergraduate and graduate courses. These policies were developed in close consultation with faculty, students, staff and the Academic Senate.</p>\n<p>These academic policies will allow you some choices as you navigate this semester.

Graduate students participate in research, teaching, and scholarship. We are taking measures to support them in each of these areas.  Below we provide some guidance pertaining to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on graduate education, graduate employment, and the general health and wellbeing of graduate students.</p>\n<p>Graduate Education:</p>\n<p>Traditional classroom-based courses: Many graduate students are currently enrolled in traditional classroom-based courses. The campus will be suspending face-to-face course instruction after Spring Break. Face-to-face courses will be cancelled beginning March 23. Beginning as soon as possible after that date, most courses will be taught via alternative delivery approaches. Course instructors are responsible for contacting enrolled graduate students with instructions for how each course will be delivered. Information should be provided to students in need of special accommodations. Students who need accommodations or assistance with this transition should contact Disability Resources and Educational Services at +1-217-333-4603.</p>\n<p>Dissertation and thesis research and related independent study courses: Many graduate students work closely with faculty on a variety of research-based academic experiences such as Independent Study, Thesis, and Dissertation Research.  Campus is not closed. Faculty, graduate students and staff may still come to campus as usual.  It is our expectation that graduate students will continue to work with their advisor on these projects.  Graduate students should be encouraged to contact their advisor or their department for additional advice regarding how to best continue to make progress in these educational experiences. </p>\n<p>Internships and Clinical Rotations: Students who are in the process of completing assigned internships or clinical rotations should contact their advisor or supervisor to discuss how to best continue to make progress in these educational experiences. </p>\n<p>Administration of qualifying exams, thesis defenses, and doctoral preliminary and final examinations:  Many graduate students are currently preparing to take qualifying, preliminary or final dissertation or thesis examinations.  These examinations are an extremely important component of the student's academic program and should proceed as planned if at all possible.   In recognition of the fact that some committee members and graduate students may not be able to attend these examinations in person, the Graduate College is relaxing the regulations pertaining to the conduct of these examinations.  Specifically, effective immediately, the Graduate College will allow preliminary and final examinations to take place fully online by temporarily waiving current policy requirements that at least the chair and one additional member participate on campus. Students who are planning to take these examinations in the near future are encouraged to reach out to their advisor and department for additional information.</p>\n<p>Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Hourly Employees:</p>\n<p>Graduate students are extremely valued members of our community and our university would not be able to function without their hard work and contributions.  It is our intention to continue to rely on the services provided by graduate students during the current situation.  Graduate students with appointments will continue to be paid and will remain eligible for any tuition waiver associated with their appointment. Below we provide some additional information pertaining to teaching assistants, research assistants, other graduate assistants, fellows, and hourly employees.</p>\n<p>Teaching Assistants: The university is transitioning to online and alternative course delivery for traditional classroom-based courses. If a student is assigned to assist a faculty member as a TA or grader they will be expected to continue to assist with the course or courses to which they have been assigned.  TAs should contact the faculty member responsible for the course to which they have been assigned or their department for specific instructions for their assignment.  If a graduate student is assigned as the instructor of record for a course, the student should be contacted by the department or college with respect to providing advice about how best to ensure appropriate instructional continuity.</p>\n<p>Research Assistants: Graduate students who are employed as research assistants will continue to work on the projects to which they have been assigned.  We recognize that due to the fluid and changing nature of the current situation, specific duties and responsibilities may change.  Research assistants are encouraged to reach out to their supervisor for additional instructions pertaining to their assignment.</p>\n<p>Other Graduate Assistants: Many graduate students are assigned graduate assistantship responsibilities to support departmental, college, or central campus units in an administrative or service capacity. Graduate students will continue to work on the projects to which they have been assigned.  We recognize that due to the fluid and changing nature of the current situation, specific duties and responsibilities may change.  Graduate assistants are encouraged to reach out to their supervisor for additional instructions pertaining to their assignment.</p>\n<p>Fellows: Fellows will continue to receive monthly stipends in accordance with the terms of their fellowship.</p>\n<p>Hourly Employees: Hourly employees are encouraged to check with their employing unit about any new arrangements moving forward.</p>\n<p>Graduate Student Health and Wellbeing:</p>\n<p>We know the uncertainty of this situation is challenging for everyone in different ways. Our goal is that our graduate students will be able to focus on their studies, their work, their wellness and their lives. We will provide them with the support and resources they need to enable this to happen.</p>\n<p>Health and Wellness: The health and safety of our community is of paramount importance.  We recognize that in the coming weeks and months members of our community may become unwell and will not be able to come to the university.  The university has posted detailed guidance about how to respond to health challenges and how to seek assistance.  Graduate students are encouraged to reach out to their department or the Graduate College if they are in need of support or if they are unsure of what to do.  Additional information is available online at the Graduate College Need Help webpage and on the campus and Graduate College COVID-19 webpages.</p>\n<p>Coping with Anxiety and Stress: The Counseling Center provides services to help students address many academic, relational, social, and emotional concerns. Students in need of services should be encouraged to contact the Counseling Center to make an appointment. The Mental Health Clinic at McKinley Health Center offers a variety of services to students seeking assistance with stress, including educational resources for strategies and relaxation techniques.</p>\n<p>University-Sponsored Travel: The university is prohibiting all international travel on university-sponsored business including conferences for faculty, staff and students from March 16 until further notice. The university is limiting domestic travel for faculty, staff and students to pre-approved travel for essential university business including conferences. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Those who believe they have an essential business reason to travel can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare. </p>\n<p>Research or Study Abroad: The university has cancelled all international Study Abroad for all students from March 14 to at least August 15. Students are encouraged to return to the United States or to their home country. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Study abroad educational experiences are life-long and life-changing; however, our top priority at this time is to ensure our students’ personal health and safety while ensuring they can continue to make academic progress.</p>\n<p>Graduate students who are conducting research abroad are encouraged to return to the United States or to their home country. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Graduate students are encouraged to reach out to their faculty advisors.  Those who believe they have an essential reason to remain abroad can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare.</p>\n<p>Personal Travel: The university is strongly advising against all international and domestic air travel on personal business for faculty, staff and students, especially those with underlying health conditions. Anyone who travels to a CDC Level 2 or 3 region, whether for professional or personal reasons, will be required to self-quarantine off-campus for 14 days BEFORE returning to campus. More information about the Self-Quarantine Protocol can be found online.</p>\n<p>University Sponsored Events and Meetings: The university is suspending all university-sponsored, in-person events and meetings in campus facilities, effective March 13. More specifically, gatherings of 50 or more attendees should be postponed or cancelled. Instead, if possible and as appropriate, organizers should explore alternative ways of conducting the event, e.g., livestreaming and conference calling.  The university recommends that all in-person meetings be moved to an alternative solution unless meeting in-person is essential to do so. If so, please observe CDC guidelines on social distancing and other preventative measures.</p>\n<p>International Students: The university recognizes that this is a stressful time for our international students and that there is much uncertainty regarding travel at this point in time. The Office of International Student and Scholar Services is able to provide additional information and updates which are  posted on the International Student and Scholar Services website and the university’s COVID-19 webpage. </p>\n<p>Wojtek Chodzko-Zajko\nDean, Graduate College</p>\n<p>Susan Martinis\nVice Chancellor for Research and Innovation</p>","id":"036f7e73-5f9e-5771-85c4-cddde82ad2fb","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-illinois/2020-04-09-14_22_46/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Statement on Continuity of Graduate Research and Graduate Education"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Dear Members of the University Community,</p>\n<p>In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and continued guidance from both local and state health officials, we have made the decision that all Summer 2020 courses will be conducted remotely via alternative delivery mechanisms.</p>\n<p>We know that this decision about summer courses may generate additional questions about summer research, programs, travel, housing, events, remote work protocols, etc. We are not ready to make those decisions at this time, but as soon as we are ready, you will be notified.</p>\n<p>More details about Summer 2020 courses</p>\n<p>Registration for Summer session begins on April 20, 2020.

This is a rapidly changing public health situation, and it is now clear we need to go beyond the actions we have already taken. In less than one week since my first message to you on March 10, the World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and the U.S. government has declared a national state of emergency. Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb had earlier already declared a public health state of emergency. The number of confirmed cases across the U.S. and in Indiana is growing each day. As of my writing this, the total number in the U.S. is over 3,000 and rising rapidly.</p>\n<p>At this time, we continue to have no confirmed cases on Indiana University campuses. But with the anticipated greater availability of test kits in the near future, this could change very quickly.</p>\n<p>The health and safety of the IU community are our foremost concerns as we make vital decisions for the operations of the university. We continue to be advised by health experts, including those from county, state and federal agencies.</p>\n<p>We had hoped our intermediate steps would be sufficient, but it is now clear that IU must take the set of actions as outlined below to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. I know how deeply disappointing these changes will be for our entire community, and especially for our students. All of us regret deeply that we have to take these actions. Yet they are absolutely necessary, and we are asking all individuals to make deep sacrifices for the good of those in our community who are most vulnerable to the threat of infection.</p>\n<p>Classes to be virtual for the remainder of the spring semester</p>\n<p>IU is suspending face-to-face classes and transitioning to virtual learning for the remainder of the spring semester. Classes will not resume until March 30 (see extended spring break below).</p>\n<p>Students in courses with a clinical component or field work will receive further instruction from the academic leaders in their programs as to how these will be addressed. Faculty can continue to find resources on the Keep Teaching website. Students can find more information on online learning through the Keep Learning class on Expand as well as campus specific information on coronavirus.iu.edu.</p>\n<p>Residential housing to close</p>\n<p>To reduce large concentrations of students living in on-campus housing with many shared spaces and dining facilities, IU will close most of its residence halls and on-campus housing on March 20. Procedures for an orderly move-out and transition policies, including retrieving essential items, will be provided by each campus to housing residents via email by Tuesday and on campus housing websites. These will include procedures for students with highly exceptional situations who do not have a permanent residence or cannot return to their permanent residence, including some international students.</p>\n<p>Extending spring break one week</p>\n<p>As noted, spring break will be extended by one additional week. It will now be from March 14 to 29. This additional week will provide more travel flexibility for all students given the stress on domestic and international travel systems. It will additionally give faculty time to prepare for completing the semester via virtual teaching.</p>\n<p>Canceling and postponing events</p>\n<p>Upon the recommendation of the IU Foundation and in the continuing interest of safety, the Men's and Women's Little 500 bike races are canceled for this academic semester. This includes all associated events, including the qualifications events. The possibility of holding the events at some future date beyond this semester will be reassessed at a later date. I recognize that this necessary decision is especially heart-breaking for those students who have invested months of training in anticipation of this great contest on the Bloomington campus, but again it is necessary in the best public health interests of the IU community and the public.</p>\n<p>All other IU-affiliated events and gatherings should be postponed, canceled or conducted virtually for the rest of the academic semester.</p>\n<p>IU will assess in the coming weeks the future of its commencement ceremonies that are scheduled to be held on each campus in May.</p>\n<p>Working remotely</p>\n<p>IU campuses remain open with limited operations as I described in my Friday letter.</p>\n<p>Just as virtual instruction will continue for the remainder of the semester, staff and faculty who are able to meet their work obligations from home by telecommuting, and are in a position to do so, should continue to do this. Unit heads should continue to be as flexible as possible, considering the nature of the work and whether the necessary tools and technology are available to allow employees to fully perform their job duties away from campus.</p>\n<p>Staying informed</p>\n<p>As the worldwide situation with COVID-19 continues to change rapidly, it is vital that all students, faculty and staff check their IU email at least daily. Email from IU offices, along with the coronavirus.iu.edu website, will be the best way to stay informed as the circumstances concerning COVID-19 and the efforts to mitigate and control its spread continue to rapidly develop. This website includes campus-specific information, so please look for details pertaining to your campus on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>These are extraordinary times. I know how very difficult and deeply disappointing these steps will be for many students, staff and faculty. We profoundly regret having to arrive at this place, as I know that it means further disruption for all of you and your families. We do so now to enable everyone to better plan for the remainder of March and April. We are taking these necessary actions to support the health and safety of the IU community and the communities around our campuses. These steps will enable both our public health goals and continuity of our research and education mission in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>Even in trying times like these, IU continues to join with many other scientists at America’s leading research universities and those around the world to help find a cure and to refine effective practices of combating disease. I thank the researchers in our Schools of Medicine, Public Health and many others who are contributing to the analysis and public policy that help advance our well-being.</p>\n<p>I am deeply grateful to everyone in the IU community for your understanding and your willingness to navigate the disruptions caused by this virus. Personal responsibility and swift collective action are essential as we work together to protect the health and safety of our community.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Michael A.

As I stated on Tuesday, the health and safety of our IU community is our primary concern in this situation. Regular and timely updates are provided at the COVID-19 website whenever the situation changes or as soon as we have important information to share. I strongly recommend that you regularly check this website at least daily.</p>\n<p>To date, we have not identified any cases of COVID-19 on any IU campus.</p>\n<p>In consultation with health departments and medical professionals, IU will be closing additional facilities on our campuses effective Saturday, March 14, and canceling additional overseas programs. These decisions are being made to help mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19 and to help protect the IU community.</p>\n<p>Gyms, Child Care, Other Facilities</p>\n<p>All campus gyms, fitness centers, pools, and other similar venues, including those associated with athletics programs, will be closed through April 5. Local guidance will additionally be provided at each campus.</p>\n<p>All child care and day care centers will be closed through April 5.</p>\n<p>Bradford Woods will be closed through April 5.</p>\n<p>Athletics</p>\n<p>The Big Ten and the NCAA announced yesterday that they are canceling all competitions for the current season. The Big Ten further announced today that it has also suspended all organized team activities until April 6. This will be re-evaluated before that date.</p>\n<p>Study Abroad</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, all IU study abroad programs scheduled to begin on or before May 15 have been canceled. Programs scheduled to begin after May 15 are being evaluated for possible rescheduling or cancellation.</p>\n<p>International Travel</p>\n<p>A reminder that IU has amended its travel policy to require self-quarantine by only those travelers returning from countries under a CDC Level 3 warning. Any student, faculty member, or staff member returning from a country subject to a CDC Level 3 warning must self-quarantine off campus for 14 days before returning to any IU campus. This is a critically important public health measure. There will be no exceptions. This requirement currently applies to China, Iran, South Korea, and the 26 European countries in the Schengen Area; however, the CDC may add additional countries to the Level 3 list with little warning.</p>\n<p>Continuing Campus Services</p>\n<p>Individual research labs, academic buildings, studios, and clinical facilities will continue operations per the local decisions at each campus.</p>\n<p>Libraries, student technology centers, computer labs, and other academic spaces will remain open for the time being. Enhanced cleaning and mitigation efforts are being implemented as directed by IU Environmental Health and Safety. These spaces will be closed to non-IU visitors at this time.</p>\n<p>Campus buses will continue to run as normal, with the implementation of heightened cleaning protocols.</p>\n<p>Classes will resume via virtual instruction March 23.</p>\n<p>The reaction of the IU community to the unprecedented public health challenge of COVID-19 has been overwhelmingly positive and understanding of the decisions IU has had to make. The IU community’s response to these decisions has been swift and effective. I express my deepest appreciation and gratitude to everyone in the IU community and especially to our faculty and staff, who are working so vigilantly to mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19. These efforts are helping to keep our campuses and our surrounding communities healthy and safe. My sincerest thanks to faculty for their swift work in preparing and implementing virtual coursework for our students.</p>\n<p>As I previously mentioned, many of the measures we are taking will undoubtedly cause inconvenience and disruption, yet the risks of not acting now far outweigh the foreseeable inconvenience and challenges of these actions.

I am sincerely grateful to our entire university community for showing flexibility, humanity, and resolve over the past several weeks. With the significant disruption to our way of life and academic and societal norms, it is keenly important that we take a holistic view in determining how best to measure academic performance.</p>\n<p>We recognize that the difficult task of mastering the course material in your field of study is now complicated by the challenges of adapting to a remote learning environment, and that those challenges are not evenly felt by all students. Consequently, all of our divisions, in consultation with the Provost’s Office, have taken steps to expand the use of pass/fail grading this term. Schools are taking somewhat different approaches based on their individual circumstances and the concerns of their students.</p>\n<p>The Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and Whiting School of Engineering, with the input of the Homewood Academic Council, are adopting universal satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading this semester for their undergraduates. Some schools will begin offering forms of opt-in pass/fail, and others opt-out. Each of the Johns Hopkins school deans will be communicating to their students regarding adapted school grading policies, taking into consideration school-specific variables. All of the changes are based on the common recognition that we must provide greater accommodations to our students in this unusual and disrupted semester.</p>\n<p>We realize that no one grading option fits every individual student’s unique circumstances or desires. Each option has consequences for some that are less favorable than for others. And in an academic environment such as ours, simply passing or failing a class may seem antithetical to our nature as achievers. Both proponents and opponents of policies like universal pass/fail have raised thoughtful concerns and have principle on their side. We believe our divisions have adopted approaches that best maximize equitability and meet the needs of each student body in this unique time.</p>\n<p>I encourage all of you to continue to take advantage of the resources available to you, including your advisor, as well as health and well-being services. Johns Hopkins University is committed to ensuring that our community can successfully complete the current academic term with the least amount of disruption possible. We will continue to keep you informed of any critical changes and remind you to use the Hub COVID-19 information page for ongoing updates.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Sunil Kumar</p>\n<p>Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs</p>","id":"44234740-2347-59c7-8251-9e0fe25683d0","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-jhu/2020-04-08-23_40_27/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spring 2020 grading policies"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://api.hub.jhu.edu/factory/sites/default/files/styles/hub_xlarge/public/glass_seal_2019_0.jpg?itok=TVkbvXsO\"></p>\n<p>In response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, Johns Hopkins will finish the spring semester using remote instruction, university President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar announced today. The May 2020 universitywide Commencement ceremony will be held virtually.</p>\n<p>The full text of the message is below.</p>\n<p>Dear Johns Hopkins Students, Faculty, and Staff:</p>\n<p>The rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has called upon Johns Hopkins—and each of you—to take a series of unprecedented steps to safeguard our community and ensure that we can accomplish our mission to care for those we serve, including the most vulnerable among us. Today, we have arrived at another critical juncture in our response, and we have made the difficult but necessary decision to suspend all in-person classes through the end of the spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>Community transmission of the virus is accelerating nationally and within our region, and we continue to be guided by public health authorities and infectious disease and epidemiological experts at Johns Hopkins who are now urging all of us to observe stricter social distancing protocols for a longer period of time. We make this decision mindful of the toll caused by the uncertainty around this pandemic, including the uncertainty that comes with not knowing whether or when we might reconvene in person as a university community this semester.</p>\n<p>With the safety of our community foremost in mind, we are taking the following steps:</p>\n<p>All in-person classes will continue as remote/virtual instruction for the rest of the semester, with remote/virtual instruction beginning in full no later than March 23 (for undergraduates, following spring break).</p>\n<p>All in-person, university events are suspended pending further notice, including tours, admissions events, and alumni events.</p>\n<p>The Provost's Office and deans will convene remotely divisional academic bodies to consider and make necessary adjustments to exams, grading, course credit, and degree requirements, among other academic impacts.</p>\n<p>Online and virtual teaching support is being made available for all faculty, lecturers, and TAs.</p>\n<p>The May 2020 universitywide Commencement exercises will be held virtually (all in-person Commencement ceremonies are cancelled). We will work with our divisions and students on plans to gather our graduates together for virtual ceremonies this May and in-person celebrations at a later date. More information regarding virtual universitywide Commencement activities will be made available to students and families later this week.</p>\n<p>University meetings and work activities, even those deemed essential, must be conducted remotely whenever possible and no in-person meetings or activities may be held with greater than 10 people (with limited exceptions, such as select types of clinical care).</p>\n<p>Nonessential university-sponsored international and domestic travel is suspended.</p>\n<p>We are winding down all but critical research, transitioning to telework for as much of our work force as possible, and providing emergency COVID-19 leave for our employees, as set forth in the email messages over the last several days.</p>\n<p>Outlined below, please find details about these actions. Please also check the Hub's COVID-19 information page for further updates.</p>\n<p>We recognize the very real challenges these steps pose for members of our community. In particular, we know that the decision to end in-person activities for the full semester comes as a great disappointment to many, as it does to us. We deeply regret that we will not be able to celebrate in person with our graduating students, their families, and friends at Commencement. Gathering as a community to honor our graduates is a cherished tradition, but in true Hopkins fashion, we will summon our optimism and creativity to mark that important milestone in a way that expresses the great joy and pride we take in the accomplishments of our extraordinary students.</p>\n<p>As we face this profound challenge together, we are so proud of our students, faculty, and staff—among them our indefatigable frontline caregivers and researchers—who have demonstrated unflagging devotion to furthering our mission to educate, discover, and serve. You exemplify the best of this institution, and in these most trying times, we are truly grateful for all you have done to help us forge a path forward as a community. Though we will not be together in person for the immediate future, we continue to draw inspiration and strength from this remarkable community no matter where we may find ourselves in the world.</p>\n<p>You will continue to hear from us and university leadership over the course of this unfolding situation. Please take care and treat yourselves and one another with compassion and thoughtfulness.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Ronald J. Daniels</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Sunil Kumar</p>\n<p>Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs</p>\n<p>For undergraduates:</p>\n<p>The suspension of in-person academic work includes labs, research for credit, practicums, and similar experiences.</p>\n<p>Residential undergraduate students have been required to leave campus and provided support to do so. Only those who have been granted specific exceptions have been allowed to stay. Any student who was granted an exception but is now able to leave campus should contact Student Affairs for support in arranging departure from campus.</p>\n<p>Student Affairs will establish a procedure for residential students to return to campus to collect their belongings or move them into storage. Please look for an email detailing the collection procedure before coming on campus.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage our undergraduates who live off campus to seriously consider returning to their permanent residence, in consultation with their families, given the limited on-campus support capacity at JHU.

Our Life Design Lab stands ready to provide career services remotely, as well as assistance to those applying to graduate school or planning to work at Hopkins after graduation. We will hold a virtual Commencement this spring and offer opportunities to walk at future graduation ceremonies, and we are already in discussion with student leaders about gathering the class together this fall as a part of our traditional Young Alumni Weekend.</p>\n<p>More information about Life Design Lab services and plans for Commencement will be communicated later this week.</p>\n<p>For graduate students:</p>\n<p>Plans for clinical and lab-based programs, practicums, or the equivalent will be determined by the divisions, but all in-person courses will be delivered virtually/remotely through the end of the spring semester.</p>\n<p>Graduate students with teaching responsibilities are expected to continue their duties via remote instruction for the remainder of the semester.</p>\n<p>The salary or stipend support and benefits currently offered to PhD students and postdoctoral fellows will not be interrupted as they work remotely.

Like you, we are incredibly disappointed that we will not be able to hold this traditional celebration in May, but we remain committed to marking this momentous occasion in your lives – and hope this will ultimately be a moment to rally around each other in the face of adversity. You have worked far too hard, and your families have dreamed far too long of the moment when you walk across the stage to receive your degree, to let this moment pass without taking our best shot at honoring you with as much pomp and circumstance as we can muster.</p>\n<p>This week, your Senior Class leaders joined the first of many conversations with university leadership to help bring this virtual Commencement to life. We appreciate their strong support and understanding, and we look forward to working with them to do everything we can to keep alive our treasured academic traditions and create an event that is meaningful and festive for all of you.</p>\n<p>We also are planning other opportunities for in-person celebrations in the future, including hosting the Class of 2020 for a Senior Week(end) when you are on campus next fall during Young Alumni Weekend and having a Spring 2021 Commencement “re-do” for the Class of 2020 when we hope to return to Royal Farms Arena.</p>\n<p>We recognize that you and your families will have many additional questions about planning. More details about the virtual ceremony, including travel planning and regalia, will be shared with you and your families in the coming days on the Commencement website. You will also hear more from us in the coming weeks about plans for future in-person events for the Class of 2020.</p>\n<p>In the course of these past few weeks, you have collectively responded to the significant disruption that the pandemic has wrought to your senior spring with reserves of maturity, intelligence and grace. We know that you will continue to draw on these reserves as we navigate the next two months together and adapt to a world that calls upon each and all of us to play our role in safeguarding and sustaining our families, friends, and the communities of which we are part.</p>\n<p>We ask that you and your families and friends continue to hold May 21st for our virtual celebrations and stay tuned for future plans. We cannot wait to celebrate with you – albeit in a new way – and we know we will find a path forward together.</p>\n<p>Stay safe. Stay heathy.</p>\n<p>Yours,</p>\n<p>Ron</p>\n<p>Ronald J.

Every one of you is contributing to our collective efforts to help “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 in order to facilitate our eventual return to normalcy and ease the burden on our community and health system. We salute all of our essential team members doing important work to take care of people and places at the heart of the institution.</p>\n<p>We are continually evaluating our mitigation efforts and operations in light of public health guidance and government orders. Below please find newly updated information and reminders regarding the university’s plans and status, the resources that are available to you, and the numbers to call if you feel ill or are concerned about exposure to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>We also remind you that as an inclusive university community, we must take care not to make assumptions about others based on perceived symptoms or identities (for example, ethnicity or national origin) and to differentiate between myth and fact. You may visit the Office of Institutional Equity website to learn more about the university’s discrimination and harassment policies and procedures or to make a report.</p>\n<p>New Information</p>\n<p>Remote/online programs extended through June 30 .

JHU Adopts CDC guidelines for use of face coverings. Per the new CDC guidelines, we encourage all JHU affiliates to wear non-medical, cloth face coverings in public and at work as a way to slow the spread of the virus and help diminish the risk that asymptomatic people who may be carrying the virus transmit it to others. Note that this guidance is in addition to the recommended six feet of social distancing. Due to limited supply at this time, medical masks will be prioritized for the health care setting.</p>\n<p>Employee/Workforce Information</p>\n<p>We will maintain our current operational posture for telework, on-site essential personnel, facility management, custodial support, and staffing levels to meet essential functions until further notice. Essential personnel should have received personalized letters from Human Resources as documentation of your essential status. If you did not receive such documentation but believe you should have, please email HRCovid19@jhu.edu</p>\n<p>For the protection of our essential staff, we will continue to evaluate and adjust on-site staffing levels to maximize social distancing and have the least number of people on our campuses at any given time.</p>\n<p>We do not yet know a potential return date for all on-site personnel. We will continue to monitor and adjust all calendars and timelines according to public health guidance and government directives.</p>\n<p>We are working to maintain pay and benefit continuity for our employees to the greatest extent possible and have been in communication with our vendors to help mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on their employees. We were pleased to see that the federal CARES legislation significantly increased the level of unemployment insurance through July 30 for laid off vendor workers, and we continue to explore other ways to support them during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Health and Well-being</p>\n<p>We recognize that the continued disruption and stress of this unusual time may take a toll on your personal health and well-being. We encourage you to utilize the mental health support resources available and remind you of the steps you should take if you are concerned about potential exposure or symptoms of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>For Employees:</p>\n<p>Employees, post docs, and house staff who are concerned about COVID-19 symptoms should call the Employee COVID-19 Call Center (ECCC) at 443-287-8500, seven days a week, between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. If you need clearance to return to work after being tested or recovering from COVID-19, please contact the call center for that as well. The Employee COVID-19 Call Center is staffed by Johns Hopkins nurses and physicians and specially trained nursing and medical students. When you call, a representative will instruct you about next steps depending on your circumstances. They will arrange for testing if needed and assist in transmitting information to Occupational Health.</p>\n<p>You are always free to call your personal primary care provider, and should continue to do so for family members who have symptoms; JHU employees should call the ECCC so that we can give you the best direction for your circumstances and arrange for testing if needed.</p>\n<p>Emotional support resources are available through MySupport.</p>\n<p>For Students:</p>\n<p>Students (full- or part-time) affiliated with Carey Business School, Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (including Advanced Academic Programs), Peabody Institute, School of Advanced International Studies, School of Education or Whiting School of Engineering (including Engineering for Professionals) should contact the Homewood Student Health and Wellness Center at 410-516-8270. Online scheduling has been temporarily disabled.</p>\n<p>Students (full- or part-time) affiliated with the schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health should contact University Health Services (UHS) at 410-955-3250. For urgent concerns after hours, please call the Johns Hopkins Hospital’s page operator at 410-955-4331 and request the on-call physician for UHS primary care.</p>\n<p>A full list of health support resources, including mental health, for students is available on the student wellness website.</p>\n<p>Notice of COVID-19 Cases at JHU</p>\n<p>In carefully balancing personal privacy and public health interests, we are not communicating broadly about each positive case at JHU. Rather, we are following established protocols for managing cases involving JHU-affiliates through Occupational Health, Student Health, and other resources. Anyone at the university who has come into close contact with individuals who test positive will be contacted directly and made aware of precautions or steps they should take.</p>\n<p>Operational Reminders</p>\n<p>Access to all campus buildings is restricted. All buildings are locked and require key card swipes for entry or will have a staffed on-site security station. Any faculty member, staff member, trainee, graduate student, or postdoc who believes they need building access must be essential and must have documentation from the university regarding their status.</p>\n<p>Any undergraduates who have been granted a rare exception to remain on campus will be able to access only their assigned residence hall, dining facility, and Wolman (to retrieve mail). These students must adhere to the requirements of the current stay-at-home order issued by the state of Maryland.</p>\n<p>Facility maintenance and custodial services have been realigned to operate with the minimum number of staff at any given time to perform necessary duties. Facility managers are scheduling and rotating staff at minimal levels to maximize adherence to public health guidelines and will continue to evaluate and adjust staffing levels.</p>\n<p>We will maintain an active security posture at all campuses during this period of restricted access and limited campus activity. Campus Safety and Security remains in operation 24 hours a day. In an emergency, contact 410-516-7777 or dial 911. For non-emergencies, call 410-516-4600.</p>\n<p>Transportation services, including Lyft and the Blue Jay Shuttle, continue but with adjusted schedules to meet current needs and reduced demand. We continue to tailor occupancy restrictions on our vans and buses to ensure appropriate social distancing.</p>\n<p>We are proceeding with construction activity that is currently in progress, in conformance with state guidance. This work will be performed with close attention to the health and safety of contractors and crews, who have developed specific plans to follow CDC, state, and local guidelines for social distancing and health protection. Projects in progress will be reevaluated on a regular basis for health and safety assurance and financial viability. At this time we are deferring the start of all but specifically approved new projects.</p>\n<p>During this period of restricted access and reduced campus operations, essential supply chain services will continue, including mail and package delivery and critical supplies. In light of recent guidance, mail and package delivery schedules will be reviewed and in some cases reduced. Specific changes will be coordinated at the campus level.</p>\n<p>We will continue to monitor the situation and communicate with you regarding any significant updates. Information on university operations is updated regularly on the Hub COVID-19 information page.</p>\n<p>Please continue to prioritize health and safety for yourself and those around you.</p>","id":"a3023a8f-1848-5ce7-b8e8-9acc5ca54857","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-jhu/2020-04-10-14_05_12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 update on university operations and resources"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.lehigh.edu/~inis/images/social-logo.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Dear Faculty and Instructional Staff,</p>\n<p>I write this note encouraged by all you have been able to do in such a short period of time to adjust to our role in slowing the spread of COVID-19—and as uncertain as you about how this plays out, for how long, and with what lasting consequences. It is both a sprint and a marathon.</p>\n<p>Now, with a full week of remote teaching and learning complete, you might have a better sense of where you’re headed with your courses. Even though right now social distancing and online-only contact might make things feel quite the opposite, we’re all in this together.</p>\n<p>The interpersonal connection so central to the Lehigh academic experience is certainly more challenging to achieve in a remote learning environment. I suspect our students are feeling this lack of connection to other students and their faculty, just as you might be. The exchanges that occur so naturally in a physical classroom, studio or lab might not feel as natural via webcam or online discussion board. Conversations might seem a bit more stilted, or perhaps even interrupted by slow internet speed or a workspace distraction. It’s easy to feel disconnected.</p>\n<p>One thing we all have in common during this time—faculty, students, staff—is that we’re all human, and we’re all dealing with the challenges of this pandemic. I suggest we hold on to that commonality—our shared humanity and the realities that come with it.</p>\n<p>I was on a Zoom meeting last week, each of us working at home, and one such reality came into play: a background of dogs at each participant’s home, trying to get into the picture. Pretty quickly almost everyone (dogs, I mean) did. This was an accidental moment of connection that may seem a little unprofessional, but we all found ourselves sharing our relationships with our animals with each other, an interaction that probably would not have happened if we were meeting on campus.</p>\n<p>I’m thinking that replicating live conversations through Zoom won’t completely replace the serendipity of face-to-face conversations, but maybe deliberate efforts to personalize those online connections might. I’m trying that myself by making for my class very short, very amateurish five-minute videos from my house. I’m fortunate there are relevant topics I can cover from my messy garage. Normally, I wouldn’t make a video of my home workspace because it’s not really relevant; I’m thinking maybe now it might be. Glimpses of your reality—your home workspace, messy or not; a meaningful piece of art on the wall behind you; or perhaps even the noise of children in the background—might help foster interpersonal connection.</p>\n<p>We can help our students in other simple ways as well. Students are dealing with the distance from their friends and familiar Lehigh places, as well as the occasionally awkward experience of being ‘back home’ while continuing their studies. Those of you with college students are experiencing this yourselves. Many students are now fully ensconced with the sometimes supportive, sometimes entirely too much ‘in your business’ (as my daughter would say) family that used to be many miles away, but now is not. These students’ eager parents might be asking many questions about coursework. It’s probably a really good time to help with that by clarifying learning objectives for our students in language they can share with their now very close fa mily members.</p>\n<p>We also have students struggling with just the opposite: a far more challenging home situation that might involve familial conflict or financial struggles or health concerns. Some might not have the support they need and were able to rely upon while on campus. Let’s pay particular attention to these needs as well, and offer students our understanding and support.</p>\n<p>Aside from the practical elements of finishing the semester, earning credits, and, for some of our students, graduating, I imagine we also provide our students a little bit of ‘normal’ in a sea of uncertainty. I know that happens as a result of huge effort on your part. Thank you for that.</p>\n<p>This week Greg Reihman and LTS are planning additional workshops, which I encourage you to attend. I also encourage faculty and instructional staff to find opportunities (e.g., working groups) to share challenges, solutions and opportunities. In particular, I invite you to create one of your own and, if you are willing, open it to others. If it is helpful, you can contact Greg to see how LTS might support such a group.</p>\n<p>Please take care of yourselves and your families, and stay as healthy as you can. If you have suggestions for me, you know how to find me.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Pat Farrell</p>","id":"e764ea1b-9b9d-5f2b-af72-c6f090350640","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-lehigh/2020-04-08-23_27_53/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"3.24.20: Week 2--Remote Teaching and Learning"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"http://www2.lehigh.edu/sites/www2/files/2020-03/COVID-rectangle-updates_3.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Dear Students,</p>\n<p>During this difficult time, it is only natural for individuals in our community to feel anxiety, worry or even fear. The spread of COVID-19 around the world is an unprecedented event, and we know that for some of you, it may feel especially overwhelming.</p>\n<p>For those of you who have received permission from the university to remain on campus as the university has shifted to a remote learning environment, this time can pose some unique challenges. As public health officials ask all Americans to practice social distancing, we understand that students may begin to experience feelings of loneliness. These feelings may only be exacerbated by the fact that some of you are far away from family and friends back home.</p>\n<p>Though we have scaled back some of our on-campus services, we want all of our students to know that we continue to offer an array of health and wellness resources that can provide medical advice, emotional support and more.</p>\n<p>If you are feeling ill, please contact our Health &#x26; Wellness Center at 610-758-3870. Our staff can assist you in determining a plan of care and ensure that you are taking every precaution necessary to keep yourself and your fellow students safe.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself feeling frightened, sad, or frustrated, we encourage you to reach out to those most familiar and close to you as well as offer to be there for others. In addition, if you think it might be helpful to talk things through with a counselor, we welcome you to contact our Office of Counseling and Psychological Services at 610-758-3880 or 610-758-5183. The center is open and counselors are available 24/7 to talk and provide support and assistance.</p>\n<p>We are appreciative and proud of the way our students have responded during a time of immense challenge, especially through your cooperation in terms of social distancing.

Given the current conditions with the COVID -19 pandemic, we have made the following decisions:</p>\n<p>Lehigh is suspending all Lehigh-led summer abroad programs that are scheduled to begin prior to August 1. We will be communicating this to students later this afternoon. Programs that begin after August 1 are not suspended, but will be reviewed again before May 13. If the US State Department has not lowered the worldwide global health travel advisory from a level 4 (Do not travel),ITAC will suspend the program. If the travel advisory has been lowered, program directors may continue to make plans; however, the worldwide global health advisory must be at a level 2 by the time of travel in order for the program to continue. Program directors will be required to submit amended ITAC documents indicating planning with regard to the continued COVID-19 risks, including financial.

Please continue to check the COVID-19 Graduate Studies page for updated informati on. On the FAQ page, there is a link to submit questions that you would like us to answer.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this email is to offer guidance on graduate course grading, virtual dissertation defenses, on-line submission of theses and dissertations, and an extension of graduation deadlines for graduate students.</p>\n<p>Grading System for Graduate Students</p>\n<p>As you know, undergraduates will have the option to choose the CR system for their final course grades this semester. After consulting with the Graduate Associate Deans of the colleges, the GSS President, the Associate Dean for Graduate Life, the Registrar, and other senior leaders, we have decided that the current grading system for graduate students has enough flexibility built in and therefore will not change.</p>\n<p>We recognize that graduate students are facing additional stress, as those in coursework adjust to taking courses remotely, TAs transition the courses they are teaching to remote instruction, RAs continue research while observing social distancing in the lab and prepare for a potential shut down, and GAs work with their supervisors to shift to projects that can be accomplished remotely. In addition, about a third of our graduate students are international; either unable to return home or facing difficult journeys if they do. Finally, many graduate students are responsible for caring for children who are now home from schoo l, or for elderly parents whose health risk is high if they contract the virus.</p>\n<p>With all this in mind, we encourage faculty to adjust the content and assignments in their graduate courses to reduce stress for everyone, even as students work to achieve learning objectives crucial for their careers.</p>\n<p>In addition to its inherent flexibility, there are three additional reasons for retaining the current grading system for graduate education as the default. First, it is important for graduate students to receive grades in order to prevent ambiguity about the competencies achieved when applying for licensure, certification, or continued graduate education. Second, R&#x26;P does not allow the Pass/Fail option for graduate courses. And third, the CR option offered to Lehigh undergraduates does not map onto the R&#x26;P rule that graduate students lose their good standing after receiving 4 grades lower than B- because it is not clear what the grade threshold would be for Credit.</p>\n<p>Alongside reasonable adjustments to individual course content, two key elements in the current grading system for graduate education offer room for accommodation. First, R&#x26;P provides for the liberal use of Incomplete for graduate courses, an appropriate option for graduate students who are experiencing difficulty due to the current challenging circumstances. Students can request an Incomplete in a course at any time in the semester. Second, a grade of SP, or Satisfactory Progress, already used to indicate that a multi-semester research project such as a thesis or dissertation is underway, is also available to graduate students undertaking fieldwork that they are not able to complete due to the current crisis. Unlike an Incomplete, SP will not automatically convert to an F after a period of time. Instead, it can serve as a placeholder as long as needed. When the graduate student completes the fieldwork, research, thesis, or dissertation, the faculty member can convert the SP into a standard grade.</p>\n<p>To summarize, while the current grading system for graduate education with the options of Incomplete and SP offers flexibility, faculty should adjust course requirements where possible to respond to the complex stressors graduate students are experiencing during this time. The assignment of an Incomplete or an SP this semester should not be regarded negatively.</p>\n<p>Theses and Dissertations</p>\n<p>Many graduate students are in the thick of preparing to submit their Masters Theses, or preparing to defend and submit their Dissertations. We recognize how stressful it is to reach these major milestones during a pandemic. We hope graduate students and advisors will find a way to reflect with pride on all that graduate students have had to accomplish in order to reach this point in their education, and to celebrate in whatever way is possible. We offer guidance on virtual dissertation defenses, the on-line submission of paperwork, and graduation deadlines below.</p>\n<p>Dissertation Defenses</p>\n<p>As of 3/18/2020, the university has limited gatherings to 10 people or fewer. Although a doctoral defense can include as few as 5 people (1 doctoral student and 4 committee members), we still urge you to make plans now to conduct defenses remotely. LTS recommends using Zoom for remote defenses. Faculty, doctoral students, or staff should contact LTS Help for assistance in preparing to set up the Zoom session for the defense or for support during the defense itself. The LTS Help Desk is aware that these are especially high-stakes moments and will be prepared to offer extra support. If the presentation is followed by a confidential committee discussion, you will need to set up two different Zoom conferences. It is up to individual programs and advisors to decide whether to include audience members—such as other students, other faculty, and family members—in the Zoom defense.</p>\n<p>On-line Submission of Paperwork for Dissertations and Theses</p>\n<p>We are working with Registration and Academic Services (RAS) and the Graduate Managers (or designees) in each college to develop mechanisms for the electronic submission of required paperwork for those finishing theses and dissertations. More information about the process will be available next week.</p>\n<p>Deadlines</p>\n<p>Masters and Doctoral students who plan to graduate in May are likely experiencing unexpected challenges and may need more time to complete the requirements. Although we do not yet know what will happen with the May Commencement, degrees will be conferred as planned on May 18. RAS is able to extend the deadlines for May degree conferral by two weeks. Thus, the April 10th delivery of theses and dissertations will be extended to April 24th, and the May 1st deadline for all paperwork and uploading the dissertation will be extended to May 15th. If you find that you are not in a position to meet the new deadlines for the May deg ree conferral, please consider aiming instead for the dates associated with the August 25th degree conferral. Consult your individual college websites for specific due dates for August.</p>\n<p>Finishing a dissertation or thesis is difficult enough, and in these anxious times it is so much more challenging. If you need more time, there is absolutely no shame in shifting to the August dates. International students can request an extension with OISS; program extensions happen all the time. If you move to the August 25th degree conferral, you will still be eligible to walk in the May Commencement ceremony when and if this ceremony is held. We are working on a university-wide policy on eligibility for the Hooding Ceremony for August graduates; it currently varies by college. We will update you when that is finalized.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Pat Farrell and Beth Dolan</p>","id":"e2509782-876a-587b-8ead-79e40183ff32","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-lehigh/2020-04-08-23_28_07/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"3.19.20: Graduate Education--Grades, Virtual Defenses, Paperwork Submission, Graduation Deadlines, etc."}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.lehigh.edu/~inis/images/social-logo.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>\n<p>As the COVID-19 health crisis unfolds, it has become clear that the disruption to the Lehigh Valley will continue into the summer months. Lehigh’s first day of summer courses—Summer Session I courses and Summer Session full-term courses—is Tuesday, May 19.</p>\n<p>As you are already aware, we have postponed Commencement, originally scheduled for this similar timeframe, and Reunion, which was scheduled for June. In the same vein, following the advice of our health professionals and CDC guidance, we can reasonably expect that social distancing will continue to be recommended for at least a good part of the summer session.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we have decided that all Lehigh courses offered during the summer of 2020 will be delivered via remote instruction. Making this decision now will allow for more certainty and planning as we all prepare for the summer. We encourage faculty and instructional staff to seek assistance as needed when planning summer courses. The Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning has helped many instructors transition to remote teaching this semester and has been helping faculty develop online summer courses for many years. Look for upcoming communications from the CITL with information, resources, and support plans for instructors moving forward.</p>\n<p>We know this semester has been challenging for students, faculty and staff, and that the summer session might present similar challenges. We appreciate your continued enthusiasm and effort, which serve as a constant reminder of what makes Lehigh great.

Undergraduate and graduate student employees are not to report to their on-campus employer for the remainder of the spring semester. Student Employment Services (SES) shares the following important updates below. To read the full update, visit the SES website. For specific questions and consultation, contact SES at ses@lmu.edu.</p>\n<p>March 27, 2020 Payment – All undergraduate and graduate student employees will be paid on March 27, 2020. Student employees must have an active Student Employment Authorization (SEA) to receive this paycheck and will be paid regardless of their SEA award balance. This paycheck will be a duplicate of the March 13, 2020, paycheck, which reflects hours worked February 23 – March 7, 2020.</p>\n<p>Additional Payment - After the March 27, 2020, paycheck, student employees with SEA balances will receive a lump sum payment on April 8, 2020 to absolve their remaining earnings. The lump sum payment will be calculated using the March 13 paycheck hours, multiplied by four (the number of pay periods remaining in the semester). However, the lump sum payment will not exceed the SEA award amount.</p>\n<p>Paycheck Distribution for Student Employees – Checks will be deposited for those authorized with direct deposit service. Paper checks can be picked up between 8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. in the Payroll Office, University Hall 1880. The last physical distribution of paychecks will be March 27, 2020.</p>\n<p>If you believe there are major discrepancies in your hours worked February 23 – March 7, or if your SEA balance is negative or low, consult with your supervisor immediately.</p>\n<p>Distribution Center Update</p>\n<p>The Campus Business Center will close beginning Monday, March 23. Campus residents who need to pick up mail after this date should contact the Distribution Center directly at dchd@lmu.edu to schedule mail retrieval or arrange for mail forwarding.</p>\n<p>The Distribution Center is currently looking into options for re-shipping FedEx and UPS packages to alternate addresses. If a solution is identified, instructions will be posted on the Distribution Center's website.</p>\n<p>Distribution Center Special Weekend Operating Hours - The Distribution Center will be open this weekend with limited staffing to facilitate student package pick-up.

I am grateful to the entire LMU community for your flexibility and willingness to work together and care for one another, as Lions do, to transform what feels like an insurmountable challenge into a time of growth and resilience. We stand in solidarity with one another, and I have faith that we will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.</p>\n<p>Please note the following signature updates:</p>\n<p>At this time, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on our campuses.</p>\n<p>Our campuses will remain open, but with limited operations and services.</p>\n<p>We are asking students to remain at home or to return home or to their off-campus residences, and we are closing on-campus housing on March 22.

Further details are forthcoming. Please contact Student Employment Services, should you have questions.</p>\n<p>We have assembled resources for faculty as we take courses fully online: (1) Keep Teaching serves as a faculty portal for accessing support resources and guidance as we migrate coursework. (2) Quick Path to Online Instruction provides information about faculty online training and textbook access, as well as five steps to move coursework and leverage Brightspace for asynchronous learning.</p>\n<p>Because many students cannot return to campus to retrieve their purchased books, faculty can scan and make PDFs of selections from their textbook and post the content into Brightspace. If you would like library assistance scanning and posting content from books or articles, please use the Course Reserves form. Because this is not usual practice, we appreciate your collective efforts to limit excerpted content to the specific time-bound needs of our LMU learning community. Faculty who require online access to videos should use the library’s Streaming Media Request form.

As of now, the summer calendar remains as listed on the academic calendar.</p>\n<p>Fall registration and fall housing deadlines</p>\n<p>Fall registration will begin April 6 for all undergraduate and graduate students. Students will receive new registration times by March 25. The fall university housing deadline will also be delayed; students will receive more information in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Room and board credits</p>\n<p>Students who are spring residence hall residents will receive a 50% credit to their Bursar account, which can be used for future tuition, room and board. Some exclusions apply; those students will be contacted separately. For those students who stayed in our residence halls after Spring Break, the credit will be prorated based on length of time living in the residence halls.</p>\n<p>The remaining meal balance for Loyalty 50 plans will be credited to students’ Bursar accounts. Individuals who would like to keep their plan active or donate their remaining meals to students facing food insecurity should email orl@marquette.edu by March 27.</p>\n<p>Students who have an Anytime Meal Plan will receive a 50% credit to their Bursar account. Individuals who would like to keep their Anytime Meal Plan active should email orl@marquette.edu by March 27.</p>\n<p>The goal is to have room and board credits processed by April 3.</p>\n<p>At the request of some of our Marquette parents, families may gift a portion or all of their room and board credit to support Marquette’s Bridge to the Future Fund to assist students experiencing unexpected financial need. Families who wish to support Marquette in this way can contact Missy Egelhoff at melissa.egelhoff@marquette.edu or (414) 288-6774 by March 27. Gifts, regardless of size, will help Marquette ensure our students have the resources they need during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Retrieval of students’ items from residence halls</p>\n<p>The Office of Residence Life will email students who had been living in the residence halls with specific instructions regarding a process to retrieve belongings, beginning March 25. The process will be managed to ensure social distancing best practices are followed and to limit the number of students moving out at any one time. If students are unable to come to campus in person, ORL has options to have their belongings packed and stored, at additional cost. If a shelter-in-place order from a state or local government is issued that affects Marquette, that may change the timing of when students may return to campus to retrieve their belongings. This is a fluid situation and we appreciate your flexibility and patience.</p>\n<p>A very limited number of students who do not have anywhere else to finish their remote studies will be allowed to remain in the residence halls.</p>\n<p>Remote work</p>\n<p>Remote work continues for faculty and staff. The university will continue to monitor the situation and follow guidance from state and local authorities.</p>\n<p>Events guidance</p>\n<p>All events held on the Marquette University campus are canceled through May 10.</p>\n<p>Commencement</p>\n<p>We have made the very difficult but necessary decision to postpone Marquette’s 139th Commencement ceremonies, including college-specific ceremonies. We know this is just the latest in a series of changes our campus community – and especially our graduating seniors – have had to face. As parents ourselves, we have experienced firsthand that Commencement is the culmination of years of hard work for our graduates and their families. To give this special occasion the pomp and circumstance it deserves, we want to celebrate Commencement together, in person, and in a safe and meaningful way. A team from across the university is working on options, including the likelihood of postponing the in-person celebration until August, and will be gathering feedback from spring 2020 graduates. We promise to be in touch with our spring 2020 graduates soon to share more details. With Commencement delayed, students who meet their graduation requirements will still have a graduation date of May 2020 on their diplomas. The university intends to mail diplomas by early June.</p>\n<p>Parking refunds</p>\n<p>Students: All students with commuter parking permits will receive a refund for 50% of the semester parking expense. Students with 24-hour parking permits must email the Parking Office by March 27 if they wish to cancel their parking permit and retrieve their car from campus by April 1 to receive a 50% refund. If students cancel their permits and remove their cars after April 1, the refund will be prorated.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff: The university will suspend collection of parking fees for those who pay to park in a campus parking structure or surface lot for the month of April, which will be reflected in April pay periods. The university will continue to assess parking as the situation evolves.</p>\n<p>In an effort to answer questions as quickly as possible, we have developed an extensive Frequently Asked Questions page on Marquette’s coronavirus website. Questions not addressed via the FAQs can be asked via this form or by calling Marquette Central at (414) 288-4000.</p>\n<p>Please continue to support one another in the spirit of cura personalis. Rev. Jim Voiss, S.J., vice president for mission and ministry, said it best in this video message: “Our challenge is to model our mission of excellence, faith, leadership and the spirit of service we embody at Marquette – even during these difficult times.” We are being tested as never before, and we’re grateful for everything you’re doing every day.

This is not a concern unique to Mines students, and has been a topic of discussion at the state level and between universities in Colorado.</p>\n<p>In recognition of this concern and after consideration of input from students, faculty and the state, Mines is offering its undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to choose a pass/no-pass (P/NP) grade option for any or all of the classes they are taking this semester, or to withdraw from any class by the final day of classes, Wednesday, April 29, 2020.</p>\n<p>Here are the key elements of the changes:</p>\n<p>All undergraduate and graduate students in every degree program may opt for a P/NP grade in any or all classes.</p>\n<p>“P” grades shall represent a letter grade of “C-” or higher, in accordance with statewide guidance from the Colorado Department of Higher Education. “NP” grades shall represent a letter grade of D+ or lower.</p>\n<p>Grades of “P” will be accepted to satisfy degree requirements. Grades of “P” or “NP” will not count as part of your grade point average (GPA).</p>\n<p>Students must opt-in to P/NP for each of their courses individually. If students do not indicate they want P/NP, they will still receive grades on the normal letter scale. Students will be allowed to choose P/NP for one or more classes and take grades for the rest.</p>\n<p>The deadline for students to declare a P/NP grade option or withdraw from a course is the last day of classes, Wednesday, April 29 by 5 p.m. MST . There will be no late requests for P/NP, nor can a student change their selection after this deadline.</p>\n<p>. Instructors will not be informed that students have chosen the P/NP option for a class. At the end of the semester, the instructor will submit letter grades for all students as normal. The letter grade will then be converted to “P” or “NP” by the Registrar’s Office for students who have chosen the P/NP option.</p>\n<p>Students are strongly encouraged to discuss the P/NP grading option with their academic advisors, who will help guide students considering the P/NP or withdrawal option. Students may also request assistance via the Center for Academic Services and Advising (CASA) at www.mines.edu/casa. Varsity athletes should speak with Dixie Cirillo at dcirillo@mines.edu prior to deciding as the P/NP option may impact NCAA eligibility.</p>\n<p>Before making any decisions, students should also understand the impact, if any, to continuation of their financial aid. Mines’ Office of Financial Aid is prepared to help students with that determination.</p>\n<p>A notation and/or attachment will be included on all student transcripts explaining the temporary policy change, to help ensure P/NP grades do not disadvantage students with graduate schools or employers.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience. Understandably, we wanted to share the news as soon as possible to give our students ample time to make the right decisions for them. To further aid in those deliberations, the Registrar will be adding details on the P/NP option to www.mines.edu/registrar in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Stay well and remember: You are not alone. At Mines, we climb together.</p>","id":"e568ed32-88a0-51c8-b4ce-25a3471a2eec","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-mines/2020-04-08-23_33_32/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"From the Provost: Pass/No-Pass Grade Option and Extended Withdrawal Deadline for Spring 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.mines.edu/wp-content/uploads/assets/icon_triangle_4c_r-512x512.png\"></p>\n<p>From the Registrar: Process Changes for Fall/Summer 2020 Registration</p>\n<p>The following message was sent to campus on 3/27/20:</p>\n<p>Dear Friends,</p>\n<p>As you know, registration begins on March 30th for the summer and fall semester.

Two, once consent is received, the departmental approver will need to enter the override into Banner. Three, follow the link in the email and select SUBMIT (approval forms may have more then one class listed, only approve your classes!) The approval in the workflow will notify the student so that they know that they have received permission and may then log in to Trailhead and register themselves.</p>\n<p>Until further notice the Office of the Registrar will accept all forms electronically.</p>\n<p>Requests should come from the student. The approver (faculty or department) will need to simply forward the email with the form attached along with the words, “I approve” in the body of the email and then send to registrar@mines.edu.

In particular, we are extremely concerned about students and faculty feeling compelled to work in conditions that are not being effectively managed to COVID-19 health guidance, as well as regular lab safety rules. Therefore, we have decided to take a more restrictive approach to on-campus research and ask that you suspend (safely) all on-campus research (laboratories, computer rooms, etc.) immediately.</p>\n<p>If you believe you have a compelling research-related reason to be on campus, please fill out and send the attached Excel form directly to Dean Mike Kaufman (for CH, CBE, CS, EE, ME, MME, and PH), Dean John Bradford (for AMS, CEE, GE, GP, MN, and PE), or Dean Kevin Moore (for EB, EDS, and HASS), with cc to your Department Head and – if you are a student – your advisor. The information requested is very similar to what many of you submitted previously so you should already have the information at hand, but going forward we specifically ask that students submit their own requests rather than having their advisors do so on their behalf.</p>\n<p>We will consider the requests on a case by case basis. Our process is consistent with the Governor’s latest Public Health Order (attached, higher education sections highlighted); we will re-assess after April 11, or as additional government rules and guidance are announced.</p>","id":"752c942c-4379-511f-b064-d649d05cc66b","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-mines/2020-04-08-23_33_47/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Research & Tech Transfer Office: Suspension of all on-campus research"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.mines.edu/wp-content/uploads/assets/icon_triangle_4c_r-512x512.png\"></p>\n<p>Colorado Stay-at-Home Order: Further Guidance on Campus Access and Remote Work Extension</p>\n<p>The following message was sent to all Mines faculty, staff and students on 3/25/20:</p>\n<p>Dear Mines Community:</p>\n<p>Governor Polis and local public health officials have issued additional guidance and directives that require us to update our expectations for remote work and campus access over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Effective March 26 at 6 a.m., the State of Colorado is under a stay-at-home order until April 11. This requires all Colorado residents to stay in their homes as much as possible and leave only for essential activities necessary to maintain health and well-being, such as getting groceries, obtaining medical care or medication, and engaging in outdoor activities like walking, hiking or running while following social distancing practices.</p>\n<p>Consistent with this order, Mines will remain open to support remote learning, essential functions and critical research laboratories with the following restrictions :</p>\n<p>Mines is extending its current remote work mode of operation through Friday, April 17 in line with Jefferson County’s public health order. Should state or local health officials extend stay-at-home orders, Mines will follow suit and lengthen its remote work provisions again.</p>\n<p>Mines is extending its suspension of campus events through April 18. Event organizers should be prepared to cancel/postpone campus gatherings of any size through the remainder of the semester, however, should public health guidance require it.</p>\n<p>As communicated earlier, effective Monday, March 30, all classes and exams will be conducted remotely using technology such as Canvas and Zoom through the end of the semester, to enable students to complete their spring courses.</p>\n<p>All employees who are not identified as providing critical services are expected to remain off campus and work remotely. Essential employees will continue supporting the students who remain on-campus, the faculty and assistants who are maintaining critical research labs, and the remote learning of our students. Supervisors should keep in close contact with staff who are working remotely so that they can contribute to our mission as an academic and research institution.</p>\n<p>All students are also expected to stay home and away from campus unless they are currently authorized to live in a residence hall or Mines Park, are supporting an essential function, have been identified by a principal investigator to maintain critical research labs, or require access to internet or other resources to support their online learning. Students with computers and internet access at home should participate in their classes from their homes so that Mines meets the requirements of all state and local health orders. Tutoring, office hours, meetings with faculty or colleagues, and group collaborations should be completed remotely using one of the many tools provided through Mines ITS.</p>\n<p>We all have a role to play in halting the spread of COVID-19. We urge all Mines community members to heed the directives of public health officials: In the coming weeks, please stay home as much as possible, avoid gatherings of any size, consolidate grocery shopping trips and practice proper social distancing whenever you do leave the house for outdoor exercise and/or essential shopping. Together, we can make a difference and together we will get through this.</p>","id":"3b39b52f-cbde-5c22-a6fe-59fe8f73caff","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-mines/2020-04-08-23_33_50/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Colorado Stay-at-Home Order: Further Guidance on Campus Access and Remote Work Extension"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.mines.edu/wp-content/uploads/assets/icon_triangle_4c_r-512x512.png\"></p>\n<p>From the President’s Office: Remote Work Operations Extended to April 26, 2020</p>\n<p>The following message was sent to Mines faculty, staff and graduate students on 4/8/20:</p>\n<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>\n<p>As many of you are aware, Governor Polis has signed an Executive Order extending Colorado’s stay at home order until April 26, 2020.

I realize the uncertainty is high and the stress even higher; I wish we had more definitive answers, but hope that walking through a few examples may help you as you look ahead.</p>\n<p>Scenario 1: Stay-at-home order continues as is for an extended period of time (at least through April 30 is very likely across the country; other states have put orders in place through early June):</p>\n<p>Under this scenario, we expect to allow more students and faculty to access research facilities over time. We are currently prioritizing time critical needs (e.g., immovable deadlines, or experiments that will fail without in-person care) and student deadlines as much as possible. We are also prioritizing research with a high home-to-campus ratio, where a small amount of work on campus enables a significant amount of work at home. We realize that requests that we had to turn down initially because they appeared less urgent will become urgent over time, and we are committed to re-evaluating all requests on a regular basis (initially 2 weeks, but on a more rapid cycle if we remain in this state for an extended period of time). As you submit your requests, consider when the go/no go date is where you must have access to campus or miss a critical deadline for fieldwork, or thesis submission. Your Deans and I are committed to getting you a final answer within 72 hours as long as we can get all the information we need, and we have been under 24 hours for most of you this past week.</p>\n<p>Scenario 2: A stricter stay-at-home order of unknown duration prevents all campus access:</p>\n<p>Should a complete lock down be ordered, with all research labs shuttered, we will work with you and help wherever possible to make sure you have the resources to do what research you can (and are comfortable with). We will also pull together on-line training opportunities, help facilitate remote seminars and collaborative discussions, and support proposal writing for anyone feeling so inspired. And, we will keep you updated on guidance from sponsors that impacts your funded research. Every indication from federal sponsors is that no-cost extensions on grants will be readily granted, along with significant flexibility for charging to grants regardless of research productivity. Having said that, there is no expectation of additional funding for any ongoing projects, so all deliverables would still need to be met with the same budget even if the timeline is more generous.</p>\n<p>Scenario 3: A more rapid release of restrictions than anticipated:</p>\n<p>Even when the global pandemic finally ebbs, no one is expecting a sudden return to normal activities and access. But as restrictions are lifted, regardless of when, we will increase access to research facilities as safely and quickly as possible , again using urgency of deadlines and impact of lost access for prioritizing who gets back to campus first.</p>\n<p>I know many of you are preparing contingency plans to address variations of the above scenarios. If you are questioning your assumptions or would like feedback on how your plan might work in the context of everyone else’s plans, feel free to reach out to me or anyone in the Research and Tech Transfer Office.</p>\n<p>As challenging as this time of uncertainty may be, I believe that we that will get through it and emerge stronger. It is my privilege to support the incredible research that you do, and the good that so much of it will eventually do for the world. In the meantime, thank you for your patience and perseverance.</p>","id":"5d8c2255-beb7-5d69-b65a-d8fdd5700ed2","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-mines/2020-04-10-14_02_37/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Office of Research and Tech Transfer: Updated guidance for on-campus research"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://covid19.mit.edu/themes/basis/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>March 31, 2020</p>\n<p>Follow-up to emergency academic regulations: Additional guidance re alternate grades</p>\n<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>\n<p>I hope that yesterday went well for you as we adjust to this new world of remote teaching and learning.</p>\n<p>As you know, the emergency academic regulations announced on March 15 mandate that “alternate grades” (PE, NE, and IE) be used in all subjects this semester. As instructors work on formulating plans for grading under the new system, questions have arisen as to how to interpret some of the emergency grading regulations. We have assembled the following to address several of the frequently asked questions that we have been receiving.</p>\n<p>(1) Can I give students letter grades as feedback on assignments and examinations?</p>\n<p>Yes, although you are not required to do so, and qualitative feedback (or qualitative translation of numerical scores) may be good alternatives. In any case, instructors should provide feedback to students in whatever form is most pedagogically helpful in their subject, taking into account the disrupted circumstances of this semester. That feedback should be sensitive to the fact that students will be differently impacted in their opportunity to demonstrate performance this spring.</p>\n<p>(2) Can I indicate a letter grade for a student as part of a letter of recommendation?</p>\n<p>No. Consistent with the mandatory requirement for alternate grades, specific letter grades should not be indicated in a letter of recommendation. However, instructors may craft recommendation letters that provide an evaluation of a student's level of achievement in words, without referring to a letter grade, and which reference the challenging circumstances a student may have overcome or experienced this semester.</p>\n<p>(3) How will grades be reported at the end of the semester?</p>\n<p>Faculty will be presented with a drop-down of grades according to whether their subject is full term, H4, or H3 or whether the subject is designated to use “J”, “U”, or “T” grades. For most full-term and H4 subjects, faculty will select from PE, IE, NE, or O. For a small subset of subjects (e.g., thesis, independent research, etc.), the additional grades of “J”, “U”, or “T” will also be available. For H3 subjects, instructors must choose between standard grades and alternate grades, and the system will not allow instructors to mix the grade types for different students in a class.</p>\n<p>(4) What happens to a grade of IE when it is subsequently completed?</p>\n<p>As discussed in the emergency academic regulations (long version), if a student receives a grade of IE and subsequently completes the work, the student’s grade will be changed to show IE/PE.</p>\n<p>(5) May I give all of the students in a class a grade of IE?</p>\n<p>This is strongly discouraged to avoid situations where a student has multiple incompletes pending after the end of the semester and in view of the uncertain situation with regard to the pandemic in the future.</p>","id":"181f7bc3-63d5-555e-8319-a565b8d3ff11","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-mit/2020-04-08-23_37_34/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Follow-up to emergency academic regulations: Additional guidance re alternate grades"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://covid19.mit.edu/themes/basis/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>March 27, 2020</p>\n<p>Undergraduate students: Welcome to remote learning at MIT</p>\n<p>Dear Undergraduates,</p>\n<p>Welcome back to a different kind of MIT.</p>\n<p>We would have loved to welcome you back in-person and on-campus but, with the advent of Covid-19, the welcome we are providing is to a new mode of learning. This new mode of learning is not one that any of us anticipated.</p>\n<p>The important thing is that we are, wherever we might be in the world, still together. Still part of a vibrant community. Still committed to our values and principles. Still quirky and creative. Teaching and learning is what we do, together. And, that is what we will be doing starting on Monday even though we are now together remotely.</p>\n<p>Remote learning does require us to be flexible and patient, to compromise, and to have an infinite supply of good humor and humility. Our number one piece of advice is rather simple: Be forgiving of yourself and others. At the same time, let’s make this as fantastic of a learning experience as we can.</p>\n<p>In the past few weeks, our faculty, instructors, TAs, and academic staff have worked tirelessly to bring 1200+ courses to virtual life. If you want to see a briefing for faculty on how they should prepare, watch this short video.</p>\n<p>As we told the faculty, our focus is on learning goals, with the vital caveat that not all of our standard goals can (or even should be attempted to) be achieved in this new mode.</p>\n<p>Some things to keep in mind</p>\n<p>Here are some things to keep in mind, whether you are taking a class or teaching one:</p>\n<p>Labs, project-based learning, and hands-on activities all pose challenges. Finding new ways to achieve some of the learning goals that we normally achieve in these ways will engage your creativity, as well as that of your instructors.</p>\n<p>Some of what we offer you will be asynchronous, with each of you choosing your own time for it just as you do with problem sets on campus. Now this will also include videotaped material. Some of your classes will be synchronous, typically live Zoom sessions.</p>\n<p>Since most of your instructors will be teaching from home, when you join them for your live Zoom lecture or seminar or discussion they will be welcoming you into their homes and you will be entering into their daily lives. Don’t be surprised if you encounter a kid or two in the background, spouses and partners might pop in and out of view, as may pets, and everything will not always go according to plan.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on the past two weeks here, we hope it doesn’t surprise you that preparing for remote learning is less about technology and is more about capturing the wonderfully complex ecosystem of MIT's creative educators across our unique departments. We have also been reflecting on how your learning transcends what we teach you, via all the things you do, all the ways you interact in the physical spaces of our campus, all the conversations and psetting and “accidental” meetings, and all the boba tea.</p>\n<p>Your Student Success Team</p>\n<p>With all this in mind (OK, not the boba tea) we are also introducing coaches into the mix. You will hear more soon, but in addition to connecting to MIT through instructors and an academic advisor as you always do you will each have a coach from MIT’s newly created Student Success Team. Your coach will meet with you one-on-one every week, keep you connected to the Infinite, and help you to find new ways for your remote learning to transcend our remote teaching.</p>\n<p>This will include not only checking in about your learning in classes, but connecting you with virtual resources for career services and professional development, experiential learning, IS&#x26;T, support services, and generally anything that will be helpful. Your coach might be a librarian, or a devoted staff member from one of the many student-facing offices at MIT or from a department, or for that matter an athletic coach! They will be there for you, to help you find answers, to connect you to each other and to MIT resources, and to provide a birds eye view of our virtual campus.</p>\n<p>Remote learning resources</p>\n<p>In addition, we have created a new remote learning resources website for students (<a href=\"http://learnremote.mit.edu\">http://learnremote.mit.edu</a>). For example, we know from past studies, that one of the most challenging parts of remote learning is scheduling and time management. The ebb and flow of the campus will be missing and silent, and that can be strange and disorienting.</p>\n<p>Thus, managing your time will be essential because each of your classes will have their own mix of elements and each instructional team will bring a different set of plans and expectations. That’s as it should be. You will face a combination of the asynchronous and synchronous content and lectures. You will be contacted by instructors at different times and sometimes in different modalities. Each of you will have to manage unique constraints, depending on where you live, who you live with, and your own comfort with virtual teams.</p>\n<p>Learning together</p>\n<p>We expect the move to remote teaching will be educational in a different sense, as it is, by necessity, more personal and raw than in a 250 seat classroom. Yes, this will be hard, but a different kind of hard. You might be disappointed in missing out on a lab section, on using a particular tool, or even your favorite study space. But, at the same time, you and we may learn more than ever before.</p>\n<p>We all need to set different, not lesser, expectations as we build our virtual learning community together.</p>\n<p>In closing, we expect that we will find ways in which this is an unprecedented opportunity. We all are honest enough, though, to admit this is not a situation we would choose. We miss all of you.

The ebb and flow of the campus will be missing and silent, and that can be strange and disorienting.</p>\n<p>We would also encourage those of you who are supporting teaching to dive into (<a href=\"http://teachremote.mit.edu\">http://teachremote.mit.edu</a>) for resources, tools, and support for teaching remotely at MIT.</p>\n<p>Working together</p>\n<p>We expect the move to remote teaching will be educational in a different sense, as it is, by necessity, more personal and raw than in a 250 seat classroom. Yes, this will be hard, but a different kind of hard. You might be disappointed in missing out on a lab section, on using a particular tool, or even your favorite study space. But, at the same time, you and we may learn more than ever before.</p>\n<p>We all need to set different, not lesser, expectations as we build our virtual learning community together.</p>\n<p>In closing, we expect that we will find ways in which this is an unprecedented opportunity. We all are honest enough, though, to admit this is not a situation we would choose. We miss all of you.

We miss seeing everyone on campus, and like you, we have been working remotely for some time now. One way that we hoped we could stay connected is through the launch of the Student Success Coaching Program through which you will be matched with a dedicated MIT staff or faculty member — your coach — who will help you and other students stay connected to the Infinite. Coaches will serve as a resource to help you transition successfully to an online MIT experience.</p>\n<p>Your coach will check in with you once a week by a 15-minute Zoom or phone conversation to see how you are doing and to help answer any questions you might have. They can also connect you to virtual offerings, including opportunities for career and professional development, experiential learning, and alumni who share similar interests. Through training and their knowledge of MIT, they will be able to refer you to support resources that can help you thrive in your remote learning.</p>\n<p>While coaches may be able to help you adjust to the new academic environment, they are not intended to replace other people who you are already working with, including advisors, deans, clinicians, and friends, and they are meant to complement, but not replace, other campus resources. We also recognize there are many communities that are already offering similar opportunities for their students (including students creating these on their own!), and we expect those to continue.</p>\n<p>If you do not want to participate in the coaching program, please respond to your coach’s initial outreach to let them know that you are not interested so we have accurate information about who is involved. You may also email studentsuccess@mit.edu if you would like to be matched with a different coach or have any questions about the program.</p>\n<p>We hope you will enjoy the Student Success Coaching Program and will find the resources you need.

We are in unprecedented times, requiring each of us to make good decisions for the benefit of all.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, good hygiene practices will also increase the likelihood of staying healthy, especially as you go to places where you will interact with other people. When you are out taking care of essential business, be sure to practice good handwashing techniques, avoid touching your face, and maintain at least 6 feet between yourself and other people. In addition, the CDC recently revised their <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\">recommendations about masks</a>; they now recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).

Click here to read the full memo.</p>\n<p>If you have questions regarding the new COVID-19-related leave provisions, please contact your college, division or unit HR representative or University Human Resources. For more COVID-19 guidelines and resources, visit the HR website.</p>\n<p>Facility Closures and Changes</p>\n<p>To support physical distancing and to help slow the spread of COVID-19, NC State has implemented the following facility changes and updates.</p>\n<p>Effective March 30 at 5 p.m., Talley Student Union is closed until further notice. For specific needs or questions related to Talley Student Union or Witherspoon Student Center services, please contact the virtual information desk at uscinformationdesk@ncsu.edu.</p>\n<p>Effective March 30 at 5 p.m. and until further notice, D.H. Hill Jr. Library is closed, but the Libraries’ expanded online collections and expanded services remain available. For information about the Libraries’ expanded online and technology services, visit the Libraries’ Coronavirus Response page.</p>\n<p>For dining needs, Fountain Dining Hall will be open limited hours from 10:30 a.m. – 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 – 7 p.m. daily for take-out only for the on-campus community.</p>\n<p>Student Health Services remains available to maintain ongoing health care (such as medication refills, follow-up regarding laboratory tests and brief questions) via secure messaging in the Healthy Pack Portal. A limited number of in-person appointments for acute illness are available for students and need to be made by calling 919-515-2563. Visit the Student Health Services website for more information.</p>\n<p>The Wolfpack One Card Office has moved its operations to Fountain Dining Hall, 10:30 a.m. – 1:30 p.m. Monday through Friday or by appointment by calling 919-515-3090.</p>\n<p>All NC State Stores physical locations (Wolfpack Outfitters, Wolf Xpress, State of the Art) are closed, but online stores are open at ncsu.edu and shop.gopack.com.</p>\n<p>Keep up with campus facilities and services hours and operations on the university’s coronavirus response web site.</p>\n<p>Tracking and Reporting COVID-19 Cases</p>\n<p>The efforts made by the university to reduce campus population and encourage social distancing, combined with other preventative health measures can help keep you, your loved ones and our entire community safe. However, there will inevitably be several in our broad community who test positive for the virus.</p>\n<p>University health officials have recently confirmed that a handful of members of the Wolfpack have tested positive and are either in isolation, receiving care or recovering away from campus. None of these individuals have been on campus or been in contact with other members of the campus community while ill.</p>\n<p>As COVID-19 continues to spread and we learn about additional positive cases, know that our health professionals will follow up on each one to determine if there is any risk to our on-campus community, regardless of where the individual lives. Going forward, we will only send notification of cases that have direct impacts to campus.</p>\n<p>If you test positive for COVID-19, or are told by a healthcare provider that you are presumed positive for the virus, we encourage you to let us know by filling out one of the appropriate forms for students or for faculty/staff. This information is completely voluntary and confidential – it helps university healthcare professionals monitor the impact to the campus community and provide any resources and support you might need wherever you are.</p>\n<p>Reimbursements for Housing and Dining</p>\n<p>Yesterday, NC State announced that we will be providing prorated refunds to students for their unused housing and dining plans this semester.</p>\n<p>Since costs of specific housing and dining plans vary per student, once determined, the credit will be posted to the student account.</p>\n<p>It will take some time for the university to calculate reimbursements and we will update you with specifics about the timing of refunds in the upcoming weeks.</p>\n<p>Stay Alert for More Information</p>\n<p>As NC State navigates through this unprecedented time, please stay alert for more important communications in the days ahead. In the meantime, keep up with COVID-19 related updates, information and a growing collection of helpful resources at www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all you are doing to keep NC State safe, healthy and moving forward.</p>","id":"eab53c1e-e7f6-5dc1-ad71-be279e0951a9","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ncsu/2020-04-08-23_32_24/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Campus COVID-19 Update March 31, 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.ncsu.edu/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>NC State Students and Parents,</p>\n<p>We are pleased to inform you that NC State will provide prorated refunds to students for their unused housing and dining plans this semester.</p>\n<p>During a special meeting of the UNC Board of Governors today, Interim President Bill Roper announced that the UNC System is committed to prorated reimbursements of housing and dining as a result of the University System’s rapid response to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Since costs of specific housing and dining plans vary per student, once determined, the credit will be posted to the student account.

As you know, this situation continues to rapidly change, including new directives regarding the size of gatherings and other actions coming from the CDC, the White House and Governor Cooper, and new guidance from the UNC System.</p>\n<p>I have a significant update today that will change our campus operations for some time. Following the direction released today from UNC System Interim President Bill Roper, in order to protect the safety and health of the campus community and limit the spread of COVID-19, NC State is implementing significant actions to limit the number of people on campus.</p>\n<p>The university will remain open with minimal on-campus operations, which includes limiting students on campus, moving fully to online courses, requiring remote or alternative work arrangements for the majority of employees, and closing or significantly limiting core services and facilities.</p>\n<p>To be direct, until further notice, if you don’t need to be on campus, you shouldn’t be on campus. Specifics follow.</p>\n<p>Campus Housing and Dining</p>\n<p>Effective immediately and throughout the remainder of the spring semester, NC State students who occupy university housing are instructed to remain at or return to their permanent off-campus residences, unless granted an exception. Residential facilities will remain open until 5 p.m. Sunday, March 22. If you are on campus currently, please make plans to return to your permanent residence by this date. If you are currently away from campus, you have until this date to return to campus to gather essential items only. You do not have to move all of your belongings out immediately.</p>\n<p>Students who have no other housing option must complete a Special Circumstance Housing Request Form by Thursday, March 19 at Noon. One of the following criteria must be met in order to remain in on-campus housing:</p>\n<p>International students Those experiencing housing insecurity, or Those with personal extenuating circumstances</p>\n<p>University Housing and Fraternity and Sorority Life will send additional information and specific guidance directly to on-campus residents later today.</p>\n<p>Minimal campus dining facilities will remain open to serve the small number of students who receive an on-campus housing exception and employees maintaining campus operations. The dining facilities will transition operations to provide takeout or similar options.</p>\n<p>Any decisions about refunds for housing and dining fees will be made by the UNC System after the immediate needs of safety and security are addressed.</p>\n<p>Other Campus Facilities and Services</p>\n<p>The Wellness and Recreation Center will be closed until further notice.</p>\n<p>Talley Student Union will be open with limited hours and limited dining options. Witherspoon Student Center will be closed until further notice.</p>\n<p>Hunt and Hill libraries will operate on restricted hours to continue core educational services.</p>\n<p>Student Health Services will be available to maintain ongoing health care (such as medication refills, follow-up of laboratory tests and brief questions) via secure messaging in the Healthy Pack Portal. Some acute medical consultation may be available in this manner on a case-by-case basis. A limited number of in-person appointments for acute illness in the Main Campus location are available for students and will need to be made by calling 919-515-2563.</p>\n<p>The Counseling Center will remain available for students by calling 919-515-2423. All services will be available remotely through phone or video. The center will not be open for walk-ins or face-to-face meetings with students.</p>\n<p>The university has plans in place to keep research operations, labs and related facilities operational. Additional information will follow for appropriate employees.</p>\n<p>NC State University Police will remain fully operational.</p>\n<p>Campus facility availability and hours are subject to change.

For the remainder of the semester, all NC State courses will be completed online. There will be no face-to-face class, laboratory or other instruction for the rest of this semester. Students are instructed to remain off-campus and complete their courses online.</p>\n<p>Students, we know you can be successful and we are here to support in every way possible. You will be hearing directly from your professors this week about your classes and their transition to online learning. We understand that this is likely a stressful time for you. Please be patient and know that we will be adjusting some course policies, such as schedule revisions, so that you can make any needed changes to your courses once you have talked with your professors in more detail. We will provide additional information on policy updates as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>This is a fluid situation, and we are working hard to find the best ways to help you complete your semester or degree. We will do everything we can to assure you can complete your courses successfully and graduate on time.</p>\n<p>Remote Work and new COVID-19 Leave Provisions</p>\n<p>Given the growing concerns over COVID-19, the system and university are adjusting our recent guidance about remote and alternative work options. Effective immediately and until further notice, only mandatory employees who need to report to work on campus should do so. All non-mandatory employees – including temporary employees and student workers – will continue to be assigned work and will be expected to work remotely to the fullest extent possible.</p>\n<p>For this COVID-19 issue, the definition of mandatory employee is changing to: employees who are directed by their supervisor to report to work, at a designated university worksite other than their personal residence, at specific dates and times. It is possible that an employee will have a portion of duties that are on campus and can fulfill the remainder of their duties remotely.</p>\n<p>Supervisors are responsible for assigning mandatory employees, and for assigning and tracking their employees’ remote work. To be clear, these changes do not remove employees’ responsibilities to complete their work assignments.</p>\n<p>Mandatory and non-mandatory employees – including temporary employees and student workers – who cannot work remotely because of childcare or eldercare needs due to COVID-19-related school and facility closings will receive paid administrative leave until March 31, 2020, for the period of time they are unavailable to work.</p>\n<p>Additionally, non-mandatory employees – including temporary employees and student workers – who are unable to work remotely because their position duties cannot be performed remotely, will receive paid administrative leave until March 31, 2020, for the period of time they are unable to work remotely.</p>\n<p>Any employees who are sick due to symptoms of a cold, flu, or COVID-19 or who are caring for a dependent with such symptoms will receive paid administrative leave through March 31, 2020.</p>\n<p>More information about the new COVID-19 Faculty and Staff Leave Provisions is available online from Human Resources.</p>\n<p>Next Steps</p>\n<p>I understand these are big changes and this is a lot to absorb. As I previously mentioned, this is an unprecedented and rapidly changing situation. We will provide additional information to students, faculty and staff over the coming days as it becomes available.</p>\n<p>Please make a point to stay informed on a daily basis. As we all move toward a new reality in the days and weeks ahead, it is important that we all stay updated on measures we can take to protect ourselves, and stay abreast of updates from campus. Visit www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus for regular updates and a growing list of helpful information and resources for the campus community.</p>\n<p>I realize that this is not the spring term that any of us hoped for or planned. The weeks ahead will be challenging – not just because of these changes, but because most of us will be away from the people, places and spaces that make up our community. I truly believe there are still many ways we can come together and support each other from a distance, and I encourage you to do that.</p>\n<p>Please stay safe, take care of yourselves, and do all you can to protect yourselves, your families and friends, and of course, our Pack. We’ll be in touch with more information in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Randy Woodson, Chancellor</p>","id":"7fd2f128-a295-5ac4-8ac8-f1a3148873a7","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ncsu/2020-04-08-23_32_33/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"NC State Limiting People on Campus, Moving All Classes Online"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.ncsu.edu/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>NC State Community and Friends,</p>\n<p>In response to the spread of COVID-19, and to help ensure the health and safety of the campus and broader community, NC State is canceling all university-related in-person academic, athletic and 4-H summer 2020 camps for K-12 students.

John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., announced that the University Commencement Ceremony on May 17 will be held online rather than in Notre Dame Stadium, and that an on-campus celebration has been scheduled for the spring of 2021.</p>\n<p>Father Jenkins made the decision after discussions with experts on infectious diseases, University deans, and student government and class officers as he continued to monitor the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>\n<p>“Although there remains a good deal of uncertainty about the trajectory and duration of the pandemic” Father Jenkins wrote, “it is becoming clear that it would not be prudent to host on May 16-17 the Notre Dame Commencement on our campus — a large gathering bringing together families from across the country and around the world, many with older or at-risk members.</p>\n<p>“The Notre Dame Commencement and the events leading up to it mean so much to our graduates, their families, our faculty and to me personally, and so it is with greatest regret that I tell you we will not be able to gather you on campus for Commencement this May.”</p>\n<p>In order to ensure that the graduates’ degrees are conferred and certified in May for the purposes of employment or further studies, Notre Dame will live-stream a ceremony May 17. The commencement speaker, His All-Holiness Bartholomew, Orthodox Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch, and others will be asked to record remarks for the graduates.</p>\n<p>After speaking with Class of 2020 officers, Father Jenkins also announced that the University plans to bring this year’s graduates back to campus on Memorial Day weekend 2021 to, in his words, “spend time with your friends, classmates, faculty and others who have been part of your Notre Dame experience … and celebrate your accomplishments.” Details will be announced in coming months.</p>\n<p>In closing his letter, Father Jenkins harkened back to graduates of Notre Dame’s Class of 1879, who were sent home before the end of the semester when a fire in April destroyed the Main Building, which at the time housed much of the University’s academic, housing, dining, administrative and other functions.</p>\n<p>“The University, and that class, arose from the ashes of 1879 even stronger,” Father Jenkins wrote. “You will as well.”</p>\n<p>Originally published by Dennis Brown at news.nd.edu on .</p>","id":"87fab470-8c62-50a6-b193-66aa063bdaec","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-nd/2020-04-08-23_44_22/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Notre Dame commencement to be held online; on-campus celebration scheduled for spring 2021"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://coronavirus.nd.edu/stylesheets/themes/ndt/v3/images/ph-dome-1200x800.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Dear Graduate and Professional Students of the Class of 2020:</p>\n<p>I write now to you a letter I had hoped I would not need to send. We have all been following the news about the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and I have consulted with several experts on infectious diseases. Although there remains a good deal of uncertainty about the trajectory and duration of the pandemic, it is becoming clear that it would not be prudent to host on May 16-17 the Notre Dame Commencement on our campus—a large gathering bringing together families from across the country and around the world, many with older and at-risk members. The Notre Dame Commencement weekend means so much to our graduates, their families, our faculty and to me personally, and so it is with greatest regret that I tell you we will not be able to gather you on campus for Commencement this May.</p>\n<p>Despite this disappointing turn of events, we remain committed to honoring and celebrating the hard work and effort that has culminated in the doctoral and master’s degrees that you have so rightly earned. We will approach our celebration of these achievements in stages. Because you will need your degrees conferred and certified in May in order to pursue your post-Notre Dame plans, we will hold an on-line ceremony on the originally scheduled date of May 17. This will include a recorded address by the University’s Commencement speaker, and a conferral on you by me of your degrees via live-stream.</p>\n<p>Although the on-line ceremony and conferral will be important, we also want to gather in person and give you the opportunity to celebrate your achievements with your fellow graduates, faculty, family and friends. We will, then, invite you back to campus on Memorial Day Weekend 2021, when the University will recognize all the members of the Class of 2020. In addition to a number of other celebrations that weekend, we envision the following in terms of formal recognition of your accomplishments:</p>\n<p>For the Graduate School programs, a ceremony much like we would typically hold, to include hooding for our doctoral recipients and individual recognition and a walk across the stage for our master’s recipients.</p>\n<p>For the Mendoza School of Business, a graduate business diploma ceremony similar to the typical ceremony we would hold.</p>\n<p>For the Law School, a doctoral hooding ceremony and honors convocation.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the School of Architecture, a ceremony that will bring together all the graduates of the School of Architecture as we do every year, graduate and undergraduate. This will include individual recognition of each graduate of the School and other events that are typically part of the School’s graduation traditions.</p>\n<p>In the coming weeks and months, the deans of these schools will provide further communications about these ceremonies and celebrations. We hope that by giving you a good deal of advance notice of the date, you and your families can plan accordingly.</p>\n<p>Again, I am so sorry to have to deliver this message to you, but I believe we can make these celebrations special at every stage. Those who graduate from Notre Dame in 2020 will have something in common with the Notre Dame Class of 1879, when students were sent home abruptly on April 23rd after a terrible fire left the campus in ashes. The University, and those students, arose from the ashes of 1879 even stronger. You will as well. The 2020 Class of graduates will always have a special place in the hearts of all who are part of Notre Dame. I look forward to the celebrations to come. Through our patroness, Mary, I ask for God’s blessing on each of you and on your loved ones in this trying time.</p>\n<p>In Notre Dame,</p>\n<p>Rev. John I.

We will, then, invite you back to campus on Memorial Day weekend 2021 to gather as a class and to celebrate your accomplishments. We are currently thinking of a gathering that will begin on Thursday and conclude on Sunday, but we will be working with a group of student leaders to plan the details of that event. Although we know that by then you are likely to be working, or engaged in further studies or service, I hope you can take several days to gather as a class, spend time together on campus and—albeit belatedly—mark together your graduation as the Notre Dame Class of 2020. In the coming weeks and months, we will have further communications about that gathering and celebration.

Numerous faculty members have relayed to me stories of your patience, resilience, and good humor as you resumed your classes online this week. I am grateful to you for that as well as for your efforts in many distant locations to maintain the strong sense of community we work so hard to build at Notre Dame.</p>\n<p>In the many years I have served as Notre Dame’s provost, I have not had the occasion to write to you as a group. I do so today to share with you several important adjustments we are making to respond to the upheaval caused by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>\n<p>Earlier today, the University’s Academic Council approved several temporary amendments to the academic codes that govern grading for undergraduate and graduate students, and several other temporary adjustments to policies as outlined below. I encourage you to view these measures not as an easing of our academic standards, but instead as an acknowledgement that we are all learning and growing together as a University community in the face of the challenges presented by the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Changes to Undergraduate Student Grading for the Spring 2020 Semester. This semester undergraduate students will have the opportunity to view their final course grades at the end of the semester, and then choose whether to accept their letter grades or elect a pass/no credit option. Those receiving a letter grade of A through D can choose to receive a pass (P); those receiving an F grade can choose to receive a no credit (NC). Pass and no-credit grades will have no effect on a student’s grade point average. Undergraduates may make this choice for any or all of their courses. The Registrar will provide in the near future administrative instructions for choosing the pass/no credit option. This grading option does not apply to courses completed prior to spring break.</p>\n<p>Temporary Expansion of Leave of Absence Policy for Undergraduates. For the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester, any undergraduate student who withdraws from classes due to a specific COVID-19-related concern will be granted a leave of absence and be allowed to automatically re-enroll in the fall. The leave is subject to the approval of the dean of the student’s primary degree-seeking college or school, or the dean’s designee. The student must return to the degree program by the first class day of the Fall 2020 semester. Post-baccalaureate students should refer to their college or school for leave policies specific to their degree program.</p>\n<p>Changes to Graduate Student Grading for the Spring 2020 Semester. Graduate students, after viewing their final grades, can choose to accept their letter grades or choose a pass/no credit option. Those receiving a letter grade of A through C can choose to receive a pass (P); those receiving a letter grade C- through F can choose to receive a no credit (NC).

Deek, Provost and Senior Executive Vice President</p>\n<p>Date: Wednesday, March 25, 2020</p>\n<p>RE: Special Final Grading Policy Provisions for Spring 2020</p>\n<p>As you know, our university community has been responsive to this unexpected pandemic by instituting measures that will protect and save lives. Now, as we return from spring break to continue our semester remotely, the university will institute modifications to undergraduate and graduate final grading policies for Spring 2020. These temporary changes are a response to the extraordinary situation created by mandated actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>These important changes are summarized below:</p>\n<p>At the end of the Spring 2020 semester, students will temporarily see the actual grades they have earned on their transcript. Subsequently,</p>\n<p>Undergraduate Courses</p>\n<p>1a. On May 31, 2020 all F’s will be automatically converted to NAD (not academic credit). Students will have the ability to repeat the course as many times as the policy allows, as if the Spring 2020 take did not occur. The GPA will not be affected by NAD</p>\n<p>1b. On May 31, 2020 all D’s will be automatically converted to “Academic Credit” shown as AC. The course will count towards graduation/degree completion provided the student does not need a higher grade as a prerequisite for subsequent courses. Students will be given the option to convert the AC to D. A student can repeat the course, the AC attempt counts as one trial. The AC will not be affecting the GPA.</p>\n<p>1c. Grades of C or higher will have the ability to be changed. The student will have the option of converting the actual grade to “Pass” shown as P.</p>\n<p>1d. Students will have the opportunity to make changes only once and the changes must be submitted by May 31, 2020. Details of how changes will be submitted will appear later on the Registrar’s web site.</p>\n<p>Graduate Courses</p>\n<p>1e. On May 31, 2020 F’s will be automatically converted to NAD (not academic credit). Students will have the ability to repeat the course as many times as the policy allows, as if the Spring 2020 take did not occur. The GPA will not be affected by NAD</p>\n<p>1f. On May 31, 2020 all C’s will be automatically converted to “Academic Credit” shown as AC. The course will count towards graduation/degree completion provided the student does not need a higher grade because it is a prerequisite for subsequent courses or is a core course explicitly requiring a higher grade. Students will be given the option to convert the AC to C. A student can repeat the course, the AC attempt counts as one trial. The AC will not be affecting the GPA.</p>\n<p>1g. Grades of A and B will have the ability to be changed. The student will have the option of converting the actual grade to “Pass” shown as P.</p>\n<p>1h. Students will have the opportunity to make changes only once and the changes must be submitted by May 31, 2020. Details of how changes will be submitted will appear later on the Registrar’s web site.</p>\n<p>1i. Students who cannot complete their MS Thesis or MS Project work in Spring 2020 will be dealt with on a case by case basis. Their research advisor will need to contact the Graduate Studies Office with appropriate justification; otherwise, the NAD grade will be posted. Students will have the ability to repeat the course as many times as the policy allows, as if the Spring 2020 take did not occur.</p>\n<p>Graduate Courses taken by Undergraduate Students</p>\n<p>Graduate courses taken by undergraduate students as part of a BS/MS program or as an elective (by approval) will follow the policies outlined in 1e – 1i above.</p>\n<p>Bridge Courses</p>\n<p>A list of courses considered as Bridge Courses will soon appear on the Registrar’s web site and will follow the following rules.</p>\n<p>1j. On May 31, 2020 all grades lower than B will be automatically converted to NAD (not academic credit). Students will have the ability to repeat the course as many times as the policy allows, as if the Spring 2020 take did not occur. The GPA will not be affected by NAD</p>\n<p>1k. Grades of B or higher will have the ability to be changed. The student will have the option of converting the actual grade to “Pass” shown as P.</p>\n<p>1l. Students will have the opportunity to make changes only once and the changes must be submitted by May 31, 2020. Details of how changes will be submitted will appear later on the Registrar’s web site.</p>\n<p>Graduation GPA Requirements</p>\n<p>The use of letter grading may lead to instances in which a student who is to graduate does not meet the minimum GPA requirement (2.0 for undergraduates; 3.0 for graduate students).Because of this reason the departmental academic advisors may waive the aforementioned GPA requirements for graduation.</p>\n<p>For students to earn a distinction such as Presidential Medal or Dean’s List must have all their actual grades on the transcript. Presence of a P will automatically disqualify the student for an academic distinction. The disqualification for the Dean’s List is for Spring 2020 only.</p>\n<p>The Academic Standing of students will be initially determined through the actual grades. Students who through their actual grades improve their Academic Standing relative to the earlier semester will see the improved standing on their transcript. Students who fail to improve their Academic Standing via their actual grade, will have the same Academic Standing as at the end of Fall 2019. Therefore, a student’s academic standing may either improve or remain the same when evaluated at the end of the spring semester. For example, a student who receives an academic warning can be placed on good standing, but is not at risk of being placed on probation. The policies will be modified so that this will not count against the student in the future. For undergraduate students not in Good Standing after Spring 2020, resources will be available to help them as per the usual protocol.</p>\n<p>The timeline for students who are currently on suspension has not changed. They may apply for reinstatement after being off-campus for at least one semester (i.e., they can apply for reinstatement/readmission to continue their studies starting in Fall 2020).</p>\n<p>Students who received an Incomplete in Fall 2019 and/or Winter 2019/2020 will have extra time to remove it. Instead of removing it by the end of Spring 2020, or it will be converted to F, the deadline will be extended to August 15, 2020. Incompletes remaining as such after August 15 will be automatically converted to F without the possibility of appeal. Students who have an Incomplete in a course they plan to take in the summer, will need to remove it by the end of this semester (as usual) or they will have to make alternate plans for the summer courses they were planning to take.</p>\n<p>Because of the unprecedented circumstances and the state of emergency we are in, students have to follow the proctoring method their instructors (with the approval of chairs) have chosen. If they have any issue with the proctoring method, students are given the option to withdraw with permission from the Dean of Students. This will be shown on the transcript as WP and will not count towards the number of attempts a student has at a course. There will be no financial credit for students opting for the WP option.</p>\n<p>Withdrawals other than the WP which will require the approval of the Dean of Students’ Office will be handled in the usual way and they will be counting as one attempt at the course.</p>\n<p>We hope these changes will alleviate some of the stresses our students are facing as they adjust to the sudden change in instructional mode. Let me also take this opportunity to praise our community members who continue to keep our university functioning in support of our teaching mission. I am certain that we will come back together again soon, determined, optimistic, and more resilient.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Fadi</p>","id":"8661aba8-77d1-59a4-918f-3ef0c19c849f","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-njit/2020-04-08-23_36_56/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Special Final Grading Policy Provisions for Spring 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.njit.edu/healthservices/sites/all/themes/njit_v1_2/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>March 20, 2020</p>\n<p>NJIT Community Members,</p>\n<p>Allow me to provide you with updates regarding Commencement and credits for housing, meal plans, and parking.</p>\n<p>Commencement</p>\n<p>Our Commencement marks an annual highlight for the entire NJIT community and is particularly meaningful for the students who graduate that day, as well as to their families and loved ones. The members of the Class of 2020 should be sharing milestones and traditions with one another this Spring but cannot because of what is an unprecedented threat to our collective wellbeing. At a time when it is our university community's strong desire to come together, it is absolutely necessary that we remain physically apart. I am committing to you, though, that NJIT will do two things with the Class of 2020. First, NJIT will work to develop a virtual commencement on the previously scheduled dates that will be as meaningful and engaging as possible. Second, NJIT will plan to honor the Class of 2020 with an in-person Commencement ceremony at such a time as it is safe. The determination of how and when to accomplish this will be informed by the guidance provided by the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Task Force and its advisory committee, which includes student, faculty and staff representatives from throughout our campus community.</p>\n<p>Housing, Meal Plans, and Parking Credits</p>\n<p>Students who reside in campus housing and/or have purchased meal plans and/or have paid for parking on campus for the Spring 2020 semester will receive prorated housing, meal plan, and parking credits to their student account for the period of Monday, March 23 through Friday, May 15 due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial aid and scholarship policies may impact your credit. Details regarding the terms and conditions of the credit, and refunds to graduating students, will be posted to the Bursar’s and Financial Aid websites no later than March 27.</p>\n<p>A True Community</p>\n<p>NJIT community members, though we are separated at this time, we know that we are part of a large and close-knit community. These are stressful and difficult times, but we have and will continue to support one another as we work through the challenges we face. Thank you all for your commitment to NJIT and your hard work. We look forward to the time when we will be in one another’s company again. Please stay safe and well.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>NJIT President Joel S.

The well-being of our students, faculty, and staff is our top priority and we appreciate your patience as we respond to the global COVID-19 pandemic. We recognize this is a stressful time and many of you have questions about the move to online instruction. I want to answer some of these questions and outline what you can expect for the remainder of this semester.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, NJIT is committed to keeping our community safe while delivering a quality education. It is important to us that you are able to stay on track with your academic progress. We also want to recognize all the hard work that you have already put into this semester.</p>\n<p>To that purpose, your instructors have been working on their plans to move your courses online over the past two weeks. If you have not already heard from them, you should – by next week - be receiving communications from them outlining their plans for the rest of the semester.</p>\n<p>We ask that you be patient throughout the first week of online classes as we all make this adjustment together. We will need to be flexible as we may experience some bumps along the way, but be assured that we will not compromise on the quality of your NJIT education.</p>\n<p>While each teaching plan will be a little different, here are some tips/suggestions:</p>\n<p>Learning Management System (Canvas and Moodle): Most instructors will use either Canvas or Moodle to share readings, lectures, and other course materials. They will communicate to you which tool your class will be using. You can log into both Canvas and Moodle with your UCID and password and should check your courses daily to keep an eye out for updates and announcements.</p>\n<p>Video Conferencing (Webex): Many classes will use video conferencing technology to deliver course lectures. We will use this opportunity to become comfortable participating in video conferences - both with the technical mechanics as well as the etiquette. This experience will help prepare you to use these tools professionally. As such, here are some suggestions:</p>\n<p>Prepare a professional and organized work space - this is especially important if you will be using a web camera.</p>\n<p>Let roommates or family members know that you will be on a video conference.</p>\n<p>Keep your microphone muted when you are not speaking.</p>\n<p>If you experience video lag, turn off your web camera and/or hide the participant’s video.</p>\n<p>Join the conference before it is scheduled to start.</p>\n<p>If your class is using Webex, you will receive a meeting link from your instructor. For more information on joining a meeting, please see the following guide: Participating in a Webex meeting.</p>\n<p>Quizzes and Assignments (Respondus and Proctor U): Depending upon the course material, you may be asked to upload assignments to Canvas/Moodle and/or take proctored online exams. Proctoring tools will be used to ensure the same level of integrity for online and face-to-face courses. This is a standard practice and not something we do because we do not trust our students. Given the unexpected nature of this situation, NJIT will be covering the cost of proctored exams.</p>\n<p>The proctoring solutions are the same ones that we use to deliver NJIT’s fully online programs. These solutions adhere to best practices for online learning and academic integrity and are an industry standard across institutions within higher education.</p>\n<p>Respondus is an online exam monitoring software that uses artificial intelligence for proctoring. Students show their NJIT ID before taking an exam and any potential violations are flagged for later review by the instructor.</p>\n<p>ProctorU is an online proctoring service that uses both artificial intelligence and human proctors. Proctoring is done via webcam and screen activity is monitored.</p>\n<p>Specialized Software: We are working with software companies to provide remote access to specialized software that would normally be available in NJIT’s computer labs. Each arrangement is different. Your instructors will provide more information as it is available.</p>\n<p>Labs: These are being handled differently on department by department basis. More information will be available next week.</p>\n<p>Time Management: It can be easy to fall behind in a course when you aren’t physically in class every week. Log into the learning management system every day to check your course for announcements, updates, and new materials, and use your scheduled face-to-face “meeting times” to focus on work for each class. Make a schedule of assignments and due dates in a calendar or planner.</p>\n<p>If you have concerns about online proctoring or access to resources (e.g. computers or the internet) please contact the Dean of Students <a href=\"https://www5.njit.edu/doss/contact.php\">https://www5.njit.edu/doss/contact.php</a>. If you need assistance with a technical problem, please contact the Service Desk by visiting servicedesk.njit.edu, emailing servicedesk@njit.edu, or calling (973) 596-2900.</p>\n<p>We appreciate your flexibility over the next few weeks. While this may not be the semester that we envisioned, we will succeed as a community.</p>","id":"c788c613-38a5-5375-83cf-33ab0777f038","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-njit/2020-04-08-23_37_03/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Message to our Students from Provost Deek"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.njit.edu/healthservices/sites/all/themes/njit_v1_2/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Dear NJIT Community Members,</p>\n<p>The Office of Residence Life recently was informed that an on-campus resident student who had previously returned home internationally has since tested positive for COVID-19. NJIT's facilities team has disinfected campus spaces that were visited by this community member, and the university has identified and informed, to the best of its ability, all members of the campus community who may have come in recent contact with the student who tested positive. Additionally, and per CDC guidelines, those notified of possible contact were directed to self-quarantine for 14 days from their last known contact and monitor their health.</p>\n<p>For those residing on-campus who needed to self-quarantine, those residents have self-quarantined in place to mitigate transmission concerns and have been provided all necessary resources, including food, water, and other requested items, while they attend classes virtually. It is important to note that none of these students have tested positive for COVID-19 or reported any symptoms thus far.</p>\n<p>While we will continue to communicate pertinent information, it is not our intent to distribute a campus message in each instance of an NJIT community member testing positive for COVID-19. We do want to encourage those who test positive to notify the NJIT COVID-19 Task Force by completing the form at <a href=\"https://forms.gle/EuQZQaaaJYTA6H8J8\">https://forms.gle/EuQZQaaaJYTA6H8J8</a> or by notifying the Office of Human Resources (employees) or the Office of the Dean of Students (students). As soon as any notification is received by NJIT, the university will move aggressively to complete the steps outlined below:</p>\n<p>NJIT will determine, to the best of its ability, when and where the community member's most recent visits to campus occurred. NJIT will notify, to the best of its ability, all known members of the campus community with whom contact/exposure may have occurred. NJIT’s facilities team will disinfect the campus spaces determined to have been visited by the community member who tested positive for COVID-19.</p>\n<p>We continue to encourage members of the NJIT community to practice social distancing and to follow the guidance of the CDC offered here with regard to prevention, including washing hands frequently.

We want you to know we have heard you. We understand how much this moment matters to you and your families, as the culmination of years of hard work and high achievement.</p>\n<p>Based on your feedback, we are working hard to find alternate dates and venues for in-person celebrations with you and your loved ones. We will develop plans based on your input and the evolving global situation. Please know that we are committed to hosting celebrations at all of our global campus locations at a future date, including Boston, Charlotte, London, Seattle, San Francisco, San Jose, Toronto and Vancouver. We also plan to find opportunities to celebrate in New York, Philadelphia, Austin, San Diego, Dubai, Hong Kong, and other locations as travel opens up.</p>\n<p>We, too, are deeply disappointed that we are unable to hold our in-person events this spring. We are buoyed by your responses, that you would be willing to rejoin us at a later date. In the meantime, you will, of course, receive your diplomas by mail this year. You will also receive a special mailing with commemorative items. Please be sure to hold on to those; you’ll want them for the festive events to come.</p>\n<p>Times of unprecedented challenge have a way of bringing out the best in the Northeastern community.

We know that many of you are handling a variety of commitments at the moment – family, personal pursuits and work. Regardless of where you are currently living, it is especially important at this time to take care of yourself while finding ways to stay connected with one another and your Northwestern community.</p>\n<p>We are writing now to provide important information concerning Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>Update your current address, phone number and emergency contact information</p>\n<p>Students are required to update your current address, phone number and emergency contact information. It is essential that we have up-to-date contact information to better understand where Northwestern students have settled in the last few weeks and to enable us to assist you in an emergency. Please update your local address, emergency notification phone number and emergency contact information in CAESAR by April 10.</p>\n<p>Spring Quarter Schedule</p>\n<p>As you know, Northwestern classes will be delivered remotely through at least May 4, with an announcement no later than April 17 about whether we will continue remote classes beyond May 4. We understand how important this decision is to you. The University continues to monitor the situation closely, and we will update you as soon as a decision is made. Any students who are unable to return to campus to resume in-person attendance will be allowed to continue their classes remotely.</p>\n<p>Spring Grading and Deadlines</p>\n<p>The University maintains its high academic expectations and commitment to rigor for Spring Quarter. At the same time, we are sensitive to the complicated nature of this moment and the challenges many students and faculty will continue to face in the coming weeks. Our guiding principle is to protect those impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, recognizing that we do not yet know the full scope of its impact on all members of our community. We know that some students are working hard to achieve certain GPA goals. But we also have students whose family members are ill or are facing economic difficulties and who are struggling with mental health issues and challenges associated with social isolation. In the end, we made the difficult choice to employ Pass/No Pass, because we think it provides both equity and compassion to those most impacted by this pandemic.</p>\n<p>All undergraduate students will receive Pass/No Pass grading for this upcoming Spring Quarter, with a passing grade designated as a D or higher, per our current policy. Pass/No Pass grades do not count in the GPA. In line with this change, individual schools will offer increased flexibility in using a P grade from Spring Quarter 2020 to fulfill requirements. Specific details will be available from your school. We also will extend add, drop and withdrawal deadlines for students. These extensions are reflected in the academic calendar, and grading changes will be reflected in CAESAR next week. We appreciate your ability to adapt, given our changing circumstances.</p>\n<p>Preparing for Remote Learning</p>\n<p>Northwestern has a variety of resources to help faculty and students make the transition to remote instruction. Guidance regarding hardware (e.g., computer, microphone and camera) and software (e.g. Canvas, Zoom) requirements for Spring Quarter can be found here. Should you need financial support to meet these needs, please complete this form. The University Bookstore is providing free shipping for Spring Quarter. We encourage you to order your course materials as soon as possible, as shipping and delivery times are becoming longer. More information on ordering course material is available here. Learning remotely may take some getting used to! We encourage you to review these strategies for learning effectively in a remote context.</p>\n<p>University Policies and Expectations</p>\n<p>All policies and procedures that apply to your time on-campus still apply to remote learning, including policies and procedures outlined in the Northwestern Student Handbook and the University’s expectations around academic integrity.

We know that you are handling a variety of commitments at the moment in your personal and professional lives. It is especially important at this time to take care of yourself, while finding ways to stay connected with each other and your Northwestern community.</p>\n<p>We are writing now to provide important information concerning Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>Update your current address, phone number and emergency contact information</p>\n<p>Students are required to update your current address, phone number and emergency contact information. It is essential that we have up-to-date contact information to better understand where Northwestern students have settled in the last few weeks and to enable us to assist you in an emergency. Please update your local address, emergency notification phone number and emergency contact information in CAESAR by April 10.</p>\n<p>Spring Quarter Schedule</p>\n<p>As you know, Northwestern classes will be delivered remotely through at least May 4, with an announcement no later than April 17 about whether whether we will continue remote classes beyond May 4. We understand how important this decision is to you. The University continues to monitor the situation closely, and we will update you as soon as a decision is made. Any students who are unable to return to campus to resume in-person attendance will be allowed to continue their classes remotely.</p>\n<p>Spring Grading and Deadlines</p>\n<p>The University maintains its high academic expectations and commitment to rigor for Spring Quarter. Details on approaches for spring study in the Pritzker School of Law, Kellogg School of Management and Feinberg School of Medicine can be found on their respective Coronavirus update pages.</p>\n<p>Other graduate programs will offer a new option in which students will receive Pass/No Pass grades for Spring Quarter but have the option to select quality (letter) grades. We encourage only those who must have a letter grade for external accreditation, licensure or reimbursement to opt-out of Pass/No Pass grading. Pass/No Pass grades do not count in the GPA; a Pass grade does earn a credit. Schools will follow up to advise students in programs where letter grades may be prudent, and with information about allowing Pass/No Pass grades from Spring Quarter 2020 to fulfill requirements. In addition, add, drop and withdrawal deadlines for graduate students will be extended. These extensions are reflected in the academic calendar, and grading changes will be reflected in CAESAR next week.</p>\n<p>Preparing for Remote Learning</p>\n<p>Northwestern has a variety of resources to help faculty and students make the transition to remote instruction. Guidance regarding hardware (e.g., computer, microphone and camera) and software (e.g. Canvas, Zoom) requirements for Spring Quarter can be found here. Should you need financial support to meet these needs, please complete this form. The University Bookstore is providing free shipping for Spring Quarter. If you are taking classes, we encourage you to order your course materials as soon as possible, as shipping and delivery times are becoming longer. More information on ordering course material is available here. Learning remotely may take some getting used to! We encourage you to review these strategies for learning effectively in a remote context.</p>\n<p>Preparing for Remote Teaching</p>\n<p>Northwestern’s resources for the shift to remote instruction include assistance specifically designed for graduate students serving as teaching assistants or independent instructors.

Since then, we have heard from many of you, asking for a similar message to graduate students.</p>\n<p>This is a challenging time. We know many of you are anxious about the impact of COVID-19 on the educational environment, as well as on your personal situations. We read the online petition some of you have signed, and we understand that some of you are angry.</p>\n<p>We appreciate the opportunity to provide more clarity about our decision not to include graduate students in our guidance to make Winter Quarter final course assessments optional. Graduate education is complex, and there are myriad differences among degree programs and degree requirements, which are not easily covered by a blanket policy.</p>\n<p>For example, some programs result in the licensure of graduates and thus have responsibilities to national accrediting agencies specific to the discipline. These agencies have requirements that must be met to ensure that students are able to earn their degrees and meet their career goals. Further, the form and timing of final assessments across our graduate programs vary significantly, and after careful consultation with leaders in all of the schools, we determined that instructors and degree programs have the greatest expertise to make good decisions for the benefit of our graduate students and their academic progress.</p>\n<p>Please note that we have not said that graduate students must take final exams in person. University policy is unequivocal in stating that students -- including graduate students -- are not required to attend in-person Winter Quarter exams. Faculty should make arrangements for graduate students to complete remote assignments or assign grades based on work already completed. Graduate students in degree programs administered by The Graduate School should not receive an “incomplete” in a course if they complete the remaining work by the end of Spring Break. Graduate students in other schools will follow policies specific to their schools.</p>\n<p>Our faculty colleagues across the University work in partnership with us and other institutional leaders to ensure the academic integrity of degrees. We have seen considerable evidence, even today, that they are doing so, while working with compassion and care to ensure the health of our entire community. In this difficult moment that we are navigating together, we likewise ask for your partnership in these endeavors.</p>\n<p>Sincerely yours,</p>\n<p>Jonathan Holloway</p>\n<p>Provost and Professor</p>\n<p>Kathleen Hagerty</p>\n<p>Interim Provost Designate</p>","id":"8d0ff137-82cd-536b-b245-ccde2c932f53","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-northwestern/2020-04-08-23_41_31/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Graduate Student Finals: Coronavirus/COVID-19 Updates"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://common.northwestern.edu/v8/images/northwestern-thumbnail.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Remote Instruction for Entire Spring Quarter</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Northwestern Community,</p>\n<p>Thank you for making the transition to remote instruction as we enter Spring Quarter. From all indications, the beginning has gone as well as we could have hoped.</p>\n<p>We had intended to wait until April 17 to determine whether we could return to in-class instruction for a portion of the quarter.

On these special occasions, we come together as a community to mark the achievements of our talented graduates in the presence of families and friends, faculty and alumni; to proclaim the power of learning and scholarship; to pass the torch of knowledge from one generation to another.</p>\n<p>It is with deepest regret, therefore, that I write to let you know that NYU’s 188th All-University Commencement Exercises, due to take place in Yankee Stadium on Wednesday, May 20, 2020, must be postponed to a date still to be decided. Likewise, the individual school graduation ceremonies cannot go forward as planned. Given the advice of public health officials, as well as the restrictions put in place by city and state authorities, and out of our own sense of obligation to safeguard the safety of our community, it is impossible to imagine we could or should hold such large assemblies this spring.</p>\n<p>Be assured, however, that once we are on the other side of this difficult and extraordinary time, we will find a way to hold an in-person graduation exercise and properly recognize the Class of 2020 with all the pomp and circumstance you deserve and that NYU knows how to muster.</p>\n<p>In making this decision, we have consulted with student leaders as well as the deans of our schools, and we are grateful for their guidance. In short order, the deans will also be in touch with their graduates about the plans for the school graduation ceremonies or celebrations, whether virtual this spring and/or future in-person events at a later date. And while we cannot go forward with our physical gathering in Yankee Stadium, I want you all to mark the date May 20, 2020 on your calendars, for we will be looking for special ways to make sure we stay connected and celebrate the Class of 2020 on that day and in the weeks leading up to it--and to assure you that, yes, for all eligible graduates, degrees will be conferred!</p>\n<p>To the Class of 2020: I feel keenly the disappointment you must be experiencing and I would remind you of the special bond I feel for your class. We “entered” NYU in the same year and I so looked forward to marking our four years together as you progressed from freshman to senior year. And I recognize that this news follows a string of developments and announcements, each one more unnerving than the last. Many of you and your families may have already put plans in motion to be on campus in May. I also realize that you understandably have a multitude of questions for which we do not yet have answers as we all navigate these turbulent times. But we pledge to keep you informed over these coming weeks and months as our plans evolve and we get a better sense of our options.</p>\n<p>In an academic career spanning four decades at five universities, the highlight for me of each of those 40 years -- without a doubt – has been Commencement. While we will have to delay this year’s celebration, what does not have to be postponed is our expression of pride in what you have accomplished. And when we do convene to celebrate the Class of 2020 it will come with an added dose of praise and congratulations for the tremendous resiliency you have shown in the face of great adversity.</p>\n<p>Please take care of yourselves and each other.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Andy Hamilton</p>","id":"deb9fd43-5921-5963-ae77-f275f933cfe8","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-nyu/2020-04-08-23_41_57/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Message about NYU's 2020 Commencement"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"http://www.nyu.edu/content/nyu/en/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/messages-to-the-community/suspension-of-non-essential-research/jcr:content/image.img.480.high.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Date: March 20, 2020</p>\n<p>To: NYU Faculty, Staff and Trainees Conducting Research</p>\n<p>It is with great difficulty and sincere acknowledgement of the tremendous implications for your laboratories and the pace of scientific discovery at NYU that I write to update you on COVID-19 impacts to research being conducted in University buildings and laboratories.

Vice President for Student Health</p>\n<p>The pace of change due to COVID-19 continues to be swift, and the virus continues to upend so many aspects of University life. Periodic updates on the latest developments are important.</p>\n<p>First, however, before getting into that, we want to express our hope that you, your family, your loved ones, and your friends all are safe, healthy, and well. As the numbers of COVID-19 cases steeply increases here in New York, nationally, and globally, we worry about the members of our community, and how they are coping as well with the many restrictions in place to help battle the infection. You are in our thoughts, and we very greatly respect your resiliency and your adherence to those measures that keep us all safe.</p>\n<p>Academics</p>\n<p>Teaching and Learning</p>\n<p>Although COVID-19 means that in-person classes are prohibited, we are committed to the progress of our students' education. We are now holding classes remotely at all our campuses and facilities globally. Overall, it seems to be going well, a testament to our faculty's dedication, flexibility, and ingenuity. Over 99 percent of our classes are proceeding.</p>\n<p>We are also preparing to deliver summer sessions in remote format.</p>\n<p>Pass/Fail</p>\n<p>We have extended the date by which students may elect to take a course on a pass/fail basis until May 12, and we have encouraged NYU's individual schools to show flexibility about when the pass/fail option may be used by students.</p>\n<p>Tenure Clock Extension</p>\n<p>The Provost's Office has put in place a one-year extension of the tenure clock for tenure-track faculty not currently under tenure review. There are no delays for regular faculty promotions.</p>\n<p>Research</p>\n<p>We suspended all non-essential, on-site research at Washington Square; however, grant submissions and awards remain steady, and many researchers have been able to conduct their studies remotely. While COVID-19 is a hurdle to research, in some ways it is also a spur. We have started a COVID-19 Catalyst Grant effort to prompt new faculty research, and there have been a number of faculty who redirected their efforts to work on the COVID-19 pandemic. Already there have been eight \"invention disclosures\" (the first step for potentially commercializable products) and two NSF RAPID awards for work that can quickly address COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>This week NYU began distributing pro-rated refunds to students required to vacate University residence halls and suspend their meal plans. Those refunds are being provided automatically—students do not need to take any steps to receive them. Resident Assistants (RAs) are also receiving pro-rated payments.</p>\n<p>The University is also continuing its work of closely examining various fees to determine if they warrant refunds as well. We should have more to say on that in the near future.</p>\n<p>Student Residence Halls</p>\n<p>The process of students moving out of residence halls in New York City—which just preceded the steep rise in cases in New York and the toughest restrictions—is complete.</p>\n<p>The students who remain in our housing are safe and well. We have consolidated them into a small number of residences and provided them each with a room to themselves, which should help check any spread of the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The NYS “On Pause” Executive Order, and its direction that only essential services proceed during this period, had an impact on our ability to return belongings. Accordingly, the belongings of those whose boxes were packed are being shipped, and we are in the process of reaching out to those students when shipping their belongings involves customs or other declarations. The belongings of those that were not previously packed but whose room is not needed have been left locked in the room. The belongings of those that were not previously packed and whose room is needed have been safely moved and stored in locked rooms. If you have questions, please contact housing@nyu.edu.</p>\n<p>The City and State reached out to us about the availability of our remaining residence halls to assist with the response to the coming peak of the coronavirus illness here; with so many people doing so much to battle COVID-19, the University feels a responsibility to assist where it can. In that vein, next Monday, April 6, we will start making rooms in one of our residence halls—Third North—available to front-line medical workers from our own medical center, with another—Carlyle—to be made available the following week.</p>\n<p>Commencement</p>\n<p>Sadly, if unsurprisingly, we have postponed this year's All-University Commencement, which was scheduled for May 20, to a date that is still to be determined. Individual school ceremonies are likewise postponed. We did not do this lightly: we know that graduation is a momentous day in the lives of students and their families, as well as a day of pride for the University. We have pledged to find a way to mark our graduates' accomplishments on May 20, albeit virtually, and to have an in-person ceremony that properly recognizes the Class of 2020 and their achievements at the appropriate time.</p>\n<p>Budget-related and Administrative Issues</p>\n<p>Budget and Hiring</p>\n<p>The impact of the coronavirus on the University budget has been profound. Even as we continue to pay our employees and our student workers, NYU must take steps to reduce expenditures both in the current year and in 2020-21. Among these:</p>\n<p>Faculty and administrative hiring must be curtailed. Offers that have already been extended will be honored; however, no additional offers should be made, with very few exceptions, and ongoing searches should be suspended.</p>\n<p>Other than Personal Services (OTPS) expenses should be reduced except for essential purposes, with particular attention to travel, including conference travel; meals; use of consultants; etc.</p>\n<p>School and administrative unit fiscal officers will have greater detail, andm this will be a key topic during upcoming budget discussions regularly scheduled for this time of year.</p>\n<p>Construction</p>\n<p>Last week, the definition of construction projects deemed \"essential\" under Governor's Executive Order was clarified. We are in the process of safely and properly closing down most of our construction projects—i.e., all those that don't fall into the current definition of an essential construction project—including the 181 Mercer site.</p>\n<p>Concluding Thoughts</p>\n<p>We have to acknowledge that there is a great deal of uncertainty. Therefore, as we look ahead, we have to prepare for the potentiality that this pandemic will not be resolved as soon as we wish. At this point, we are making preparations across all our campuses and locations both for the possibility of reconvening in person as well as for the prospect of having to carry on with remotely-held classes into the summer. We will continue to communicate about our plans.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, even as we conduct classes, research, and the administrative operations of the University remotely, we should bear in mind that there are personnel who are on the front lines every day. Some are our brave and skillful colleagues at NYU Langone offering care to ill New Yorkers. Others are the hundreds of colleagues who continue to come to campus daily to provide the essential services to keep the University running and take care of our community. To all of these people we offer our deep, deep gratitude and respect.</p>\n<p>And to all of those stricken by the coronavirus, or who have family members or loved ones or friends stricken by COVID-19, please know that you have our deepest sympathy and concern.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 has caused great disruption and heartache, and there is more to come, no doubt. Yet its effects will not last forever. We should not lose sight of the power of hope, nor should we give up on looking forward to that wonderful day when we can be in one another's company again.</p>\n<p>Be safe and well. Take good care of yourselves.</p>","id":"f733b228-2f60-5943-a376-0552398cc818","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-nyu/2020-04-10-14_05_50/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Summary Update on COVID-19 Developments"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Dear Ohio State Community: </p>\n<p>I write to provide you with a number of important end-of-week updates related to the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). First, however, I want to express my deep gratitude and pride for how our entire university has pulled together in true Buckeye spirit during this first week of virtual classes. </p>\n<p>Hundreds of our faculty and staff have spent countless hours preparing for this unprecedented transition. On behalf of the entire university community, thank you. While I know there have been challenges, your efforts have been nothing short of extraordinary. And thank you to our students, who have demonstrated a dedication to academics and the patience and perseverance needed in what has been a time of great uncertainty. </p>\n<p>Please continue to utilize resources available at keeplearning.osu.edu for students, keepteaching.osu.edu for faculty and keepworking.osu.edu for staff. If you are on the front lines fighting COVID-19, thank you. Your contributions are critical to ensuring the safety of our communities. Everyone else is fighting the spread of COVID-19 by staying at home, practicing social distancing and maintaining exemplary hygiene. This is critical, and is the only way we will defeat COVID-19. </p>\n<p>Following are several updates on the university’s response: </p>\n<p>Refunds for housing, dining and recreational fees\nThe university is processing refunds for students who have moved out of the residence halls. Housing and dining refunds will be issued starting Friday, April 3. In addition, we will provide a prorated refund of recreational fees to students, faculty and staff members starting on Friday, April 3. </p>\n<p>Members of our community to whom these refunds apply will receive details via a separate email shortly. </p>\n<p>Grade policy changes\nThis week, University Senate voted to approve pass/no pass grading for general education and elective courses. This measure allows individual students to opt-in for pass/no pass grading rather than letter grades. Many colleges have also extended this flexibility for required courses. A second measure approved by the senate allows students who are granted an incomplete grade to have more time — 10 weeks from the start of the next term, instead of six weeks — to complete work and receive a grade.</p>\n<p>University state of emergency\nWe continue to follow up on last week’s declaration of a state of emergency. As a reminder, this declaration enables university leaders to utilize Disaster Leave (Policy 6.28) and is essential to give us flexibility in making a variety of financial decisions over an extended period if necessary. Per the policy, we will reevaluate the declaration on a weekly basis. Facilities previously announced as closed will remain so until further notice. </p>\n<p>We will also continue to follow recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about events and gatherings. Until further notice, no university events will be scheduled until at least May 9. We will continue to evaluate events and will share plans to either end the restrictions early or, if needed, extend them. </p>\n<p>Support resources\nThe university remains committed to resources that support the mental health and wellness of our community. For students, these include: the Office of Student Life’s Counseling and Consultation Service and the Buckeye Peer Access Line (PAL), which operates Monday through Friday from 8 p.m. to midnight when classes are in session. Resources for faculty and staff are available through the Office of Human Resources’ new Keep Well website, the Health and Wellness page and Your Plan For Health. Additionally, the Ohio State: Wellness app is designed for students but offers tips and guidance useful for all members of our community.  </p>\n<p>We as Buckeyes derive great strength from bringing together outstanding individuals from across a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. Now, more than ever, it is vital for us to sustain the sense of inclusion and support that has been key to our community. </p>\n<p>In this time of constant change, I am reminded of our “Carmen Ohio” which speaks to the unity and resilience of Ohio State and our people. </p>\n<p>Thank you, and we will continue to communicate and share updates with you regularly. </p>\n<p>Sincerely,\nMichael V.

The university remains committed to the health and well-being of our community. Though there have been no confirmed cases at Ohio State, every step we take as a university is aimed at reducing any potential spread of the virus and ensuring the continuation of our academic mission. </p>\n<p>We have a large student population and global reach that require us to manage this issue while taking a variety of circumstances into consideration. </p>\n<p>Below are several steps the university is taking today following consultation with experts within our university community and continually evolving guidance from city, state and federal officials. </p>\n<p>We are suspending face-to-face classes and transitioning to virtual learning for the remainder of the semester — and will be facilitating a scheduled and orderly process for students to move out of the residence halls. To aid this process, we are extending spring break by one week through Sunday, March 22. Finally, we are sharing new reporting and quarantine restrictions related to travel. </p>\n<p>Classes </p>\n<p>• Beginning Monday, March 23, instruction will be virtual for the remainder of spring semester. Exceptions will be made for certain clinical experiences or field work in which students are actively serving patients or clients. Academic leaders from those programs will be contacting students with specific information. Further resources are available at the Ohio State Keep Learning website. </p>\n<p>University housing </p>\n<p>• All undergraduate students living in university housing — whether they remain on campus at this time or are currently traveling for spring break — will be required to return for the remainder of the semester to their permanent home residences, or a non-campus or alternative housing arrangement. This does not pertain to students living in family housing. </p>\n<p>• University housing residents who are away on spring break should not report directly back to their on-campus residences. Tomorrow morning, you will receive a message from the Office of Student Life asking you to schedule a move-out time between Saturday, March 14, and Sunday, March 22. Time slots will be strictly enforced to ensure appropriate and safe social distancing. Information will be available at go.osu.edu/2020moveout. </p>\n<p>• If you are among those students who did not leave campus for spring break and are here at this time, we will support you in your scheduled move-out process with the objective to have this process completed on Sunday, March 22. </p>\n<p>• We understand that there will be exceptions and extenuating circumstances. We will work with students who are not able to return home during this time period on an individual basis. Residence halls and some dining locations will remain open during this process. Additional communications will follow shortly from University Housing in the Office of Student Life. </p>\n<p>Extension of spring break </p>\n<p>• To facilitate these changes, we are extending spring break for one week through Sunday, March 22. Faculty and staff are encouraged to use the extended week to prepare further for virtual course work. Resources are available at the Ohio State Keep Teaching website. Returning from travel </p>\n<p>• Based on the new level 3 travel warning for Europe from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ohio State is requiring that students, faculty and staff currently traveling in one of those countries selfquarantine for 14 days upon their return to the United States. </p>\n<p>• During the 14-day self-quarantine period, you are not permitted to come to work, attend our limited non-virtual clinical or field experiences, or participate in any other campus or community activities. If extenuating circumstances prohibit any student currently living in university housing from observing self-quarantine off campus, please contact University Housing for support and guidance at housing@osu.edu. </p>\n<p>Once again, there will be additional communications as we learn more. Please check our website for all updates and additional information. You can also address your questions to coronavirus@osumc.edu. </p>\n<p>These are extraordinary times. I am gratified by the flexibility and spirit of cooperation we have experienced from our students, faculty, staff and parents.

We are being proactive in an effort to prevent illness and continue the important work of the university. I understand that our policy guidelines will cause measurable disruption, but the risk of not acting outweighs the inconvenience of these temporary measures. The safety of our campus community is always our top priority. Your cooperation and collaboration will help to ensure an appropriate response across our institution to this rapidly changing matter. Thank you for that. </p>\n<p>One of the best ways to prevent the spread of viral illness is to minimize the circumstances in which individuals may interact and transmit disease. </p>\n<p>Below are a number of updates related to classes, work arrangements, travel and campus events that will allow us to continue the education of our students while protecting our community. </p>\n<p>Guidance for faculty and students regarding classroom teaching </p>\n<p>• We are suspending face-to-face instruction in lectures, discussion sections, seminars and other similar classroom settings and moving to virtual instruction, effective immediately and through at least Monday, March 30. We are evaluating classroom experiences such as laboratory and performance classes, and the university will provide specific guidance this week. We will reevaluate these guidelines on an ongoing basis and share updates or modifications as more information becomes available. </p>\n<p>• While completing classes virtually, students may choose to return to their permanent place of residence or return to campus, where appropriate social distancing and enhanced preventative public health and hygiene measures will be actively encouraged. </p>\n<p>• We urge all students to make the choice that is best for their own personal situations. Telecommuting opportunities for faculty and staff </p>\n<p>• The university is also preparing plans for telecommuting opportunities, where appropriate, for faculty and staff during this time. Managers are expected to be flexible in allowing those employees who are able to do so to work from home. More information about telecommuting will be available from Human Resources in the coming days. The Wexner Medical Center will communicate with clinical faculty and employees regarding this option. </p>\n<p>Human Resources guidance for managers and supervisors </p>\n<p>• Information about COVID-19 reporting, employee-leave management and associated workplace issues will be available from Human Resources in the coming days. </p>\n<p>Travel </p>\n<p>• Effective immediately and until further notice, all university-sponsored international travel is suspended. This includes new travel as well as any currently booked trips between now and April 20. We will reevaluate these guidelines and share updates as more information becomes available. </p>\n<p>• The previously announced restrictions of university-sponsored travel to China, Italy, Iran and South Korea, which currently are under Level 3 warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, remain in effect through at least April 20. Personal travel to these countries should be reported to: travelreporting@osumc.edu. Additional information about how to report travel is available on the university’s coronavirus website: <a href=\"https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/features/coronavirus\">https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/features/coronavirus</a>. </p>\n<p>• University-sponsored domestic air travel will be limited to business essential travel and will be approved on an as-needed basis. A process for requesting and approval of domestic travel will be shared shortly. This includes new travel as well as any currently booked trips between now and April 20. We will reevaluate these guidelines and share updates as more information becomes available. </p>\n<p>• The university will work on an individual basis with students who are currently on university-sponsored international or domestic travel and need assistance with returning early. For international travel, contact the Office of International Affairs Risk Management at 614-292-6677. For domestic travel, email studentlife@osu.edu. </p>\n<p>• Travelers returning from Level 3 warning countries are required to observe a 14-day period of self-quarantine and monitoring. During this period, you are not permitted to come to work, attend class or participate in any other campus or community activities. The university does not have the capacity to provide self-quarantine locations on campus for students. Students needing to self-quarantine will be required to return to their permanent home residences or selfquarantine in their off-campus apartments. Students who reside in university housing and are unable to return to a home residence should contact University Housing in the Office of Student Life at housing@osu.edu. </p>\n<p>Events </p>\n<p>• No new, non-essential events will be scheduled on campus through April 20. </p>\n<p>• We encourage event organizers for scheduled non-essential events occurring on campus between now and April 20 to immediately evaluate whether these events should continue in person. </p>\n<p>• We will continue to evaluate events and will share plans prior to April 20 to either end the restrictions early or, if needed, extend them. As mentioned, the situation is evolving daily. All guidelines are subject to change as emerging events warrant. I appreciate your understanding and continued cooperation during these changing times. I also want to express my thanks to the individuals and teams who have worked many hours to implement plans that will help keep our community safe. </p>\n<p>We will continue to monitor regularly and make adjustments as needed with the well-being of our university community top of mind.

Many colleges and programs are also extending this option to required courses in undergraduate majors and graduate programs. </p>\n<p>As I mentioned last week, we are offering this flexibility because coronavirus (COVID-19) has forced such massive adjustments in all of our lives.

We will hold a graduation ceremony at a later date for members of the spring Class of 2020, their families and guests, at a time that is safe and practical. The Class of 2020 will be actively included in the scheduling and planning.   </p>\n<p>University state of emergency  </p>\n<p>As a reminder, Ohio State is in a state of emergency. This state of emergency declaration enables the university to utilize Disaster Leave (Policy 6.28) and is essential to give us flexibility in making a variety of financial decisions over an extended period if necessary. This includes our ability to provide monetary relief to employees who are able to work but unable to perform their duties in a telework setting.   </p>\n<p>Today, I am extending the state of emergency through Friday, April 10. Per the policy, we will reevaluate the declaration weekly.   </p>\n<p>Disaster leave   </p>\n<p>The Office of Human Resources offers information about leave programs available to faculty and staff during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Ohio State offers several leave options, including regular accrued time and university disaster leave. In addition, information is available on how to use the expanded leave options through the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Leave options for Wexner Medical Center faculty and staff information is available on OneSource. </p>\n<p>Budgetary contingency planning  </p>\n<p>In these troubled times, our core mission is more critical than ever. In order to protect the core mission and maintain fiscal stability, we are engaged in active budgetary contingency planning.   </p>\n<p>The ultimate duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. As responsible stewards of the resources entrusted to us, we must plan for multiple contingencies while maintaining and advancing patient care, research and teaching.   </p>\n<p>Availability of university facilities for community support   </p>\n<p>Organizations across Ohio and the nation are stepping forward to provide resources to aid in the fight against COVID-19. Ohio State has been approached by community partners about the possibility that some facilities currently not in use, such as some residence halls and other facilities, could be made available to the community for a variety of potential uses during this time. We will share information about these partnerships when arrangements are finalized. </p>\n<p>Career Roadmap implementation extension   </p>\n<p>The university remains committed to the implementation of the Career Roadmap as an initiative to standardize job classification and compensation structures to help attract and retain top talent. At this time and in alignment with extending the initial Enterprise Project implementation dates by six months, we are extending the Career Roadmap implementation dates by six months. More information is available on the Career Roadmap website. </p>\n<p>Events, buildings and teleworking   </p>\n<p>We have extended the date for cancellations of all university events to Monday, July 6. This is consistent with our approach to a virtual summer term, announced this week. Any university event scheduled between now and July 6 will be canceled, and no new university events will be scheduled until that time. We will continue to reevaluate based on evolving conditions.   </p>\n<p>Relatedly and until further notice, Ohio State has closed the following facilities: all recreational sports indoor facilities, the Ohio Union, the Younkin Success Center, libraries and university bookstores. At this time, only critical services are maintained physically on campus. As with all current restrictions, we will continue to monitor and extend restrictions, if needed, or end them early.   </p>\n<p>This is a very difficult and challenging time for the world. Many are suffering from the disease or have lost loved ones, and all of us are affected by the many changes this pandemic has brought.

We are grateful for your cooperation in these unprecedented times.</p>\n<p>Based on these orders, the EOC has taken the following actions:</p>\n<p>In accordance with stay-at-home provisions, commuter students should remain at their homes and not access University campuses while these orders are in effect. If this causes an academic challenge, contact the associate dean of commuter students, Stacy Montgomery . All University library locations are now closed until further notice. Remote library services remain available. Graduate campuses are now closed to all visitors, but remain open to faculty and staff for essential purposes. All campus bookstores are now closed. The John Tyler Drive booth entrance on the Malibu campus is now closed. All traffic on to campus will go through the Seaver Drive booth until further notice. Interim Restrictions for Campus Visitors have been updated to allow only essential invited guests on the Malibu campus using the visitor form . Interim Travel Restrictions have been extended through April 19. Any essential University travel must receive prior approval by the EOC. All in-person University events have been suspended through April 19. All faculty and staff should work remotely when possible. Faculty and staff may access campuses to facilitate remote distance learning or perform essential functions if that work cannot be accomplished remotely. Supervisors should ensure the minimum number of Critical Support Personnel are reporting to work to maintain essential University operations.</p>\n<p>Reminder on Social Distancing</p>\n<p>The orders reinforce social distancing measures, and the University is committed to honoring these important directives. All gatherings of 10 or more people are prohibited, and gatherings of less than 10 people must adhere to strict social distancing requirements.</p>\n<p>President’s Briefing via Zoom on Monday at 9 AM</p>\n<p>All faculty, staff, and students are invited to attend a special online President’s Briefing this Monday, March 23, beginning at 9 AM.

This evening, the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health issued the “Safer at Home Order for Control of COVID-19,” which takes effect at midnight tonight and runs through April 19, unless extended. The order advises all citizens to stay home to the greatest extent possible except for essential activities; prohibits all gatherings of 10 people or more; closes non-essential retail businesses; and reminds citizens to practice social distancing, remaining at least six feet from all others when outside the home. This order does not prohibit outdoor activities like hiking, shopping at essential businesses, or food pickup at restaurants. Questions about the order are addressed on the county’s FAQ website.</p>\n<p>The order does not apply to colleges and universities for purposes of facilitating distance learning or performing essential functions; however, the other portions of the order, like practicing social distancing, do apply. Critical Support Personnel should continue to report to work to perform essential functions. Supervisors should use judgment to ensure the minimum number of employees are reporting to work to sustain essential University operations.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced statewide COVID-19 mandates, which he noted are consistent with the Los Angeles County order described above.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s Emergency Operations Committee will announce additional updates to University practices tomorrow.</p>\n<p>New COVID-19 Cases at Pepperdine</p>\n<p>The University learned today of two additional confirmed positive COVID-19 test results within the Pepperdine community, including the first known COVID-19 case on the Malibu campus. The student did not live in University housing and is now in isolation. The second new case is a London program participant who recently returned home.</p>\n<p>Out of an abundance of caution, Pepperdine has notified those who may have had close contact or potential exposure with the infected individuals and asked them to quarantine for 14 days and monitor their symptoms.

One of the most important means of doing this is to ensure that the community avoids large gatherings, which COVID-19 has made unsafe.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as a result, we have decided to postpone all of this spring’s commencement ceremonies and activities. New dates for in-person ceremonies will be scheduled and announced once circumstances allow and with enough notice for graduates and their families to return to campus for the celebration.</p>\n<p>This decision was not made lightly. We know this news will be upsetting both to graduates, who have worked so hard to reach this milestone, and to their loved ones, who have supported them on their journeys. We recognize that this is not how any of you imagined this year ending—without the time to celebrate together and say farewell to the friends, mentors and the University that has fostered and witnessed your academic and personal success.</p>\n<p>Please be assured that the University is committed to celebrating our graduating students’ impressive achievements when it is safe to do so.</p>\n<p>This year’s graduates have done remarkable things, despite all the challenges faced along the way—and our graduates are primed to do even more.

Some key points on this front are:</p>\n<p>Senior Vice Chancellor for Research Rob A. Rutenbar will be issuing guidance later today to initiate a planned and orderly reduction of on-campus, research-related activities—with the aim of retaining only activities that are deemed essential. Research faculty and leaders will work with their schools, Pitt Research, or your campus president to identify these activities. Access to laboratories and other research facilities will be restricted to identified personnel who have a specific need to be on campus, supporting essential activities or associated facilities and equipment.</p>\n<p>In a separate message, we will be announcing the closure of many on-campus academic support facilities, except to specific personnel. These changes will affect access to nearly all of the remaining shared facilities, such as libraries, recreational facilities, computer labs, study areas and group spaces, that are currently available to University faculty, staff and students. At the same time, we are working to ensure that these support facilities can continue providing essential services to support our ongoing teaching and research activities.</p>\n<p>After these changes are in effect, most faculty and staff will be in a work-from-home status, and Vice Chancellor of Human Resources Dave N. DeJong will be providing additional information to support this transition. I want to emphasize that, because of the highly restricted access to our campuses, we are attempting to do as much of our work from home as possible—and all University faculty and staff will continue to be paid as usual.</p>\n<p>For faculty and staff who are identified as essential and must be on campus to support critical activities: We will continue taking all appropriate measures necessary to ensure that on-site activities can be performed safely and in a manner that is consistent with measures intended to reduce the transmission of the virus. These steps may include: minimizing staffing; staggering schedules; requiring minimum distances between individuals; disinfection; personal protective equipment; and other strategies. Supervisors will be providing detailed guidance to these employees, and I encourage affected faculty and staff to reach out to our Environmental Health and Safety team, 412-624-9505, with outstanding questions or concerns.</p>\n<p>Vice Provost and Dean of Students Kenyon Bonner will be issuing guidance later today to students who remain on campus. Students who must or have elected to stay on campus should note that these changes will severely limit the facilities and services available to them. Additionally, remaining students may need to relocate rooms or residence halls so that we can offer adequate staffing to ensure their continued safety and well-being. With this transition, we will limit residence hall access to students who have registered with Panther Central to remain on campus. These measures will enable us to ensure the safety of remaining students and help us manage the impacts of this public health crisis on our campuses.</p>\n<p>Members of our regional campuses: Your respective presidents will be issuing additional guidance that is specific to your campus communities in the coming days.</p>\n<p>I also want to emphasize the vital steps that each of us can take to protect ourselves, our families and our colleagues. These steps seem simple, but are among our most valuable tools: wash your hands; self-isolate if you have any cold or flu-like symptoms or if you’ve recently traveled in any area with community-based transmission; take extra precautions if you are in a high-risk group; and practice good social distancing.</p>\n<p>I realize that these changes are significant—and that they limit or eliminate many of the things that we associate with being a university community. However, we face an unprecedented challenge, and we have a responsibility to do everything we can—both as individuals and as an institution—to slow the spread of this pandemic. The stakes couldn’t be higher: We are fighting to prevent an overloaded health system—a system that is an integral part of our university and is a second home to many of our faculty, staff, students and alumni.</p>\n<p>Finally, I am deeply grateful to everyone for the steps that you are taking each and every day to respond to this global health emergency. I am aware of the amazing—even heroic—efforts that Pitt faculty, staff and students are engaging in to ensure that, even with these remarkable restrictions, our core mission will continue.</p>\n<p>Despite our forced separation, our community is finding new ways to connect and support each other. One significant milestone is that our classes resume in an online format on Monday. Equally important: Our vital research efforts will continue to make the breakthroughs that we are all counting on.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>Patrick Gallagher</p>","id":"0599c561-2fbe-5c17-8dc8-42ac383466ef","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-pitt/2020-04-08-23_23_16/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Additional Reductions in Pitt's Operating Status"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>As a result of Chancellor Patrick Gallagher’s directive and Governor Tom Wolf’s order to further limit campus operations and cease non-essential services, University of Pittsburgh building access will be limited to those with essential activities included in the scope of the governor’s order, including vital research and Pitt Police facilities, effective Friday, March 20, at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: building access changes beginning March 23 »</p>","id":"c1c6efa0-9bb8-5e5e-b56e-3182deee25dc","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-pitt/2020-04-08-23_23_24/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building Access Updates"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>On April 1, University Health Services announced updates to the Student Health Plan regarding referrals, coverage for COVID-19-related care, and coverage for telehealth visits.

The statewide stay-at-home order will continue until April 30. UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Damon Sims, vice president for Student Affairs, shared the following letter with Penn State students and parents following the “Stay at Home” order issued by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on March 28. To comply with public health directives, in the letter, Sims asks students to not return to Centre County or the State College area and shares updated rules from Penn State on student social gatherings.</p>\n<p>Letter from Sims:</p>\n<p>Dear Students, Parents, and Family Members—</p>\n<p>Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf has issued a stay-at-home order for those of us living and working in Centre County. The order takes effect at 8 p.m. on Saturday, March 28, and is designed to strongly reinforce the physical distancing that has been encouraged by public health experts for weeks. The Governor’s order now covers 22 counties in the Commonwealth. Many of you were already affected by his action, and others among you might anticipate the likelihood of a similar order coming your way.</p>\n<p>It becomes increasingly and critically important that all of us abide by the clear directive from public health officials to avoid unnecessary interactions with others outside our homes to the fullest extent possible. Governor Wolf’s order and similar directives in other jurisdictions specifically cite key exceptions to this general rule. But beyond those few exceptions, social or physical distancing is imperative.</p>\n<p>With that end in mind, I ask that those among you already in Centre County do all you must to abide by these restrictions. Your own safety and wellbeing, as well as the welfare of others, depend on it. I also ask that any among you who are contemplating a return to Centre County and State College reconsider that choice. Recent social media communications have suggested that many students are contemplating returning here, partly because it is viewed as a safe location. That hope is no longer realistic.</p>\n<p>All of us are in this together, and all of us should expect each of our communities to be affected by this pandemic. “Happy Valley” is no refuge, nor is State College better equipped to respond to the anticipated overwhelming burden the pandemic will impose on local health care and other providers.</p>\n<p>The return of more students to this small community would only invite precisely the social interactions we must all work intently to avoid. The virus seeks clusters of individuals who are willing to risk harm for the short-term gain of social interaction. We must not give it that chance.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, no recognized student organization at Penn State, including fraternities, may host any social gathering. Failure to honor this restriction in the interest of public health will risk loss of University recognition for the organization and disciplinary consequences for individuals involved.</p>\n<p>Please stay exactly where you are, if you can, and keep one another safe and well. You have my very best wishes and thanks, as we all work together to overcome this challenge, as Penn Staters always do.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Damon Sims</p>\n<p>Vice President for Student Affairs</p>","id":"7c6a1315-4913-5f5d-8ee8-79ebb731c9f0","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-psu/2020-04-08-23_20_52/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sims shares letter with students, parents following Wolf's 'stay at home' order"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.psu.edu/profiles/psu_profile/modules/psu_feature_article/images/newslogo_reverse.png\"></p>\n<p>UPDATE: The impacted individual lives and has self-isolated off campus in accordance with Pennsylvania Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations.</p>\n<p>HARRISBURG, Pa. – A PSUAlert has been disseminated to the Penn State Harrisburg campus community as required by the Clery Act and per Department of Education guidelines around community notification regarding a case of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The campus was notified that a person became sick during the week of March 16, and was later diagnosed with coronavirus (COVID-19).

Penn State campuses across the commonwealth already had practices in place that align with the governor’s new order.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff who can work from home should continue to do so and, in alignment with this new order, employees who perform mission-critical functions, categorized as such by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, are required to report onsite as directed. Per the guidance previously provided, limited access to laboratories will be maintained so that essential research-related activities can continue.</p>\n<p>The health, safety and well-being of all Penn Staters and surrounding local communities remain the University’s utmost priority.</p>\n<p>This order now impacts University Park and Beaver. Earlier this week the order was put in place for Abington, Brandywine, Great Valley campuses, and more recently Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Hazelton, York, Berks, New Kensington, Erie and Greater Allegheny.</p>\n<p>This new order is specific for individuals, in addition to previous orders for businesses, to “stay at home” to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. Penn State campuses previously moved to remote instruction and steps have been taken across the University to increase social distancing, with a vast majority of staff and faculty members telecommuting.</p>\n<p>Pennsylvania Education Secretary Pedro Rivera has offered the following guidance on some limited exceptions: “Under Governor Wolf’s order, personnel at our postsecondary institutions in all 67 counties who are providing life-sustaining services, including, but not limited to: administration, food preparation and distribution, housing, security, information technology, building maintenance, and operations (e.g., payroll) can continue to be deemed essential and are permitted to continue their work, provided they adhere to social distancing guidelines.”</p>\n<p>All campuses, regardless of their location, are following the governor’s orders at this time. Campus employees who have questions on the updated guidance should check with their supervisors. The University cannot predict when the current directives may change as this is a fluid situation; however, Penn State will continue to notify employees of any changes in status as appropriate.</p>\n<p>For the latest information about Penn State’s response to the coronavirus, go to <a href=\"http://www.psu.edu/virusinfo/\">http://www.psu.edu/virusinfo/</a>.</p>","id":"78af566b-72d7-55b4-b89c-b7e67bdf26d0","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-psu/2020-04-08-23_21_01/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Penn State campuses are aligned with governor’s ‘stay at home’ order"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.psu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/gss_thumbnail/public/Katz%20Green%201536%20px.jpg?itok=Q8jXpWJE\"></p>\n<p>UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. – Penn State Law in University Park will have a mandatory credit/no-credit grading system for the spring 2020 semester in order to be supportive of students during the novel coronavirus public health crisis.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, the faculty decided to move forward with a form of mandatory credit/no credit out of concern for the students most impacted by COVID-19,” said Dean Hari Osofsky. “This approach prevents students facing severe challenges from being additionally comparatively disadvantaged and from having to make hard choices about whether to opt in or out in a semester where they simply could not perform as well as usual.”</p>\n<p>The new grading policy was developed through an extensive student input process and national benchmarking of other law schools. Students participated through a Student Bar Association survey, an Information and Listening session with the dean and members of the law school’s response team, their representatives at the faculty and curriculum committee meetings, and individual emails. This mandatory credit/no credit approach is also the one most widely taken by law schools around the country.</p>\n<p>Penn State Law is providing extensive guidance to students about the spring 2020 grading policy through its memo on grading changes and FAQs.

The new, opt-in grading system is designed to mitigate the impacts to graduate students’ GPAs and academic transcripts due to unprecedented extenuating circumstances posed by the novel coronavirus public health crisis.</p>\n<p>Under the new grading system, faculty members will enter grades as usual at the end of the semester. Graduate students may choose to keep their grades as received, or request to have one or more grades converted to one of the following alternatives:</p>\n<p>P : This grade will be available if a student earns a C or better in a course. Courses graded with a P will appear as earned credits on the graduate transcript.</p>\n<p>: This grade will be available if a student earns a C or better in a course. Courses graded with a P will appear as earned credits on the graduate transcript. V : This grade will be available if a student earns a D in a course. Courses graded with a V will only count for attempted credits on the graduate transcript and will not count toward earned credits.</p>\n<p>: This grade will be available if a student earns a D in a course. Courses graded with a V will only count for attempted credits on the graduate transcript and will not count toward earned credits. Z: This grade will be available if a student earns an F in a course. Courses graded with a Z will also only count for attempted credits on the graduate transcript and will not count toward earned credits.</p>\n<p>None of the three grades, including P, will have any impact on a student’s GPA. Every student is strongly encouraged to continue striving for the highest possible grades in each class.</p>\n<p>Students should consult with their adviser and will have approximately one week following the posting of grades to request to opt-in to the alternative grading system on a course-by-course basis. There is no limit to the number of courses for which graduate students can request an alternative grade. More information about this process and key deadlines will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>Students considering opting into the alternative grading system should consider any potential impacts with their adviser, including potential consequences related to academic requirements for their course of study or professional licensure organization. The University is urging graduate programs to exercise flexibility with formal program requirements to foster students’ continued academic success.</p>\n<p>The implementation of this alternative grading scale follows a similar system implemented for undergraduate students during the spring 2020 semester, as well as a recent resolution of the Penn State Faculty Senate asking the University to explore alternative grading in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>Please consult the Optional Alternative Grading for Graduate Students and accompanying FAQ for more information.</p>","id":"6fe17e0b-182f-53ac-ab63-11adbce5cb19","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-psu/2020-04-10-14_07_13/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Graduate School implements optional alternative grading for spring 2020 semester"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.psu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/gss_thumbnail/public/PSUstock-PS%20Seal-HUB-001.jpg?itok=lUVfaVOc\"></p>\n<p>UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. – In response to the growing coronavirus pandemic, orders from the state government and recommendations from global public health organizations, Penn State will hold its spring 2020 commencement ceremony via livestream on May 9. The virtual ceremony will recognize all Penn State undergraduate students and all graduate students in the Penn State Graduate School.</p>\n<p>The University is committed to providing opportunities to invite the Class of 2020 back for in-person celebrations when public health guidelines allow.</p>\n<p>“While no one could have anticipated a virtual celebration, I want our graduates and their families to know we are excited to recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of the Class of 2020,” said Penn State President Eric J. Barron. “Despite the disappointment of not doing so in-person, we are inspired by the idea that graduates and families across the United States and internationally will be able to mark this very special occasion. We are so proud of all our graduates, and of their parents and extended families who have contributed so much to their success. This is a moment to celebrate.”</p>\n<p>During the May 9 ceremony, members of the Penn State Class of 2020 and their friends and families are invited to gather together online as the University leadership recognizes them and confers their Penn State degrees. The streamed ceremony will feature formal remarks, musical performances and sharable digital slides honoring each graduate.</p>\n<p>The College of Medicine, Dickinson Law, Penn State Law, and Penn College will manage their own celebrations and communicate directly to their graduates.</p>\n<p>“We recognize and share the interest of students to return to campus, to come together as a community to celebrate Penn State’s Class of 2020,” he said. “A defining characteristic of Penn State is our community, and we can’t wait to welcome you back to your university, to put an exclamation point on your achievements.”</p>\n<p>Nick Jones, executive vice president and provost, added that individual colleges and campuses will be hosting their own virtual celebrations for their graduates, in addition to the University-wide commencement.</p>\n<p>“We have met with student leaders, and know this is important to all our students,” said Jones. “Our chancellors and deans are working on plans and will communicate directly with graduates. We have all hands on deck to do everything we can to properly recognize and celebrate the fantastic achievements of the Class of 2020. We couldn’t be prouder of their accomplishments.”</p>\n<p>For more information about the event, visit these frequently asked questions at <a href=\"https://sites.psu.edu/virusinfo/faqs/#events\">https://sites.psu.edu/virusinfo/faqs/#events</a>.

Regardless of your current physical location, our Boilermaker Nation is a family and one that has no walls, no borders, and certainly no limits!</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, this Spring 2020 semester is like no other you have ever experienced. I can assure you that is true for all of us. It proves to be the semester that will go down in history as the most disruptive in decades and will likely be known as the ‘asterisk semester’ as it relates to academic transcripts.</p>\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated many changes in how we perform our work. Recognizing the many challenges to undergraduate students and instructors as they rapidly transition to unfamiliar modalities of instruction and assessment, we are relaxing a number of deadlines and regulations. We will be providing a one-time exception in order to create a broad safety net for students.</p>\n<p>These changes for the Spring 2020 semester are:</p>\n<p>Pass/No Pass: Students have until the end of the semester (May 1, Friday before finals) to switch any course from a letter grade to P/NP. The minimum threshold for a grade of “P” is defined as a C- for all 10000-40000 level courses in Spring 2020. Passing grades for courses completed in Spring 2020 will count for any and all degree, admissions indexes, and pre-requisite requirements internal to Purdue. As always, P/NP grades are not used in computing GPA.</p>\n<p>Withdraw/Drop: Students have until the end of the semester (May 1, Friday before finals) to withdraw from (drop) a course, with academic advisor approval.</p>\n<p>Incompletes: Any student receiving an incomplete for a Spring 2020 class will have the full 20-21 academic year, to the end of the Spring 2021 semester, to clear the incomplete, which is the existing regulation. However, we will strongly discourage faculty and instructors from issuing incompletes.</p>\n<p>Academic Dismissal: No student will be dropped from the University as a result of their performance in Spring 2020. Normal regulation will be reapplied in the fall.</p>\n<p>Academic Probation: No student will be placed on academic probation as a result of their performance in Spring 2020. Normal regulation will be reapplied in the fall.</p>\n<p>Transcript Notation: A comment will be added to the transcript of all students enrolled this semester making reference to the COVID-19 pandemic for the S20 semester.</p>\n<p>You are urged to work with your academic advisor prior to making any grade modality or drop decisions to be sure the full implications of these decisions are understood. There are many reasons that will factor in to your choice of grade modality, and many factors that may impact your ability to learn over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Please stay connected with us, with each other, and with all your networks and communities around the world as we overcome this challenge.

We are anxiously anticipating the opportunity to get you reconnected with your coursework and program of study and your instructors have been working hard while you are away to be sure you can complete your studies this spring.</p>\n<p>Recognizing that much has changed so quickly, and is remarkably different from our normal way of doing our work, we wanted to share with you how services on campus have been modified for your safety and that of the general public. We know that social distancing can help to flatten the curve, so our message remains the same, if you do not need to be on campus, please stay away from campus, stay safe and follow all social distancing protocols.</p>\n<p>To officially welcome you back from the spring break and to our new remote learning structure, please click here for a special message from President Mitch Daniels.</p>\n<p>Now, some additional information:</p>\n<p>SPRING BREAK TRAVEL REMINDER:</p>\n<p>Please remember if you traveled over spring break and you plan to return to campus, you must adhere to the following public health guidance:</p>\n<p>If you feel sick, you must stay home. Students who live on campus and feel sick should call PUSH for further instruction.</p>\n<p>If you are returning from a Level 3 travel advisory country, you must self-quarantine for a period of 14 days PRIOR to returning to campus.</p>\n<p>If you are returning from other regions, including domestic returns, you should 1) stay home if you are sick; 2) work/study remotely and, importantly, do not return to research labs for 14 days after your return; and 3) practice safe social distancing.</p>\n<p>ACCESSING YOUR COURSES:</p>\n<p>Your instructors, instructional designers, advisors, academic assistance and student life teams have been working hard to move your courses into a format that can be delivered remotely so you can continue your studies. Detailed guidance on how to access and succeed in your remote courses is available here.</p>\n<p>BUILDING ACCESS:</p>\n<p>Starting Monday, March 23, nearly all buildings and offices on campus will restrict walk-in traffic. You will still be able to contact any office you need (advising, dean of students, CAPS, etc.) by phone or email. While the campus remains open, we have had to change our method of service delivery to help reduce the spread of the virus. The buildings listed below have already closed:</p>\n<p>Bechtel Innovation Design Center (BIDC)</p>\n<p>Córdova Recreational Sports Center (CREC)</p>\n<p>Krach Leadership Center (KRCH)</p>\n<p>Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC)</p>\n<p>Beginning Wednesday, March 25, all research, academic and administrative buildings will remain locked throughout the day as the default. PUSH, Hicks Undergraduate Library (for wi-fi access), and the Welcome Center in Stewart Center will remain open. The South entrance to Stewart Center will be open to allow access only to the Welcome Center on the building’s main floor. The Welcome Center will be staffed to answer questions that are not otherwise covered on the university’s COVID-19 FAQ website or that cannot be answered by the call center (765-496-INFO (4636) or toll-free 1-833-571-1043, M-F). Please note that you will not have access to other areas in Stewart Center.</p>\n<p>CAMPUS FOOD SERVICE:</p>\n<p>Campus food options will be extremely limited. Credit cards and meal swipes (for carryout only) can be used at Wiley Dining Court, Third Street Market and at the Daily Bite food truck at Hawkins Hall. Menus will be limited.</p>\n<p>COMPUTER AND WIFI ACCESS:</p>\n<p>Students living in University Residences will have their usual wi-fi and internet access.</p>\n<p>For those students who have no other access to wi-fi or a computer, Hicks will offer limited hours (7:30 am – 6 p.m. Monday-Friday). Social distancing standards and occupancy will be monitored to ensure the health and safety of users. Unfortunately, no study groups will be permitted so we can respect social distancing and serve those most in need of this limited service. Staff will be on-hand to continuously clean throughout the day.</p>\n<p>STUDENT WORKERS:</p>\n<p>During this time of change and uncertainty, we have not forgotten the important role your employment plays in university operations. We also know that your employment plays a valuable role in your education. We appreciate you and want to let you know we understand how difficult it is to decide whether or not to return to your campus job. If you are a student who holds a campus job, please click here for more information. We urge you to also speak with your supervisor for additional guidance.</p>\n<p>RESIDENCE HALL MOVE OUT:</p>\n<p>All students in the residence halls who can move home — or to a different location — should do so by March 30, 2020. Move out information for residence halls is available here.</p>\n<p>DINING/RESIDENCE HALL MOVE OUT CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Information on financial credits for students who will be moving out of University Residences can be found in this message.</p>\n<p>LIVING ON CAMPUS:</p>\n<p>Due to concerns with the spread of the coronavirus, campus living will be dramatically different than before spring break. Students staying on campus are asked to take special precautions to maximize social distancing and do their part to help ensure the health of the campus community.</p>\n<p>Guests will be prohibited in all University Residences buildings and facilities.</p>\n<p>Dining services will have reduced hours and operate with pick-up service only. See dining.purdue.edu for specific information.</p>\n<p>Some students may be asked to relocate rooms in order to have more privacy and minimize disease spread</p>\n<p>Guidance from federal and state public health authorities may require additional actions on the part of students who remain with us.</p>\n<p>See this message for more information.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 UPDATES:</p>\n<p>The Purdue COVID-19 FAQ webpage is your best source of up-to-the-minute information. For other questions, please call the Purdue COVID-19 Information Center at 765-496-INFO (4636) or toll-free 1-833-571-1043.

As a campus community, during normal times, we have more than 50,000 people on campus daily and in close proximity to one another. These are not normal times, and we have an important duty to protect your health and that of the general public to help minimize the spread of this disease in society at large. Thank you for your continued efforts in taking these significant changes to campus life in stride, and for helping us keep our campus and our community healthy and safe.</p>\n<p>Boiler Up!

We had wanted to preserve the slim hope of a return to in-person instruction, but evolving circumstances and scientific guidance make it clear that no such resumption would be responsible.</p>\n<p>We realize the challenges of this move to remote learning and did not come to this decision lightly. The CDC has now issued guidance that “for the next 8 weeks, organizers … cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 or more people.” Institutions of higher education are currently exempt from this CDC guidance, but that could change quickly. Our students making travel plans — especially our international and non-resident students — need to know now the learning plan for the remainder of the semester. Travel guidance is changing almost daily, and travel that is possible today may not be tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Our own faculty experts in public health and virology are strongly supportive of this move. And, our faculty and staff will now be better able to plan the remainder of the semester with this decision made.</p>\n<p>Students living in our residence halls will receive detailed instructions from University Residences tomorrow (Tuesday, March 17). It is important to note that our residence halls will remain open to any student who needs housing. That said, with the remainder of the semester now to be delivered remotely and all student activities cancelled until the semester’s end, we strongly recommend that all students in the residence halls who can move home – or to a different location – do so. This does not apply to students who are living in family or graduate housing.</p>\n<p>While it seemed prudent to wait for additional information on the COVID-19 outbreak before making this decision, for all the reasons outlined above it is now time to move to remote learning and continue our semester in that fashion. Classes will reconvene remotely on March 23.</p>\n<p>To our faculty and staff, as indicated in earlier communications, our campus remains open and we will be allowing telecommuting/remote work on a temporary basis for all positions where such work is possible, whenever such work is possible, as determined by unit leaders.</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<p>We will be moving to remote instruction for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>Our residence halls will remain open for those students who must remain on campus, but any student who can move home/to a different location should do so.</p>\n<p>Our campus remains open, with telecommuting/remote work permitted wherever possible.</p>\n<p>You have our deepest thanks for all you will do to help us continue our semester – from wherever you are.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we adapt to this extraordinary and ever-changing situation.</p>\n<p>Guided by current public health and safety recommendations, our plan for summer 2020 is as follows:</p>\n<p>Courses</p>\n<p>Virtually all courses, graduate and undergraduate, that start in the months of May or June will be conducted remotely. Limited exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis for small scale experiential learning following a public health review and approval. Details on how departments can request exceptions will be shared with department heads soon.</p>\n<p>The decision on whether or not courses that start in July will be conducted face-to-face will be made no later than May 15. This includes Early Start, Summer Start and Summer College for High School programs.</p>\n<p>It is our hope that we are able to offer all courses originally planned for summer in a remote format. Academic progress for all students continues to be a priority.</p>\n<p>Instructors that need assistance with transitioning courses to remote learning should contact innovativelearningteam@purdue.edu.</p>\n<p>Students that need assistance with learning remotely can find resources here. The academic assistance programs that students depend on while on campus will continue to be available remotely.</p>\n<p>Conferences and Events</p>\n<p>All May conferences and events on campus are canceled.</p>\n<p>The decision on whether or not June conferences and events will be held will be made by April 15.</p>\n<p>The decision on whether or not July conference and events will be held will be made by May 15.</p>\n<p>Athletics will continue to follow campus, NCAA and Big Ten guidance.</p>\n<p>Summer Transition, Advising and Registration (STAR)</p>\n<p>STAR will be delivered remotely beginning May 11. Orientation Programs is creating live and recorded experiences to supplement Virtual STAR (VSTAR), a program that for many years has successfully introduced international students to Purdue University. These offerings will engage students with faculty, staff and current students and provide an introduction to campus culture, resources and advising throughout the summer.</p>\n<p>Incoming students who have accepted their offers of admission will be enrolled in VSTAR automatically. Students will work with an academic advisor virtually to pre-register for their courses. Details about that process will be included in VSTAR.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Visits and Events for Incoming Students</p>\n<p>If we find ourselves able to resume public events/gatherings in July (again, a decision will be made by May 15), we will resume Admissions and Orientation events at that time as well.</p>\n<p>Our Admissions team is actively preparing plans for what those events will look like, with the goal, as always, to give students and their families a chance to get to know Purdue and everything that makes being a Boilermaker so great.

In any case, I hope that it helps you plan and anticipate what the summer months will look like on our campus.</p>\n<p>As always, the Purdue COVID-19 site continue to be your best source for the most up-to-date information and answers to the most frequently asked questions.</p>\n<p>Thank you, once again, for everything that each of you is doing to adapt to this unprecedented situation.

These academic regulations can be found in the university catalog (University Senate Document 84-12, March 25, 1985) and are attached as a document at the end of this memo for your convenience.</p>\n<p>This spring, COVID-19 has severely disrupted our delivery model and academic processes. Our classes are no longer meeting face-to-face, the majority of our students and faculty are no longer on campus, and many students are in different time zones or have only intermittent access to computers and internet. Under these circumstances, our traditional model of finals week is not possible. Moreover, these same factors affect our administration of timed, synchronous examinations from now until finals.</p>\n<p>To accommodate the sudden shift to remote instruction and our guidance from the Innovative Learning Team on low stakes assessment as an alternative to high stakes examinations and projects, the following exceptions to our academic regulations will be in place for the rest of the Spring 2020 semester:</p>\n<p>Exams, quizzes, or other forms of assessment for any and all courses may be given during dead week. Low stakes assessment is encouraged for assessments taking place during dead week. During finals week, for courses giving a final examination, instructors are required to offer their exam on the day their exam was originally scheduled, and must have the exam open to their students for at least a 24-hour period (with the window to encompass an open time at 12:00 am EST and a close time at 11:59 pm EST). The student must take the final exam within the allotted 24-hour time window (unless they have more than two exams scheduled on one day – see below) and the final exam must be designed to be completed in 2 hours. In addition, from April 6th to May 1st, any timed examination or other timed assessment must also provide for a 24-hour period with the window to open at 12:00 am EST and close at 11:59 pm EST) to facilitate asynchronous student access and completion of the exam or assessment. In keeping with our standard practice: “No student shall be required to take more than two examinations on one day. Students scheduled for more than two final examinations on one calendar day are entitled to reschedule any examinations in excess of two. Similarly, students faced with a direct exam conflict are entitled to reschedule either examination. It is the responsibility of the student to make the necessary arrangements with the instructor for rescheduling his/her individual examination before the last week of regularly scheduled classes.” When a student does make such a request of you, please work with them to make alternative arrangements for the exam. “ Course instructors shall not penalize a student who chooses to reschedule an examination under these options” (University Senate Document 90-22, March 25, 1991). Important note for Spring 2020 finals: The limit of two examinations in one day applies only to final exams that do not extend beyond a 24-hour window. Thus, an exam left open for more than 1 day does not count against the two examinations in one day. As a reminder, our current policy does not require an examination during finals week. As written, “If no educational purpose will be served by any type of meeting during the 16th week because the educational objectives of the course have been achieved, a department may dismiss this class meeting during the 16th week.” Therefore, if you have covered the learning objectives of your course, delivering a final exam is not required.</p>\n<p>Guidance on accessibility and accommodations for students with disabilities can be found at the Teaching Remotely and the Disability Resource Center sites. Should you have any questions on how to apply accommodations in a particular student/test situation, feel free to consult with the student’s Access Consultant or send an e-mail to drc@purdue.edu.</p>\n<p>The Innovative Learning Team recommends considering alternate forms of assessment relative to standard high stakes exams – see the Teaching Remotely site or contact innovativelearningteam@purdue.edu for assistance. Please follow whatever method is most appropriate for your department or school to inform faculty of these academic regulations. Thank you for your attention to these policies – and to the well-being and academic success of our students.</p>\n<p>B. Final Examinations*</p>\n<p>(University Senate Document 84-12, March 25, 1985)</p>\n<p>In regular semesters, the final examination period shall consist of six scheduled days comprising the 16th week of the semester. The two-hour class meetings during the six days of the final examination period will be scheduled at the discretion of the Educational Policy Committee on the advice of the Office of the Registrar as, at most, 30 two-hour periods (five periods per day, including evenings). Upon request, a single course wide examination will be scheduled for any course. In the summer session, the final examination schedule shall be appropriately scaled to meet the demand. It shall be scheduled at the discretion of the Educational Policy Committee on the advice of the Office of the Registrar in, at most, 12 two-hour periods on the last three days of the session (four periods per day, excluding evenings). Each class will be scheduled for a two-hour meeting during the final examination period. Excepted are those courses classified as individual study, clinic, student teaching, industrial experience (co-op), or research and those offered for zero credit. However, any such course will be included in the schedule upon the specific request of the appropriate schedule deputy. If no educational purpose will be served by any type of meeting during the 16th week because the educational objectives of the course have been achieved, a department may dismiss this class meeting during the 16th week. Two weeks after the beginning of any regular semester and one week after the beginning of the summer session, schedule deputies shall inform the Office of the Registrar of the courses requiring course wide examinations. It will be the responsibility of the department head or, where appropriate, the school head to inform the Office of the Registrar which courses within the department or school will not need a meeting. A schedule implementing Section B will then be developed by the Office of the Registrar in consultation with the Educational Policy Committee. Guiding principles include: Minimize the number of direct student examination conflicts. Minimize the number of students who have more than two examinations on the same day. Minimize the number of students who have consecutive (back-to-back) examinations. No student shall be required to take more than two examinations on one day. The Office of the Provost shall implement a procedure to inform faculty and students of the academic regulations governing end-of-semester exams and activities each semester to coincide with the release of the final examination class schedule. Students scheduled for more than two examinations in one calendar day are entitled to reschedule any examinations in excess of two. Similarly, students faced with a direct exam conflict are entitled to reschedule either examination. It is the responsibility of the student to make the necessary arrangements before the last week of regularly scheduled classes. Course instructors shall not penalize a student who chooses to reschedule an examination under these options (University Senate Document 90-22, March 25, 1991). Regional campuses may modify these provisions to meet local differences through established procedures of the local faculty governing bodies or, lacking these, the regional campus chancellor or designee. The final examination period is intended for the end-of-semester examination. No examination or quiz may be given during the week (three days in summer session) preceding the final examination period of the semester (examinations for laboratory, intensive, or minicourses excluded). It will be the responsibility of the department head or, where appropriate, the school head to ensure that none of the departmental or school faculty use the week (three days in summer session) preceding the final examination period to administer an examination. Comprehensive final examinations (examinations for laboratory, intensive or minicourses excluded) are prohibited except during the regular final examination periods of the last week of the semester.</p>\n<p>*<a href=\"http://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=10&#x26;navoid=12717#final-examinations\">http://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=10&#x26;navoid=12717#final-examinations</a></p>","id":"5cd74578-a613-55d4-a10c-13602278fed7","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-purdue/2020-04-10-14_07_37/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Academic Regulations Governing “End-of-Semester” Examinations"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://coronavirus.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs3591/files/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Monday, March 30, 2020 - 2:31pm</p>\n<p>Dear Rice Students and Families –</p>\n<p>As you know, last week we restarted classes in a fully remote format, a first in the history of our university. Our campus has changed in other ways. Many buildings where students, faculty and staff would congregate (including Fondren Library and the Gibbs Recreation Center) are closed, faculty have greatly reduced their research activities in labs and other campus spaces, and the vast majority of our faculty and staff are working from home. This all reflects our common goal of preventing the spread of coronavirus within our community, and we hope that all of you are staying safe and taking steps to protect yourselves and your loved ones at this time.</p>\n<p>We know that many of you are wondering about when our campus will resume normal operations and activities, and we very much wish we could answer this question. We are continually monitoring the COVID-19 situation in Houston, the United States and across the globe, and now that remote learning arrangements for the remainder of spring semester classes are settled, we are turning our attention more fully toward commencement, which is why we are writing today.</p>\n<p>We announced earlier that we would decide by early or mid-April whether to postpone the scheduled commencement in May. Based on all available information, including the announcement yesterday that national social distancing guidelines would be extended to at least the end of April, we now do not believe there is a reasonable prospect of holding commencement on the original date in May. We are therefore announcing postponement now to avoid unnecessary stress around making plans (and to provide families plenty of time to cancel any travel arrangements). We know that this will be deeply disappointing to our graduating students and their families, who have worked for and anticipated the formal graduation ceremony for years. We want to emphasize in accordance with our earlier communications that we are not cancelling commencement, but rather are postponing our normal on campus ceremony until a later date.</p>\n<p>As soon as this public health crisis has passed, we will announce and begin preparing for an on campus ceremony in our central quad to celebrate our Spring 2020 graduates. We do not know when that will be, but we will provide ample notice. In the meantime, we are forming a committee to design and launch an online commencement ceremony for all who will complete their degree requirements at the end of this semester. The online ceremony will be held on Saturday, May 16, and we will share details of this event in the weeks ahead. The names of all graduating students will be read online, but all students are also welcome to attend the on campus ceremony when that occurs.</p>\n<p>It is our sincere hope that we can gather together in a remote format and in the spirit of celebration to cheer on our graduates with their family and friends. And we very much hope that later we will see you on campus to celebrate in person.</p>\n<p>Wishing our best to you and your family,</p>\n<p>David Leebron, President of Rice University</p>\n<p>Seiichi Matsuda, Interim Provost and Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies\\</p>\n<p>Bridget Gorman, Dean of Undergraduates</p>","id":"c5130023-97b0-5218-b1df-a5724391b4ca","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-rice/2020-04-08-23_43_58/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update on Spring 2020 Commencement"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://coronavirus.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs3591/files/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Thursday, March 19, 2020 - 3:16pm</p>\n<p>As the international health crisis has required us all to adapt quickly to new conditions for working and learning, we want to offer you some guidance for online classes and meetings.

Students, faculty, and staff have had substantial demands on their time and attention. We need everyone in the community to become secure about both their hardware and their familiarity with software in order to fully ramp up to the new course delivery options that are being instituted.</p>\n<p>Rice is consequently requiring that no work can be due on March 23, 24, 25, and 26. Only work that was to be due the week of March 9 can be due on March 27. Other assignments and new assignments cannot be due before March 30.</p>\n<p>I and the Senate Executive Committee encourage you to carefully consider what material to cover in courses. It’s reasonable to develop an entirely new syllabus for the remaining time in your class. Please keep the constraints of both time and delivery method in mind, and establish pragmatic expectations for both yourself and your students. The focus should be on achieving the course learning outcomes instead of necessarily covering all the original planned content. Please don’t put an undue burden on students to make up all the material that might have been missed due to the cancellation of courses the week before Spring Break. That’s not the world in which we now live.</p>\n<p>Our Faculty Senate will vote on Wednesday on a proposal to make all classes taken by undergraduate students eligible as P/F. Faculty and instructors would continue to submit letter grades for the courses as normal, and the undergraduate student would have until the Last Day of Class to elect the P/F option. This option would only apply to letter-grade courses (not S/U). I support this proposal, and I encourage you to convey your thoughts to your senator.</p>\n<p>Note that the grading of classes taken by graduate students will not change The graduate students have generally not had housing disruptions, and they are generally not taking classes far from their disciplinary expertise.</p>\n<p>I’m sorry about this adjustment and I hope that it does not complicate your plans in an unmanageable way.

Please read it.</p>\n<p>For some graduate researchers, the constraints in the research memo will not change your studies, for example if you were already working remotely. For others, it may be a significant change of plans. However, it need not be a loss of time. Most of us have a lot of literature research to do, and it’s never too early to start writing your dissertation/thesis. Even if your research isn’t at a stage at which you can describe your findings, it’s productive to draft an introduction to what you intend to do. I didn’t do a systematic study of the literature in my research area until writing my thesis in the last few months of grad school. Too late in my graduate career to be useful, I found studies that proved that one of my projects I couldn’t get to work was never going to work. During that literature work, I also found some very promising directions that I’d already run out of time to pursue. If I’d done serious literature work earlier, I’d have written a better thesis in a shorter time.</p>\n<p>Most of us are behind on tasks and projects that are important but not urgent and that can be done from home.

Please share strategies that are working for you with us and with your colleagues in your graduate program or in similar situations. Some groups might self-organize journal clubs, writing groups, virtual lab meetings, or even virtual lunches. As you develop approaches to intellectually engage from a distance, please share these with your peers and us. GPS and GSA will work together to disseminate these strategies via social media.</p>\n<p>During these restrictions, students who are on stipend and in good standing should be paid as usual.

You can expect a receipt once the form has been processed in its entirety.</p>\n<p>We, like many other offices on campus will continue to develop new platforms to facilitate this new mode of interacting with graduate students.</p>\n<p>Please keep in touch with your fellow scholars and friends. This is a time to take some physical distance, but not to disconnect from people. Please respond in a timely manner if someone does reach out to you; people will worry! Please alert your grad program or GPS if someone is not responding to communications. To that end, I do ask that each of you update your address information in <a href=\"http://esther.rice.edu\">http://esther.rice.edu</a> so that we can effectively follow up as needed.</p>\n<p>Rice Student Health Services, the Wellbeing and Counseling Center, and SAFE office services continue to be available to students. They are taking appointments, but the process has been modified to follow CDC recommendations. Please see information on the best way to contact them and other after hours resources here. We encourage you to reach out to the Wellbeing and Counseling Center if you’d like to talk to someone.</p>\n<p>Additionally, to minimize your time on campus, effective immediately through April 30th graduate students holding a Night Owl parking pass will be allowed to park in the following additional lots: BRC Garage; North Lot; the North Annex Lot; and the Entrance 3 Garage. This is in addition to the Greenbriar Lot. Please don’t take this as encouragement to come to campus-- we’re simply trying to make things a little easier for everyone.</p>\n<p>Our office will continue to send out regular communications that will keep you updated on evolving campus changes, as well as scholastic and funding opportunities. I’m sure you have more questions. The university has continued to update resources found at <a href=\"http:///emergency.rice.edu\">http:///emergency.rice.edu</a>, including a FAQ. We will also continue to develop our graduate-specific FAQs on our website. And of course, please feel free to reach out to anyone at GPS.</p>\n<p>Let’s take care of ourselves and one another. It’s a privilege to work with you.</p>\n<p>With my very best regards,</p>\n<p>Interim Provost</p>\n<p>Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies</p>\n<p>P.S. I’ve learned a lot during the past few weeks. It turns out that there is an established, systematic method to wash hands.

We are also not permitting student participation in third-party provider study abroad programs. Questions about the cancellation of summer session undergraduate international travel experiences should be directed to the dean of undergraduates (ugdean@rice.edu).</p>\n<p>For graduate students, faculty and staff, restrictions on university-sponsored international travel will remain in place at least through the end of May, and probably beyond that date. We will provide updates as the situation progresses.</p>\n<p>We very much understand that this situation is interrupting plans that have been in the works for some time. The reality is that programs and conferences that we would have attended this summer are being canceled. Many who host international travelers aren’t in a position to do that now. At the moment, travel is risky for both travelers and hosts. The world will still be there to explore once the pandemic has passed, and our responsibility now is to not contribute to the spread of the disease.</p>\n<p>Please stay safe,</p>\n<p>Bridget Gorman, Dean of Undergraduates</p>\n<p>Seiichi Matsuda, Interim Provost and Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies</p>","id":"844b45ba-db88-5998-b224-7baf01c98648","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-rice/2020-04-10-14_06_44/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Student and faculty international summer travel"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.rochester.edu/coronavirus-update/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-covid19-updates-and-resources-3-1200x630.png\"></p>\n<p>Updated April 7, 2020</p>\n<p>The University of Rochester’s response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation is evolving.

Under this policy, all courses transitioned to the satisfactory/fail (S/F) grading option as of March 23, with students allowed to select a letter grade (A-E) option for any/all of their courses through submitting a formal request. The Dean’s Office continues to believe that this is the best approach to assist students and instructors in navigating the transition to online courses and the broader situation with COVID-19.</p>\n<p>It is with this intent that the Dean’s Office has made the decision to extend the deadline for students to select the letter grade option to April 10. This decision is in response to the concerns expressed by some students, faculty and staff that students would need some additional time to adjust to the online version of courses. The Dean’s Office will continue to monitor how students and instructors are adapting to their new circumstances moving forward.</p>\n<p>In addition, as Deans of the College and of Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs, we can’t emphasize enough the importance of instructors and students pulling together to achieve the original learning outcomes of the courses to the greatest degree possible. The response to the COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted the semester and we know that the new S/F policy may create some additional challenges. However, we firmly believe in the dedication of our instructors and the resiliency of our students. We strongly encourage all instructors to design exams, papers and other assessments in ways consonant with the current online learning environment and that ensure student learning regardless of the grading basis (S/F, letter grade) of the student. On their side, students should commit to achieving course goals to the highest degree possible in their current environment and actively reach out for assistance from instructors, advisors and other support staff when necessary.</p>\n<p>Finally, we want to clarify a few important points regarding the new policy. The Dean’s Office will soon post a FAQ to answer some common questions on the S/F for Spring 2020, but these points bear special note.</p>\n<p>The S/F policy for Spring 2020 applies to all courses taken by undergraduates in the College, including all graduate courses in AS&#x26;E, the School of Medicine and Dentistry, and other schools.</p>\n<p>The webform to select the letter grade option for courses in Spring 2020 will be released later this week. Links to the form will be placed on the Advising Handbook (<a href=\"http://www.rochester.edu/college/CCAS/handbook/index.html\">http://www.rochester.edu/college/CCAS/handbook/index.html</a>) and Registrar’s Office sites (<a href=\"http://www.rochester.edu/registrar/\">http://www.rochester.edu/registrar/</a>), among other modes of distribution.</p>\n<p>Faculty will receive a list of students selecting the letter grade option during the week of April 13.</p>\n<p>Faculty will submit “satisfactory” or “fail” grades directly into Instructor Access. (This is different from how the policy has worked in past semester.) The grade submitted for “satisfactory” will be “P” and the grade for “fail” will be “F” in Spring 2020. These are the grades that will appear on student transcripts as well. More information on final course grades will be forthcoming later in the semester.</p>\n<p>As always, we appreciate your dedication and willingness to adapt to the evolving situation with COVID-19. We continue to feel confident that we can ensure the success of our students and the achievement of our educational goals in these challenging times. The AS&#x26;E Dean’s Office will continue to support these efforts as we move forward with the semester.</p>\n<p>Jeff Runner</p>\n<p>Dean of the College</p>\n<p>Nick Vamivakas</p>\n<p>Dean of Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs</p>","id":"61f9a6ba-7641-5fe0-87e9-d71c3902d5b3","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-rochester/2020-04-08-23_26_44/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update on S/F Policy for Spring 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.rochester.edu/coronavirus-update/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-covid19-updates-and-resources-3-1200x630.png\"></p>\n<p>On Monday, faculty members and students together will begin online teaching and learning experiences to complete spring semester coursework. Many will do so for the first time. For both groups, transitioning a traditional classroom experience into an online environment presents challenges, but conquering this task in the midst of a pandemic comes with many additional obstacles.</p>\n<p>To instructors and students for Monday, just remember: we’ll figure this out together, please be patient with the process, and there’s a lot of support available.</p>\n<p>Of particular note, no one yet knows how popular technologies such as Zoom will operate when they are needed most, and internet connections from all over the world will be tested during this process. As an additional measure of preparedness for Monday, students can test Zoom on their computer in advance at <a href=\"https://zoom.us/test\">https://zoom.us/test</a>.</p>\n<p>If things don’t go as smoothly as expected with the first online experience, or technology fails, one recommendation for instructors is to pre-record lectures when possible to make them available to students on Blackboard for later viewing. This reduces the demand on technology to seamlessly deliver real-time instruction. See the tutorial and handout How do I Pre-Record Lectures for my Students?</p>\n<p>The University’s Teaching During Times of Disruption guidance has numerous short video tutorials available to instructors, covering topics such as communicating online with your students; managing a live class session; and providing accommodations to students.</p>\n<p>The complementary site, Learning During Times of Disruption, similarly has multiple resources for students, covering areas such as communicating online with instructors; participating in live lectures; and dealing with technical issues during a live Zoom session.</p>\n<p>Both sites also have contacts listed for faculty and students to seek support and troubleshoot problems throughout the semester.</p>\n<p>We appreciate that our faculty and students have been preparing for weeks for the move to online classes. We hope this transition will be as smooth as possible for everyone, but we recognize that it will not be flawless. Again, we thank everyone for their willingness to adapt to this necessary transition.</p>","id":"26da9b45-2fda-5f41-99b9-d0c0e99b8dc7","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-rochester/2020-04-08-23_26_51/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Message from Provost Rob Clark and the University School Deans on Online Instruction Beginning Monday"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.rochester.edu/coronavirus-update/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-covid19-updates-and-resources-3-1200x630.png\"></p>\n<p>From Melissa Sturge-Apple, Vice Provost and University Dean of Graduate Education:</p>\n<p>COVID-19 has had a significant impact upon the educational system across the United States and across the world.

Unfortunately, because of the current public health crisis, I am unable to hold our traditional Spring Town Meeting. I must commend, however, everyone in the Rensselaer family — our students, our faculty, our Cabinet and staff, our trustees, our alumni and alumnae, and our friends — for enabling Rensselaer to accomplish its essential missions during a time of global crisis.</p>\n<p>The historians among us tell us that daily life in the United States has not been so disrupted since the nation entered World War II, almost 80 years ago. Nonetheless, thanks to all of your efforts, Rensselaer continues to teach the next generation of scientific and technological leaders. We continue to conduct research to address the greatest challenges of humanity, including those posed by infectious diseases. We continue to keep our operations running, albeit largely remotely.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we have made the difficult decisions required to keep our community safe, and we made them with alacrity. Several Rensselaer-specific qualities have helped us during this time. We have benefited from excellent planning for a variety of scenarios — including specifically for respiratory-track viruses — with business continuity plans developed for all portfolios. Throughout the stresses of the past month, we have seen a great deal of the resourcefulness and ingenuity that have characterized Rensselaer since its founding.</p>\n<p>I must praise our remarkable faculty, who have been able to pivot with great speed to completely remote instruction. Our entire curriculum, undergraduate and graduate programs, is now being offered remotely. I especially congratulate our faculty faced with the challenge of teaching lab courses remotely — and succeeding using demonstrations and simulations. Given the current level of experimentation surrounding the challenge of delivering a Rensselaer-quality education in this environment, our faculty are developing innovations in teaching that will enhance our already innovative pedagogy.</p>\n<p>This is a moment at which our students’ intellectual agility, amid shifting circumstances, is much appreciated. I must especially congratulate both our juniors and their employers and advisers, who have made the Arch away experience this semester a true learning experience, despite the need for social distancing.</p>\n<p>For our rising juniors, we are planning actively for the Arch summer session, which will be delivered remotely. Outreach efforts for Arch away opportunities in the fall or spring continue apace, through outreach to alumni and alumnae, faculty, staff, and parents, as well as to a growing list of leading employers, in order to create, when public health allows, internships and co-ops.</p>\n<p>For all of our students and their families, the agility required at this moment is not merely intellectual, but also emotional. Our soon-to-be graduates have been forced to say goodbyes to dear friends and mentors, much sooner than they expected. We share your disappointment in our inability to conduct our traditional Commencement exercises on campus, but we will convey our deep appreciation and admiration for all you have accomplished in an online ceremony on Saturday, May 23. As soon as public health permits, we will gather in person to celebrate you, and to thank you for the sacrifices you have made, for our collective well-being.</p>\n<p>For both our faculty and our students, the sacrifices being made to slow the course of coronavirus infection include the closing of our on-campus laboratories. Given the Institute’s strength in all things digital, many of our faculty and graduate students have been able to continue their research remotely. For those with wet laboratories, we have ensured that there is essential staff to preserve samples, to care for laboratory animals, and to protect the ability to continue research.</p>\n<p>We also have joined forces with IBM, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, MIT, Department of Energy National Laboratories, NASA and the NSF, and others, to create the COVID-19 High-Performance Computing Consortium and to offer our research infrastructure to help in vanquishing this virus. Through the consortium, researchers around the globe will be able to employ our new supercomputer AiMOS — short for Artificial Intelligence Multiprocessing Optimized System.</p>\n<p>With AiMOS, researchers can explore the interconnectedness of biological systems and epidemiological data, as society works to protect our courageous health care workers and those most vulnerable to severe forms of COVID-19. With AiMOS, researchers will develop the most effective interventions possible, both therapeutic and social, and will address gaps in our knowledge. We will come out the other side strengthened in our preparedness for the next global scourge, and to restart our economy. In his White House press briefing on March 22, President Trump thanked Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and its partners for the “tremendous help” we are offering.</p>\n<p>We also are making available the expertise of our faculty in critical areas, including data science, artificial intelligence, networking, therapeutic interventions, advanced materials, and public health, as we all join forces to address COVID-19. We have a particular focus on epidemiological data analytics, interventional therapeutics, and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE).</p>\n<p>Like all universities, Rensselaer has the good fortune of being refreshed every year by wonderful incoming students. We always make a point of greeting our accepted students very warmly, and I delight in the opportunity to introduce Rensselaer to them personally. Unfortunately, we cannot do that this spring. Tomorrow, April 4, we have set up webinars for potential members of our freshman class with all of our schools, to ensure that, even in a time of social distancing, we are able to convey what an extraordinary place Rensselaer is. I look forward to greeting the newest members of the Rensselaer community in late August, and hope that it may be in person.</p>\n<p>I am very much looking forward to seeing all of you again in person, the members of the Rensselaer family, all of whom excel at collaboration, connection, and friendship. It is a privilege to steward Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute alongside you. We have faced many crises throughout our nearly 200-year history. In every case, the Institute has emerged stronger. We will do no less in this instance.</p>\n<p>I thank all of you, and each of you, for your efforts. Please stay safe, and keep your loved ones safe. We will come through this together as One Rensselaer.</p>","id":"dca9dcd3-8d4f-5e86-8034-47380be661a7","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-rpi/2020-04-10-14_00_27/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 (Coronavirus)"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://coronavirus.rutgers.edu/apple-touch-icon.png\"></p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Rutgers Community:</p>\n<p>I am happy to announce that the 2020 Rutgers University summer session will proceed as scheduled.

These are important steps and the University is as well prepared as possible to follow the State’s guidance.</p>\n<p>The Executive Order, which the Governor refers to as the “Stay at Home Order,” has both direct and indirect impacts on Rutgers. Among the direct ways that it has an impact on Rutgers, the Executive Order:</p>\n<p>Specifically permits travel to work and for educational purposes. Instructors intending to utilize classroom settings to broadcast their remote teaching may still travel to campus to do so.</p>\n<p>Closes all physical libraries and computer labs at public and private colleges and universities. It has no effect on online library services.</p>\n<p>Encourages telecommuting to the extent possible but specially identifies research lab workers as employees who may not be reasonably expected to telecommute because their physical presence may be required.</p>\n<p>Specifically exempts healthcare and medical service providers from the restrictions contained in the Executive Order.</p>\n<p>In addition, and more broadly, the Executive Order:</p>\n<p>Bans all gatherings – weddings, parties, celebrations, etc. are cancelled.</p>\n<p>Orders the closure of all retail establishments except those providing essential goods or services including food stores, gas stations, auto repair shops, and pharmacies, among other exceptions.</p>\n<p>Continues the ban on restaurants and bars except for takeout and delivery orders.</p>\n<p>Continues the ban on entertainment facilities, gyms, and other recreational facilities.</p>\n<p>While these are important steps for the State, they largely reflect much of what Rutgers has already done in response to the COVID-19 crisis. We do not anticipate that the “Stay at Home Order” will interfere with our ability to offer remote instruction beginning Monday. Every academic department has certified to their deans and their chancellors that their faculty have developed plans for remote teaching.</p>\n<p>I reiterate the University’s strongest encouragement that you work from home wherever possible.</p>\n<p>This is a time of deep personal concern and uncertainty for people across our community. To our faculty and staff, I say thank you for your incredible work over the last week to prepare the University for remote instruction and telecommuting, and for keeping our critical services up and running. To our students, I thank you for your flexibility, your patience, and your perseverance through these difficult times. I encourage you to take care of yourself and your loved ones, to be safe, and to stay home.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Robert Barchi</p>","id":"7a7348a2-7ea0-5611-bd0f-ba92f13ceb33","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-rutgers/2020-04-08-23_29_13/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update Regarding Governor Murphy's \"Stay at Home\" Executive Order"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://coronavirus.rutgers.edu/apple-touch-icon.png\"></p>\n<p>Rutgers is taking several measures to offer students academic support during these challenging times.</p>\n<p>Students will be provided additional time to withdraw from courses.</p>\n<p>Students also will have until May 22, 2020, to choose a Pass/No-credit grading option for individual courses.

As previously communicated, USD will make considerations to credit room and board charges, parking permits, and the Student Life Pavilion Fee. As determined by the Associated Students Government, the Undergraduate Associated Student Fee will be retained to provide support to students with financial needs that are impacted by this transition. The university is actively monitoring communication from the Department of Education and will finalize the proration of charges in accordance with issued guidance, once available, to minimize the impact on our students and families. The university’s goal is to ensure that instruction and academic student support continues throughout the semester. If students and families make the decision it is necessary to withdraw from the university, USD has extended the 60% Tuition Refund period from March 11, 2020 to March 20, 2020. If a student withdraws from the university after March 20, 2020, a tuition refund will not be issued. The university intends to prorate room and board charges, parking permits and the Student Life Pavilion Fee using March 13, 2020 as a point-in-time for the calculation; under these assumptions for students on the undergraduate academic calendar, the Spring 2020 Semester is 40% complete based on the total number of class days. USD will pro-rate charges at a 60% credit, rounding to the nearest whole dollar. Students on alternative calendars will receive individualized information about the proration of their charges. One exception will be Dining Dollars; Dining Dollars will be credited based on the actual balance remaining as of the last day used, or March 22, 2020. For any resident student who has been approved to remain on campus, all existing charges will remain in effect. We will continue to keep you informed as information and guidance becomes available.

Financial Accommodations Credit for room and board charges, parking permit fees, and mandatory student fees The Finance Office will arrange pro-rated reimbursement credits of room and board and parking charges; all other fees are being evaluated with the input from Associated Students. We will send information as soon as possible about the process through which these credits will be handled. Student employment We are considering accommodations for students who hold spring semester campus jobs and who had expected to continue receiving wages from their employment. Please bear with us as we assess how to address this situation. Emergency funds If the requirement for you to leave campus creates a financial hardship, you can apply to the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, which is able to provide limited assistance to high financial need students who are suffering severe hardships. International students International students who meet the criteria for remaining on campus will not have to return home. If you are an international student, you will receive a separate communication from the USD International Center addressing travel concerns and other important information. General inquiries can be sent to internationaloffice@sandiego.edu. Life on Campus for Those Students Remaining on Campus Dining All students who remain on campus and have a required meal plan will continue to be served in Pavilion Dining, or another dining unit. The hours of operations as of now remain the same. For your protection all buffet food services (self-serve) have been discontinued and are being replaced with to go options. To promote social distancing, meals will be available to take back to your room or you may eat on site. All food options are available for purchase (cash and credit card) if you do not have a meal plan. For current dining hours please visit: www.sandiego.edu/auxiliary Events No final decisions have been made at this time regarding Commencement. Given the uncertain nature of this health crisis, we believe it is premature to cancel Commencement based on the information currently available. The decision to hold or cancel Commencement will be made based on the best public health advice possible, and once made, we will inform the community. Hours of operation Student Health Center, campus libraries, and the University Center/Student Life Pavilion will be open with revised schedules and social distancing protocols in place. Information about extended or reduced hours for these and other facilities will be available next week.

Over the past few weeks, we have been sharing with you how the university was monitoring the Coronavirus outbreak while following our university protocols to mitigate any risks to our campus community. This new designation of COVID-19 as a pandemic requires the university to take even more dramatic steps to scale up our emergency response. While our primary focus remains the health and safety of our campus community and their families, it is abundantly clear that additional actions are necessary as we also wish to reduce the impact on health care systems and allow them to focus on the most vulnerable members of the community. In light of these considerations, the university is mandating campus-wide remote teaching effective March 23, 2020, through the end of the spring semester. In addition, all USD intercollegiate athletic events and club sports are cancelled for the remainder of their respective seasons. We recognize that this unprecedented situation has caused anxiety for our campus and people will need time to make the transition to the remote delivery of our classes. To help us prepare for this new experience, we are cancelling all classes from March 14-22 to enable our faculty and students to prepare for remote teaching and learning. Please know that we are continuing campus operations. We know that living in close proximity to others during a pandemic increases the possibility of transmission of a virus. Therefore, all USD students who live in the residence halls must relocate from campus no later than March 22. Since this transition extends to the end of the semester, students must take all personal items with them so that they can be fully engaged and ready for the academic remote learning experience. We understand there are some students who may have personal hardship, financial hardship or academic reasons to stay on campus, so we are preparing for a limited number of students to remain on campus for the foreseeable future. Those who want to apply to stay on campus or have a hardship in moving all items home, please complete this form. During this transition time, dining options will be provided to our students. The University of San Diego takes great pride in the high-impact learning practices that are the hallmark of a USD experience. While it remains our firm belief that high-impact practices are best delivered in person on our campus, we believe our remarkable faculty and students are capable of rising to the challenge of creating common intellectual experiences through the remote delivery of our curriculum. During these extraordinary times, we need to work together to live out our values, be gracious and patient in our actions toward each other, and rise to the challenges we will face in the weeks and months ahead. As a community, we keep all those impacted by this health emergency in our prayers, especially our students who will be traveling home in the near future.

Students who are considering a pass/no pass option should note that a pass/no pass grade is not factored into a student’s grade point average.

Finally, it is important to note that some external organizations (external funders, graduate and professional schools) have specific letter grade requirements. </p>\n<p>P/NP grading may also have implications for international students, NCAA athletes, students with ROTC or GI Bill scholarships, and some privately funded scholarship students; therefore, we encourage students to consult with relevant offices (e.g. ISS, Athletics, ROTC, and Veterans Administration) before opting to switch from letter grades to P/NP. </p>\n<p>Undergraduates who are considering the pass/no pass option and have questions should consult with the course instructor, the Drahmann Academic Advising Center, or the Office of the Registrar. </p>\n<p><strong>Requests for the pass/no pass grading option can be made at the</strong> <a href=\"https://www.scu.edu/registrar/forms/request-for-passno-pass/\">Office of the Registrar website.</a> </p>\n<p>We are grateful to the faculty, staff, and student voices who provided input.

These past few weeks have been tumultuous and very busy as we assisted students in move-out and continue to manage the ongoing transition to remote learning. We truly appreciate everyone coming together as our community does its part to stop the spread of the virus and comply with the California shelter-in-place restrictions. Please read below for our weekly roundup of updates in various areas:</p>\n<p><strong>Clarification on Start of the Term:</strong> The spring quarter start and end dates have not changed: The quarter will run March 30–June 5 with the final exam period June 8–June 11.

Thank you, again, for your continued patience as we work through your questions and concerns. In reviewing how to move forward with refunds, it was important to those involved that students have a seat at the table. I’m grateful to tell you that is exactly what we did, and that – as always – student voices were insightful and heard.</p>\n<p>Housing &#x26; dining refunds</p>\n<p>The following applies to those students who would typically live on campus, but who have since moved out for the remainder of the semester:</p>\n<p>Students will receive a 50% refund for both their housing and dining charges for the spring term.</p>\n<p>charges for the spring term. Housing scholarship awards will be reduced by 50%.</p>\n<p>Between now and March 30, we will work to understand the status of each student (whether they still live off campus or not), with the goal of processing refunds by April 8 .</p>\n<p>. At the request of our student leaders, and some of our Billiken parents, we are providing an opportunity to contribute to those most in need. That’s what Billikens do – take care of each other. Thus, students can donate a portion – or all – of their refunds to a designated fund, such as Billiken Bounty, the Student Emergency Relief Fund (for students experiencing unexpected financial needs during this pandemic), or toward SLU’s “Helping Our Own Fund” (emergency funding for SLU faculty and staff). Please email giving@slu.edu and we will set you up with the appropriate person to field your request.</p>\n<p>Students can also defer their refund to the next year on a case-by-case basis. To do this, please email sfs@slu.edu.</p>\n<p>Those students who have commuted to SLU and relied on campus dining will receive a refund of any remaining balance left on their dining cards.</p>\n<p>Parking refunds</p>\n<p>Students: All students with current parking permits will receive a refund for 50% of the semester parking expense. For those students who continue living on campus, or those visiting campus, the gates to all University-owned parking lots and garages will be open to accommodate free parking at least through April.</p>\n<p>Employees: The University will suspend collection of parking fees from employees for the month of April which will be reflected in your April pay periods. Effective immediately, the gates to all University-owned parking lots and garages will be open at least through April.</p>\n<p>For any questions, contact the parking office at parking@slu.edu or 314-977-2957.</p>\n<p>Student workers</p>\n<p>Students are an essential part of our workforce. As much as we rely on them, we know many student workers rely on the money they earn working on campus.</p>\n<p>SLU is committed to compensating employees who can’t continue working on campus during this difficult time. This commitment extends to our student workers.</p>\n<p>Per Federal Student Aid guidelines , Federal Work Study (FWS) students who are not able to keep working will continue to be paid for the hours they were expected to work through the remainder of the term.</p>\n<p>who are not able to keep working will continue to be paid for the hours they were expected to work through the remainder of the term.

More information is forthcoming.</p>\n<p>Financial hardship resources</p>\n<p>As I noted in my March 18 update, we recognize that the current public health crisis may bring unexpected financial hardships to students and their families.

We note St. Louis’ resilience in the face of a pandemic, reminiscing on our community’s response to the influenza pandemic of 1918. An excerpt:</p>\n<p>“In times of crisis, communities pull together. As history has shown, some do this better than others. In St. Louis, if our past is any indication, we have what it takes to dig in and do what is needed to pull through. … We must stay focused, brace ourselves for what comes next, and know that whatever happens, we’ll face it together.”</p>\n<p>God bless you, your families, and Saint Louis University.</p>\n<p>Fred P.

This severely restricts all movement about the city. The intent is to curb the continued spread of COVID-19. There are exceptions, such as visiting the doctor, and going to get food and other essentials, like prescription drugs.</p>\n<p>What this means for SLU</p>\n<p>Saint Louis University made a formal request of the City of St. Louis to receive an exemption so we can continue to keep some core functions open for students who are still living on campus, such as the library.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, until (or unless) we receive that exemption, Pius Library will close at 6 p.m. today until further notice. Those students living on campus who have immediate technology needs should email pandemic@slu.edu.</p>\n<p>While there is no clear education exemption in the city’s order, we are confident that there are several key areas we can and must continue to operate for those students who are still living on campus, and for the greater community. Those include:</p>\n<p>SLUCare, the Student Health Center and the University Counseling Center will continue to operate.</p>\n<p>On-campus food operations will continue to provide “grab &#x26; go” meals.</p>\n<p>Residence halls will operate as a housing consolidation plan is finalized and implemented.

Per previous guidance, those who can work remotely should do so.</p>\n<p>Deans and vice presidents are able to give a letter of exception to those employees who are deemed essential. If the need arises, consult with your dean or vice president.</p>\n<p>What this means for SLU’s research operations</p>\n<p>We ask that you limit laboratory work to essential personnel and essential functions only, this would include maintenance of critical reagents, animals, and equipment; and development of vaccines and treatments directly connected to the current pandemic. Personnel responsible for those functions should be on campus solely for the time necessary to perform those essential functions, and then return to their homes.</p>\n<p>Supervisors may update their list of essential laboratory personnel and justifications here.

This is effective immediately.</p>\n<p>Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing building</p>\n<p>Education Union building</p>\n<p>Allied Health building</p>\n<p>Dreiling Marshall Hall</p>\n<p>As a reminder, faculty and staff will retain access to buildings they are currently approved to access for the purpose of delivering remote education only. For any additional authorization, faculty, staff and students must contact their unit leader who should email DPS (cardaccessdps@slu.edu) and request to add the building to their card access privilege. (Note: This is a different email address than what we shared with you yesterday.

Our goal is to provide flexibility for you, recognizing that this unprecedented situation has created – and will continue to create – challenges for many as we adjust to remote learning.</p>\n<p>Here are a few key points from the updated policy:</p>\n<p>This applies to undergraduate courses only.</p>\n<p>The “pass/low pass/no pass” grades correspond with the typical letter grades of an average grading policy, giving students the option to replace traditional letter grades with P (for Pass, grades A-C), LP (for Low Pass, grades of C- and D), and NP (for No Pass, the grade of F). With this in mind, students should know that choosing this alternative to grading could be problematic for certain program/degree requirements. It also is important to understand that there may be long-term consequences to this decision. For example, particular graduate programs (such as medical schools) might not accept alternative grading policies.</p>\n<p>At the end of the semester, faculty members will submit typical letter grades for students as they normally would. The Office of the Registrar will then map the letter grades to the corresponding pass/low pass/no pass grade.</p>\n<p>Students may request to change from the standard letter grade system in one or more current courses to a pass/low pass/no pass grading system any time from April 27 to May 15. We are still identifying how we will field these requests, so please bear with us and know that information is coming. Students may decide to opt in or opt out of the pass/low pass/no pass grading system, course by course, anytime during that time period, but all decisions are final after May 15.</p>\n<p>There are certain exemptions for specific schools/colleges. More information will be provided soon by your dean.</p>\n<p>We appreciate those of you who have reached out with opinions about this topic. Your feedback has helped advise us on a workable resolution. We are confident this provides the most flexibility for our students to help meet them where they are during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>As I said above, you can expect to hear from your respective dean within the next few days about what nuances might apply to your particular school or college. Again, I encourage you to review the policy in the meantime to get some additional clarity.</p>\n<p>To our students who are considering this alternative option: Please make an informed decision. You have time before you have to decide – use that time to read the policy, wait for guidance from your dean, consult with an academic advisor or mentor, and talk to a loved one. Weigh your options. And again, understand that while many universities are pursuing a similar path, there is still a great unknown about how outside agencies (i.e. accreditation bodies and potential graduate programs) plan to adjust to meet these changes.</p>\n<p>I hope that this clarity helps relieve the anxiety I hear from some of you. Know that we are anxious, too. Nothing about this situation is easy, and we have worked – and will continue to work – extremely hard to create additional pathways to success.</p>\n<p>Thank you, and God bless.</p>\n<p>Chester Gillis, Ph.D.</p>\n<p>Interim Provost</p>","id":"80790186-c5a7-5618-aec4-16be4364890a","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-slu/2020-04-10-14_03_45/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 Update: Grading Policy Changes"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2.files.campus.edublogs.org/favicon.png\"></p>\n<p>Please note latest updates reflect more flexible travel guidelines.</p>\n<p>Following federal and local guidelines recommended to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), SMU is suspending all university-sponsored and/or sanctioned international travel. Students (undergraduates and graduate students) as well as faculty and staff members currently studying or working abroad are requested to return to the U.S. In addition, SMU requests that those returning from university-sponsored and/or sanctioned international travel follow the CDC’s self observation protocol for symptoms for 14 days after leaving that destination.</p>\n<p>SMU Abroad has cancelled all summer abroad programs and is not authorizing university-sponsored and/or sanctioned international travel by students, faculty or staff for the immediate future.</p>\n<p>New guidelines issued March 1 by the Centers for Disease Control and amplified by Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) encourage higher education institutions to consider these measures given the speed of spread and number of countries experiencing human-to-human transmission. We understand the inconvenience this creates and ask for your patience as we work through challenges related to this request.</p>\n<p>Any member of the SMU community who chooses to disregard University recommendations for international travel must understand they will do so at their own risk and may face difficulties in return travel to the U.S. and/or possible restricted access to the SMU campus.</p>\n<p>Undergraduate students currently abroad and the provider companies that support them have all been notified of the international travel suspension for university-sponsored and/or sanctioned program and activities. SMU is evaluating alternative ways for students to complete their courses and educational requirements. SMU Deans and their staffs are working to inform graduate students of this international travel notification.</p>\n<p>We are also in the early stages of notifying undergraduate students signed up for summer programs of these changes. Our SMU Abroad office is committed to providing alternatives by working with SMU Intersessions, SMU-in-Taos and other entities to offer alternative summer options to meet student degree requirements.</p>\n<p>SMU has developed a campus-wide plan to address potential challenges created by the Coronavirus. We have established this blog that will be updated regularly. Please see the post from last week on tips to preventing the spread of the virus.</p>\n<p>Please understand that people across the SMU campus are diligently working to address this rapidly changing situation surrounding the Coronavirus, its potential impacts on our campus, and alternative curriculum options to allow students to continue and complete their studies.

To align with declarations from federal, state and Dallas County health authorities, SMU is moving all classes online for the remainder of the spring semester.</p>\n<p>We also are reducing even further the number of people working on campus. Effective Monday, March 23, the University moves to essential personnel only status until April 3. Employees will be contacted directly by their appropriate vice president or athletics director with guidance on their individual units’ operating plans. All faculty and staff, whether salaried or hourly, will continue to be paid during this period. Please remember to report your time as you normally would.</p>\n<p>Obviously, there will be multiple ripple effects from this decision, and they cannot all be addressed in this letter. Watch the COVID-19 blog for updates on this and other concerns. We also will continue to share important announcements via email.</p>\n<p>Students who had planned to return to their residence halls by April 6 will now need to make arrangements for retrieving and/or storing their possessions. We must manage this check-out process very deliberately to comply with health restrictions. Students will receive detailed information from Residence Life and Student Housing by Friday, March 27. Please do not come to campus to retrieve your belongings until you receive guidance from RLSH.</p>\n<p>SMU is currently determining the best approach for prorating refunds for certain charges such as residence halls and dining. The refund process is currently under development and will be resolved by no later than the end of the semester.</p>\n<p>For those who left town, laws and ordinances have changed dramatically in Dallas County over Spring Break:</p>\n<p>All restaurants and bars in Dallas are permitted to serve food only through take-out, delivery, or drive-through services.</p>\n<p>All gyms are closed.</p>\n<p>Community gatherings of 50 or more individuals (indoors or outdoors) are prohibited – which includes worship services, meetings and conferences.</p>\n<p>Recreational gatherings (indoors or outdoors) of 10 or more individuals are also prohibited – which includes parties, backyard barbecues and sporting events.</p>\n<p>The Dr. Bob Smith Health Center will be open during normal business hours. Students who feel ill should contact the center by phone first at 214-768-2141.</p>\n<p>The scheduled May 16 Commencement is very important to all of us. We are carefully weighing the options and will make a decision at a later date.</p>\n<p>I ask for your continued patience and understanding as we work through the many details and questions that I know you need answered. Your health is of utmost importance during this time, so we all need to take seriously precautions about social distancing, hand washing and other preventive and protective measures. We must look out for each other – not just ourselves.</p>\n<p>The campus has a very different look and feel right now, but this is still SMU and we are committed to continuing our mission. Let’s all look forward to the time when we can return to life as usual on our beautiful campus.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>R.

We will monitor developments in the days ahead and will revisit the possible extension of this plan, as well as our timetable for teaching remotely, on Monday, March 30. We will communicate any changes as soon as decisions are made.</p>\n<p>Each vice president has crafted a plan for their specific area of operation outlining how to meet the responsibilities of their division with reduced on-campus staffing. Those employees identified as “essential personnel” by their supervisor and emergency policy will come to campus, as will those employees identified by their vice president as needed to provide on-site services. Each staff member will hear from their vice president and each faculty member will receive instructions from the provost.</p>\n<p>Even as the plans are being developed for specific University divisions, anyone at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 because of age or a serious long-term health problem that compromises the immune system, or who is experiencing childcare issues, should still work with their supervisor to make alternative work arrangements. Go to the Human Resources site at <a href=\"https://www.smu.edu/BusinessFinance/HR/BenefitsAndWellness/Coronavirus\">https://www.smu.edu/BusinessFinance/HR/BenefitsAndWellness/Coronavirus</a>,</p>\n<p>review the documentation and, if needed, work with your supervisor to fill out the Emergency Telecommuting Arrangement Form.</p>\n<p>Any employee who would like to continue coming to campus to work should do so in consultation with their manager. All employees, however, are urged to monitor their own health judiciously and remain home (while contacting their health provider) if they develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 – dry cough, fever and body aches. And for the health of the University at large, we would appreciate it if any faculty or staff member feeling ill – whether working from campus or from home – would report the information to the University through this form. We will, of course, keep your information confidential and respect your privacy rights.</p>\n<p>As part of this reduced operation plan, University libraries will for the time being be staffed for virtual operations only and will not be open to the University community or the public. The Meadows Museum and Dedman Center for Lifetime Sports will close, at least until April 6.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your flexibility and patience as we roll out new information every day to help us all work through this unprecedented situation. As I’ve said before, please follow this website for the latest we have to share, and stay healthy.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>R.

The University is requesting that as many students as is possible leave the residence halls during Spring Break and remain home until April 5, as we expect normal operations to resume on April 6.</p>\n<p>International and other students who need to remain living in the residence halls should formally request approval from the Office of Residence Life and Student Housing to stay on campus. RLSH will send a message directly to residents containing additional information outlining the process. The campus will remain open and operational. Limited food service will still be available, the Dr. Bob Smith Health Center, the Meadows Museum and the SMU Childcare Center will remain open, as will Fondren Library. However, Dedman Center for Lifetime Sports will close during this period.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff should plan to report to campus as usual during this period. As a reminder, the University is providing training March 18-19 to upgrade faculty skills in delivering online instruction. We also recognize that some faculty or staff members may have medical vulnerability or childcare issues to consider moving forward, and we will direct you to the process for requesting special accommodations via this website.</p>\n<p>Some types of instruction may not be fully deliverable online, as in the visual and performing arts and laboratory sciences, and these will be addressed individually. Our goal is to prevent interruption of anyone’s degree plan – particularly graduating seniors.</p>\n<p>Student advising for May term, summer, August and fall classes will also be handled online during the two-week period following Spring Break.</p>\n<p>In addition to moving classroom instruction online, SMU is canceling or postponing on-campus gatherings of more than 50 people through the end of April. We are establishing an appeals process to consider exceptions for some types of events. At this time, we still intend to hold Commencement Convocation on May 16.</p>\n<p>These decisions raise questions for many of you, and we will continue to address them in coming days. Please continue to monitor this site and the FAQ section.</p>\n<p>We do not make these decisions lightly, but out of an abundance of caution. As I noted previously, we are currently planning for normal classroom instruction to resume April 6, but everyone is asked to remain patient and flexible as we work through this challenging time. We are determined to deliver on our education mission while maintaining the priority of the health and well-being of our campus community. Please understand that if circumstances mandate further change, we will continue to adjust. SMU is a community of smart, motivated and compassionate people who will work through this.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for your patience, and stay healthy.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>R.

Enrollment for May and June classes for current SMU students opens Monday, April 13, and the priority enrollment deadline is Friday, April 24.</p>\n<p>The University has not yet decided how classes scheduled to start in July will be offered. Courses that start in July are currently listed in the Schedule of Classes as taking place on campus, but this is under review. Enrollment opens on April 13th for all summer courses including those that start in July. Students enrolling in a summer course that starts in July need to be aware that the delivery of the course may change. An announcement will be made later.</p>\n<p>Many of the courses previously listed for May term at SMU-in-Taos will be offered online, while others that are site-dependent, such as “Photography in Taos,” will not. None of the field school classes previously scheduled for June at SMU-in-Taos will be available. Students with questions about SMU-in Taos courses may contact Rumanda Young at rkyoung@smu.edu or Lashanda Phillips at lashandap@smu.edu.</p>\n<p>More than fifty percent of our SMU students who graduate in four years take advantage of the Intersession courses offered during breaks between semesters and over the summer. We understand that the availability of these courses is key to timely progress toward your degree and hope you will take full advantage of what is being offered online. May and June courses can provide opportunities for students whose internships have been cancelled or shortened due to COVID-19, and it’s not too late for students to request specific May/summer courses through the SMU Intersession “Wish List” or the SMU-in-Taos “Wish List.”</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience as we continue to adapt to the changing health needs of our SMU community and neighbors.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Peter K.

This will affect 234 undergraduates currently planning to study abroad in eight international locations.</p>\n<p>This decision follows the recent recommendation made by the University for all members of the community to reconsider any international travel plans. In addition to the spread of the virus itself, students may face unpredictable circumstances overseas during the spring quarter, including accessing health care while abroad, navigating disruptions to local services, and the potential for travel interruptions or restrictions. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has also issued guidance this week for institutes of higher education to consider suspending or postponing study abroad programs.</p>\n<p>On-site instruction in BOSP Florence was suspended last week due to a surge in COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and an abundance of caution on the part of Stanford. Based on current intelligence, there are no plans to end other winter quarter programs early. BOSP continues to monitor guidance daily from the CDC, the U.S. Department of State, the World Health Organization, Stanford’s Public Health Policy Committee, as well as communicating regularly with on-site staff and consulting with peer institutions.</p>\n<p>Stanford remains deeply committed to global education and the mission of BOSP. We intend to resume our programs as soon as we are able.</p>\n<p>Below you’ll find FAQs that were created to help you navigate next steps including academic planning for spring quarter, making changes to travel arrangements, available housing on campus, and more. Our BOSP staff are prepared to support and assist you throughout this process.</p>\n<p>What about housing for spring quarter?</p>\n<p>All students who apply for spring quarter housing will be offered a housing assignment.</p>\n<p>Students who currently live in student housing on the main Stanford campus, who will no longer be going overseas, may remain in their current room assignments. To do so, please submit a Services &#x26; Support ticket to request to rescind your termination for Spring Quarter. Your deadline to submit this help ticket is 5pm on Friday, March 6. If you submit your help ticket by the deadline, you will not have to change housing assignments for spring quarter.</p>\n<p>Students with housing related questions can submit a help ticket for assistance or call the Housing Assignment office at 650-725-2810.</p>\n<p>Who can I speak with about academic concerns, including my Spring Quarter course registration on campus?</p>\n<p>All Spring quarter BOSP classes will be cancelled by the Office of the University Registrar by the end of day Friday, March 6, 2020, and as a result, previously enrolled students will be dropped from these classes. Please log in to Axess to adjust your Spring study list.</p>\n<p>If you have questions or concerns about registering for classes for the spring quarter, please get in touch with your Academic Advisor (AAD or AARC advisor).

Will Stanford reimburse me?</p>\n<p>BOSP will reimburse airline change fees upon presentation of documentation and receipts. Many airlines are adjusting their policies due to the COVID-19 outbreak and this may impact your airline ticket. BOSP strongly suggests that you call (not attempt to do online) the issuer of your plane ticket, whether issued directly by an airline or by a travel agent, and inquire about any waivers or refunds that may apply to the specific ticket you purchased. You may also be assessed a “fare difference”; BOSP will not reimburse any “fare difference.”</p>\n<p>This should be done as soon as possible and must be completed before your currently scheduled departure date.</p>\n<p>Documentation and receipts may be submitted to BOSP at: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/msXWLur2tC35zpVN7\">https://forms.gle/msXWLur2tC35zpVN7</a></p>\n<p>Please address any flight reimbursement concerns to bospsupport@stanford.edu</p>\n<p>How will my University Bill be affected?</p>\n<p>BOSP has taken action to update your student account to reflect the suspension of the program. The Financial Aid Office and Student Financial Services have been notified of your change in status and your University Bill has been updated. Your financial aid award will be revised this week to reflect your aid prior to the overseas adjustment. If you have specific questions about how your financial aid has been impacted, please contact the Financial Aid Office directly.</p>\n<p>Your University account will be updated with any changes to your tuition and fees.

It provides that all university courses (with the exception of those offered by the Graduate School of Business, the School of Law and the School of Medicine MD program unless opted in by those schools) will be Satisfactory/No Credit for Spring Quarter 2019-20.</p>\n<p>The formal legislation adopted by the Senate, which includes several other related policy changes, is available at the Faculty Senate site: <a href=\"https://facultysenate.stanford.edu\">https://facultysenate.stanford.edu</a></p>\n<p>Below is a message from Faculty Senate Chair Tim Stearns further describing the policy changes.</p>\n<p>The Faculty Senate has adopted a Spring Quarter 2019-20 grading policy of Satisfactory/No Credit. We have heard from a number of students who are anxious about how this change in grading policy might disadvantage them as well as from faculty who are concerned about the impact on their courses. These are understandable concerns.</p>\n<p>During such distressing times amid unprecedented circumstances, when most students have been displaced to homes around the world and faculty are being asked to rapidly shift their classroom courses to untested online environments, our entire Stanford community has been challenged to consider how we can best meet this moment with understanding, agility, and grace. Within this context, I hope the information below offers greater clarity around why the Senate reached its conclusive resolution.</p>\n<p>The Faculty Senate spent nearly four hours examining Stanford’s grading policy for Spring Quarter in a special session held online. The proposed changes came from the Academic Continuity Group chaired by Professor Sarah Church, based on input from faculty members and the evolving COVID-19 situation. Prior to the Senate meeting they were discussed and voted on by C-USP and C-GS, the Senate committees tasked with considering undergraduate and graduate policy, respectively, and they were presented to the Senate by the chairs of those committees, Professor Adam Banks (C-USP) and Professor Gary Shaw (C-GS). In addition, a proposal from the Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) was presented by ASSU representatives Erica Scott and Isaiah Drummond.</p>\n<p>Among the key points of consideration during the discussion:</p>\n<p>ensuring education equity, given that some students, especially those within our most vulnerable communities, may have limited access to broadband connection or find themselves in challenging home environments ill-suited for learning and quiet study</p>\n<p>the unpredictable nature of how any number of courses may translate in a virtual format</p>\n<p>embracing a primary focus on learning rather than traditional course assessment</p>\n<p>the extra pressures on student mental health during an indefinite period of crisis</p>\n<p>The ASSU representatives who spoke at the Faculty Senate meeting made a compelling case that equity considerations—particularly for FLI students and students with disabilities—argued for a change to a A+/A/NC grading basis for spring quarter. This proposal did not resonate with the Senate for a variety of reasons. Many Senators felt that the equity considerations the students had raised were best addressed by the uniform S/NC system and others felt that faculty would be uncomfortable with assigning, for example, an “A” grade to work that might otherwise have received a “C” grade.</p>\n<p>The Faculty Senate also shared a growing concern for the likelihood that a substantial number of students or instructors could become sick, possibly hospitalized, with COVID-19, and that we are best served as a community by removing any unnecessary barriers for successful navigation and completion of spring quarter.</p>\n<p>Please know that colleges and universities nationwide are reaching comparable decisions, including Stanford’s peer institutions. Leading medical schools and other graduate and professional schools are acknowledging this new reality, and some have already announced that applicants will not be disadvantaged in the admission process for taking ungraded courses this spring. As a result of the Faculty Senate decision, Stanford will</p>\n<p>place a notation on student transcripts indicating that emergency grading was in effect for Spring Quarter 2019-20</p>\n<p>ask faculty to continue to track grades in courses, so that students get feedback on their performance, and faculty can disclose those grades in a reference letter if a student requests it</p>\n<p>These distressing, unparalleled times are forcing university communities to quickly adapt to new ways of teaching, learning, working, living, and navigating the stark realities around us. Best wishes to you, your family, and your local community during such a challenging period.</p>\n<p>Tim Stearns, Ph.D.</p>\n<p>Frank Lee and Carol Hall Professor</p>\n<p>Chair, Department of Biology</p>\n<p>Chair, Faculty Senate</p>","id":"8c9291d0-6723-5a97-b1b9-0de71d50ed5d","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-stanford/2020-04-08-23_37_52/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spring Quarter grading policy"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://healthalerts.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/03/MTL.jpg\"></p>\n<p>To our Stanford family:</p>\n<p>I am writing you at the end of an extraordinary week. Whether you are here in the Bay Area, or elsewhere around the world, we have all been affected by COVID-19 and the policies being put in place to combat it. The shelter-in-place orders issued across the Bay Area on Monday—and statewide in California on Thursday—have affected all of us at Stanford in different ways: from pausing research, to canceling events, to requiring almost all undergraduates to leave campus.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, we announced that spring quarter courses will be taught online for the duration of the quarter. I know that this news has come as a significant disappointment to all, and especially to our students. I deeply regret that many of you will not be living and studying on campus this spring. Unfortunately, it became clear that this was the only responsible course of action, considering the global public health challenge in front of us and the possibility that shelter-in-place guidelines will be extended. But I truly wish it were otherwise.</p>\n<p>To those of you in the class of 2020, graduating this spring: I know many of you must be heartbroken to spend your final quarter away from Stanford and that we will not be able to hold our traditional Commencement ceremony in June. This is not how you expected—and not how any of us expected—you would complete your Stanford degrees. All of us at Stanford are incredibly proud of you, and of the resilience and ingenuity of our entire student body, which has been so evident in the midst of this crisis. We are committed to celebrating you and your tremendous accomplishments together on campus. At this point, we do not know what the timing or the format will be, but we are working to make this gathering a fitting recognition, in spite of the upheaval. I thank you for your patience while we work through these issues. We will reach out directly to graduating students and their families as soon as we have information to share.</p>\n<p>Remote learning is new for many of our students. And while I understand that you may be uncertain about how the experience will unfold, I am heartened by the work our faculty is doing to ensure the best possible remote learning experience for all of our students. Since remote learning was announced, faculty members have been focused on using this opportunity to rethink and advance online learning, leveraging technology to make this a rich learning experience in all disciplines.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, staff across campus are striving to provide, remotely, many of the same services students would normally receive on-campus: from telehealth and phone support through CAPS, to virtual FLI Fridays, to opportunities to experience the arts at Stanford online. While I know that this is not the same as being on campus, I hope you are able to embrace these opportunities and the possibilities they offer for new experiences and perspectives.</p>\n<p>I also encourage you to remain connected with one another. Earlier this week, Mary and I walked our dog on what is, now, a mostly empty campus. But we did see a few students, faculty, and staff members, and we spoke with them—from a safe distance—about how they are adapting to this strange time we are living through. Those interactions highlighted for me that, though we are forced to remain socially distant, these circumstances are forming a deep bond between all of us who are living through them. Though our Stanford community is now dispersed around the Bay Area, the nation, and the world, I hope you use technology to stay connected not only to your work, but to one another. While maintaining a physical distance is vital right now, I also encourage you to embrace the concept of “distant socializing,” to maintain our connections with one another in this challenging time.</p>\n<p>As we all settle into this new reality, and even as many of our students and faculty members are absorbed with final exams and projects in the next week, I hope all of you are able to spend time with your loved ones at home. I know that many in our community now have additional family responsibilities on top of their usual work. Many of us are worried for our older relatives. Others are suddenly responsible for homeschooling children, or are caring for toddlers who are home from daycare. These concerns are paramount.</p>\n<p>I also know that some families may be experiencing financial hardships during this difficult time. I want to encourage any students or families who are in need to work with the Financial Aid Office to determine what support may be available to them.</p>\n<p>Although there will continue to be twists and turns as this crisis unfolds, I want to assure you that our resolve is undiminished. In the near and medium term, we will continue to focus relentlessly on supporting our community and other communities; on preserving operations, including teaching, as best we can; and on contributing to combatting the pandemic and saving lives through our research and clinical care. At the same time, I believe it is not too soon for us to begin to plan for the longer term. So, in parallel, I am convening a Recovery Team to think through how we will manage the aftermath of this crisis and get our campus back to a new normal.</p>\n<p>Before I close, I want to express my thanks to every member of our community. You have all made sacrifices to advance the well-being of our community, even in a moment of great personal challenge. For this, I am profoundly grateful. Thank you, also, to all who have communicated your needs or shared ideas for how we can best accomplish our work in these challenging times. I appreciate your feedback and your input. We are listening, and we are working hard to find solutions as quickly as possible to the challenges that this situation presents.</p>\n<p>I also want to offer my deepest gratitude to everybody at Stanford Health Care, who are on the front lines as we cope with this pandemic. The COVID-19 test developed at Stanford has rapidly expanded capacity to test and serve patients in the Bay Area and beyond. Clinicians, researchers, and staff are working around the clock to care for our community and conduct research into vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges we are all facing now, I am confident that, by standing together as a community, we will emerge from this moment stronger and more resilient. Thank you, again, for the actions you are each taking to support the well-being of all.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Marc</p>","id":"33ec3a0e-1b40-5123-85de-25e0ae4df32f","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-stanford/2020-04-08-23_38_00/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Message from the president"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://healthalerts.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/03/Provost.jpg\"></p>\n<p>To our university community,</p>\n<p>As Stanford’s winter quarter comes to a close – amid unprecedented circumstances and, in turn, entirely new ways of teaching, learning, working and living – I want to share some high-level updates about the way in which the university will approach spring quarter.</p>\n<p>President Tessier-Lavigne announced on March 10 that spring quarter would begin with virtual instruction, in lieu of in-person classes. Given the increasing uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak and the potential for shelter-in-place guidelines to be extended, along with our desire to limit the amount of disruption that any mid- or late-quarter course adjustments would invariably introduce, we have now determined that spring quarter courses will be taught online for the entire duration of the quarter.</p>\n<p>We recognize the challenges this decision introduces for our community. We are making the decision in recognition of the seriousness of the global public health challenge in front of us, and we are making it now in order to assist your planning to the greatest extent possible. Stanford will continue to provide resources and support to ensure that students meet their academic goals and can engage with their instructors and their coursework in deep and robust ways. The university also remains committed to providing faculty with necessary support to transition successfully to an online teaching environment, and the teachanywhere site has a number of resources to assist with this.</p>\n<p>To assist with this transition, we will delay the start of spring quarter by one week, until Monday, April 6, in all schools except the Graduate School of Business, School of Law and School of Medicine. These three professional schools will follow their already planned spring schedules. This delay will allow instructors time to develop course offerings that are consistent with Stanford’s expectations of a high-quality learning experience. The delay also will offer students and instructors who are still finishing winter quarter exams a chance to rest and recuperate after a particularly challenging quarter.</p>\n<p>Spring quarter will still end on time, on June 10. The decision to not extend spring quarter recognizes the need to not disrupt summer internship plans and/or post-graduation employment for our students. However, we are making an additional change to ensure that instructors can complete their classes: There will be no traditional final exam period for timed exams. Rather, instructors will continue teaching to the quarter’s end on June 10, using in-class quizzes and out-of-class assignments throughout the quarter to assess student performance. This decision recognizes the difficulties with administering timed high-stakes exams to students in a wide range of time zones, and whose access to quiet exam-taking space varies widely. It also allows instructors to include all of their previously planned course content despite the delayed start of the quarter.</p>\n<p>We know that these decisions about the spring quarter may affect housing considerations. For undergraduates who already have left campus, we will be in further touch with you soon about plans for getting the belongings in your residences back in your possession. For graduate students who have on-campus housing, we also want to provide flexibility to you given these changes for the spring quarter. We are extending from March 24 to Monday, March 30, the deadline to file a termination of occupancy notice with no fee.</p>\n<p>Finally, I’m very sorry to convey that because of this continuing situation, and the strong likelihood that prohibitions on large gatherings will remain in place by later this spring, we do not expect to be able to hold this year’s Commencement in its traditional form. I share your disappointment at having to arrive at this place, which again is the product of the extraordinary circumstances around us. We absolutely recognize the importance of this treasured milestone for our students, and we are working on a number of options that will allow us to honor our Stanford graduates appropriately and celebrate together. We will be coming back to you soon with thoughts on how we can best do that.</p>\n<p>More information about these spring quarter changes is addressed on the teachanywhere site. I know that you will have questions, too. Please use the health-alerts@stanford.edu email address and we will work to get you answers as expeditiously as possible.</p>\n<p>As we navigate this challenging period, I continue to be grateful for the collective patience and resilience of our university community during a time of great ambiguity and disruption. I am heartened by how our Stanford community has so quickly come together in support of one another – even while dispersed locally and across numerous states, nations and time zones. Please continue to reach out as needed for support, resources and guidance. We will continue to work to support your academic goals and our collective academic mission.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Persis Drell</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>Correction: This post has been updated to clarify that the spring quarter concludes on June 10.</p>","id":"69ed0b15-ccc2-5d23-a5ed-491ea5a16c98","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-stanford/2020-04-08-23_38_05/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stanford update for Thursday evening, March 19: New information on spring quarter"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://healthalerts.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/03/MTL.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Dear members of our Stanford community,</p>\n<p>It is my custom to send a message to our community at the start of each quarter. In normal times, this provides an opportunity to celebrate the joy of everyone converging back on campus, energized by a restorative break, and fueled with excitement as classes resume.</p>\n<p>On this occasion, however, very little seems normal. Our spring quarter begins online, and at a challenging moment for everyone in our community, as we each navigate significant upheaval in our personal, academic and professional lives. And so, my message today is about our university’s commitment to supporting you through this strange and disrupted time.</p>\n<p>In difficult moments like this one, we must seek comfort where we can. I hope that you have already found some in the familiar — in your family, friends, or in the places you grew up or call home. But I also hope that as this new quarter begins, you find some solace in engaging, as best you can, with your chosen field of work or study. With so much upheaval over the last couple weeks, I hope that reconnecting with your work brings you a sense of normalcy and reassurance and that you have the chance to find inspiration in new ideas and perspectives.</p>\n<p>Our faculty have worked hard to make this a fulfilling and enriching quarter for learners in all disciplines. I’m excited by the creative ways they will be introducing course material to our students. For example, students in an ITALIC seminar will collaborate to design an educational art magazine for Bay Area high school students. A geological sciences course has mailed all students the pieces used in chemistry sets to build crystal structures — a physical project they can work on together, despite the distance. I hope you find these new modes of learning invigorating, and that they offer you new ways of looking at your studies.</p>\n<p>While our physical campus is quiet, our digital campus is thriving. Many groups and organizations across the university have put material online to supplement your learning and your well-being throughout the spring quarter. The Cantor Arts Center, the Anderson Collection, and the David Rumsey Map Center are all offering virtual tours of their collections. Stanford Live has shared a “digital season” on its website, featuring many of the artists who were scheduled to perform on campus this quarter. The Office for Religious Life is providing daily reflections, regular opportunities for virtual gatherings, and other opportunities to connect. I am confident this is just a start, and that we will see many other offerings brought to life by members of our community as the quarter progresses.</p>\n<p>I also encourage you to engage with campus resources that help sustain the emotional health of our community, should you need additional help during this difficult time. The pandemic has affected each of us personally but in various ways. I’m conscious that, for many in our community, sheltering in place means increased family responsibilities — such as caring for loved ones or homeschooling children — and less time to focus on your studies or work. For others, the isolation may feel overwhelming, especially in this time of increased anxiety, when we need one another more than ever.</p>\n<p>I urge all of you to use technology to remain connected to your friends, mentors, and colleagues. I also encourage you to share your challenges with your instructors, department chairs, or managers, who can help you find ways to remain connected to your work and studies as you manage additional obligations at home. And no matter what difficulties you face, we are here to support you. CAPS remains available to students 24/7 by phone, and in some cases video, and is also available to assist students in finding care in their home communities. Clinicians from Confidential Support Team and the Weiland Health Initiative are available to connect with students through virtual platforms. In addition, well-being coaches are available for you, no matter where you are residing. The Faculty Staff Help Center remains open and available to connect remotely with faculty, staff, and postdocs.</p>\n<p>In addition to our other campus resources, we will continue to offer you ways throughout the quarter to remain closely connected with Stanford leadership. This afternoon at 2 p.m. PDT, Provost Persis Drell and I will host a Zoom-based conversation with the university community about the COVID-19 crisis and Stanford’s response. I hope you will join us.</p>\n<p>Many people have asked me when we’ll be able to reopen our campus and research labs, and have students, faculty, and staff all back at Stanford. We don’t have an answer to that, yet — much will depend on the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic in the coming weeks, and on the guidance of public health officials. For now, we are most focused on safeguarding the health of our community; maintaining our operations as best we can, and contributing to the pandemic response through clinical care and research.</p>\n<p>However, as I announced in my message a couple weeks ago, I am convening a Recovery Team focused on how to bring the campus back to a new normal and on longer-term questions about the aftermath of this crisis. The coronavirus pandemic is one of the most challenging public health crises of our lifetimes. Its aftermath, and the social upheaval it has caused, will be difficult, too. Our world will be different when this is over, in ways large and small.</p>\n<p>But we will also learn a great deal: about pandemic response; about the nature of our interconnected world; about our innate social needs; and about the opportunities and challenges associated with online learning, telemedicine, and remote work. It will be up to all of us to consider how we can take these lessons and use them to make our world better, and how Stanford can best contribute to the world that emerges.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that this is a challenging moment for our community. Provost Drell’s message last Thursday outlined some of the serious financial impacts that COVID-19 will have on our university. We will face tough choices in the coming months as we steer Stanford through this downturn and work to sustain our mission of teaching and research.</p>\n<p>But through this difficult time, Stanford’s purpose, to pursue knowledge for the benefit of humanity and the world, has never been more important. I am certain that, with our shared resolve and Stanford’s collective ingenuity, we will emerge from this moment stronger, with new ways of thinking, learning, and working together.</p>\n<p>I want to close, once more, by expressing my gratitude to each of you for your patience, your understanding, and your partnership as we navigate this difficult time together. I am deeply grateful to all who are working and learning at a distance, as well as to those whose work continues to bring them to campus and to our hospitals. I look forward to the day when we are all together once more. But while physical distance is necessary, the work of the university continues. I wish you all the best for a quarter that is as enriching and fulfilling as it can be despite the circumstances, and I hope that we all remain closely connected, personally and intellectually.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Marc</p>","id":"991a9c90-5e64-5aff-9288-8673f3b2aa11","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-stanford/2020-04-10-14_04_08/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"President’s spring message to the Stanford community"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h2>Health Advisory &#x26; Campus Update</h2>\n<p><em>Updated  April 1, 2020, 4:15 PM</em></p>\n<p><strong>To:</strong> Stevens Community<br>\n<strong>From:</strong> Christophe Pierre, Provost<br>\n<strong>Date:  ** April 1, 2020<br>\n**Subject:</strong>   Summer 2020 Semester to Be Held Online </p>\n<p>Due to continued uncertainty about when activity on campus can resume, we are moving all classes for both the Summer I and Summer II sessions online.</p>\n<p>Although we remain hopeful that we will all be able to return to campus in the not-so-distant future, we are making this move now to provide a degree of certainty to our students and faculty as they plan their schedules. </p>\n<p>Both summer sessions will take place as scheduled: Summer I classes will start May 19; Summer II classes will begin on July 13.

Many of these have since been patched, but others remain due to the way Zoom works and since the remaining issues are not necessarily technical in nature.</p>\n<p>If you use Zoom for anything, whether it be teaching, learning, or meetings, it is important that you read this message and follow the recommendations and instructions below to ensure you are protected against any malicious activity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ensure your Zoom desktop software or mobile app is updated to the latest version.  **<br>\n_ **You must ensure this is done ASAP before your next Zoom meeting!</strong>_<br>\nFollow these steps depending on the platform you use: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using Windows, sign in to the Zoom application, select your user badge in the top-right corner of the Zoom window (with your initials), and select “Check for Updates”. You should see the message “You are up to date”. If this is not the case, follow the on-screen instructions to update your Zoom software to the latest version.</li>\n<li>If you are using Mac, you can use the same steps as described above, or instead, select “zoom.us” at the top-left corner of the screen, and select “Check for Updates…”. You should see the message “You are up to date”. If this is not the case, follow the on-screen instructions to update your Zoom software to the latest version.</li>\n<li>If you are using a mobile device, check the app store for your specific device.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Password protect all your Zoom meetings.</strong><br>\nThis means that only people with both the meeting ID and password can join your meeting. You should check any previously scheduled or recurring Zoom meetings to ensure you have set a password.</li>\n<li><strong>Disable the “Join Before Host” feature.</strong><br>\nDisabling this feature will give you better control of your meeting by requiring the host to be present and initiate the meeting before any participants can join.</li>\n<li><strong>Use the “Waiting Rooms” feature whenever possible.</strong><br>\nThis allows the host to control when a participant joins the meeting. The host can admit attendees one by one or hold all attendees in the waiting room and admit them all at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not publish your Zoom meeting ID on external sites.</strong><br>\nAvoid posting the Zoom meeting ID or invite link on public websites when at all possible. If you need to have the Zoom session accessible from a link on the internet, put the meeting URL as a hyperlink inside the message text. While this doesn’t necessarily increase security, it makes it more difficult for unwanted audiences to find out the meeting information.</li>\n<li><strong>Use caution when opening any links in the Zoom chat window.</strong><br>\nSimilar to a phishing attack, opening any malicious link in the Zoom chat window can allow someone to gain access to user credentials though the actions of unsuspecting meeting participants. Only the host should post links if necessary and should specifically notify the meeting participants when doing so. While this security vulnerability has now been patched, attendees with Zoom clients that haven't been updated can potentially still introduce the issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have created the <a href=\"https://sit.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1865/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=103510\">Best Practices for Securing Zoom Meetings</a> page which provides more information on how to perform these steps as well as other recommendations on how to keep your Zoom meetings safe and secure.

The student has not visited campus for a number of weeks. As in the prior cases, we will follow Hoboken Health Department protocols. At this time, we have some good news about some of the cases in our community.  Two students and one staff member have recovered and are awaiting clearance from their medical professionals to leave self-isolation. One student and one staff member are improving and recovering at home.  An additional staff member is hospitalized and stable.  We are sending our thoughts and prayers for a quick recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Tuition Refunds</strong><br>\nAs you know, the coronavirus pandemic prompted a sudden and unanticipated transition to online learning and remote business and student service operations for colleges across the U.S. and the world.  This transition was critical not only to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and the greater Hoboken community, it was mandated by an Executive Order from the Governor of New Jersey, and later, by the President of the United States.  As many students had already made significant progress toward their coursework in the current semester, Stevens, like other institutions across the country, is fulfilling its commitment to students by delivering coursework online and providing ongoing related support services. Since all courses will continue to be offered online through the end of the semester, and students will receive course credit, tuition will not be refunded.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Resources and Information</strong><br>\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, please immediately contact Stevens Student Health Services at 201-216-5678 or <a href=\"mailto:studenthealthcenter@stevens.edu\">studenthealthcenter@stevens.edu</a>.</p>\n<p>For those experiencing anxiety and stress due to the COVID-19 emergency, the N.J.

The message reads as follows:</p>\n<p>We recognize that this semester is unlike any other and has created a great deal of anxiety and confusion. The purpose of this communication is to clarify some of the issues regarding grading for the Spring 2020. Please keep in mind that these changes are in effect for only the Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>All classes that began the semester with a grading scale of A – F or S/U will continue with it. Rather than the GPNC system that you are used to, we are moving forward with a Pass/No Credit option for this semester. As is currently true with GPNC, schools and colleges will have the opportunity to opt out of the Pass/No Credit option.</p>\n<p>If permitted by their program, students will have the chance to designate if they want a grade or Pass/No Credit. There is no limit on the number of courses that can be designated Pass/No Credit. This designation must be made no later than the last day of the classes, Saturday May 9, 2020.</p>\n<p>All grades of ‘C’ or better will be considered a Pass.</p>\n<p>For this semester, a Pass will satisfy both SBC and Major requirements. As is true for GPNC, faculty will not know which students adopt the Pass/No Credit option Schools and colleges will notify students by March 30th, the day classes resume, if students will be able to take the Pass/No Credit option.

The message reads as follows:</p>\n<p>President Bernstein sent an email to the campus community on Saturday night advising that we have started to see confirmed COVID-19 cases at Stony Brook. Currently, we have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among our 2,000 residents who continue to live and study in campus housing, but we anticipate that as testing increases, there will be positive COVID-19 cases among our resident community. We are committed to providing care should you become sick with COVID-19 or any other health issue. In addition, should another resident become sick, we will follow our protocol related to care and communication as detailed below.</p>\n<p>What precautions should I take to be healthy and safe?</p>\n<p>Please take the following steps to protect yourself and others. Your personal hygiene is crucial in curbing the spread of this virus:</p>\n<p>Maintain social distancing at all times (6 feet apart from others)</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands</p>\n<p>Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks</p>\n<p>If you share a bathroom with others, clean all surfaces before and after use</p>\n<p>Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</p>\n<p>Stay in your room if you are sick and avoid contact with others</p>\n<p>What should I do if I am sick?</p>\n<p>If you are experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath, please seek medical attention right away. Call Student Health at 631-632-6740 to speak with a healthcare professional who will advise you on appropriate next steps.</p>\n<p>If you become ill and test positive for COVID-19, Campus Residences and Student Health Services will assign you to a single room in a separate residence hall, apart from any other residents, for a self-isolation period of 14 days (or more, depending upon symptoms). Ongoing care will be provided to you from Student Health Services and CAPS, and meals will be delivered to your building from Campus Dining.</p>\n<p>What happens if someone in our residential community is diagnosed with COVID-19?</p>\n<p>Upon confirming a resident is positive for COVID-19, Student Health Services will begin a contact investigation and work with our local Department of Health to identify and notify those who have come in close contact with the student, such as roommates, suitemates and apartment mates. These close contacts will be notified expeditiously by Student Health and provided directions as to the necessary steps to be taken. Confidentiality of the student with COVID-19 will be maintained. In addition, our facilities staff will be notified and promptly follow the necessary cleaning protocol.</p>\n<p>We care about you and all of our students.

Robbins, Vice Provost Undergraduate Education and Student Success/Dean of the Undergraduate Colleges, has released further guidance to faculty on managing disruptions of Zoom classrooms. The message reads as follows:</p>\n<p>We appreciate how hard you have worked to transition your courses to remote delivery. As I am sure you are aware, Zoom classes and meetings across the country have been disrupted by unruly individuals using hateful speech and images. You have received some guidance on how to secure your class and reduce the likelihood of these disruptions (see Prevent and Manage Disruptions in Your Zoom Sessions). Be sure to take the steps necessary to secure your Zoom class; if you require set up assistance, please refer to this site or email CELT@stonybrook.edu. Although unlikely, it is still possible that your class could be disrupted.</p>\n<p>In addition to the guidance recommended above, there are additional steps you should take to secure your classroom and ensure a safe and appropriate learning environment for everyone.</p>\n<p>Inform your class that you and the University expect a learning environment built on civility and mutual respect. Indicate that any actions that diverge from this expectation will be dealt with swiftly. Inform students that most classes are typically recorded and those who violate these principles will be identified and referred to the Office of University Community Standards and/or Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity. If found responsible, students can face discipline ranging from a warning to a suspension or expulsion from the University. Facilitating another person’s entry into the class with the purpose of disruption is also a serious violation of the Code of Student Responsibility.</p>\n<p>If there is a disruption in your class, please take the necessary steps to keep control of your class. Your students need to see you maintain your composure and model authority. It is equally important that you not end the class. That sends the wrong message to the students, who deserve to have your full attention and see a resolution. Try to use this as a teaching moment in students’ professional development.</p>\n<p>Familiarize yourself with these steps:</p>\n<p>Prevent participants from screen sharing – click the arrow next to “Share Screen”, and then select Advanced Sharing Options. Under “Who can share?”, select Only Host.</p>\n<p>Mute the participant, click Manage Participants. A tab called Participants should appear on the right. Hover over the name of the desired participant and select More. Click Mute.</p>\n<p>Stop the participant’s video – click Manage Participants. Hover over the name of the desired participant and select More. Click Stop Video.</p>\n<p>Remove the participant – click Manage Participants. Hover over the name of the desired participant and select More. Click Remove.</p>\n<p>Lock the meeting – Once a meeting is locked, no one else can join. To lock your meeting: click Manage Participants. Click More in the bottom right. Click Lock Meeting.</p>\n<p>After the class, contact stonybrook.edu/reportit or communitystandards@stonybrook.edu. If appropriate contact University Police.</p>\n<p>If problems persist, please let the Provost’s Office know so that we can assist you.</p>\n<p>Interim President issues video message on Commencement 2020</p>\n<p>April 2, 2020</p>\n<p>Interim President Michael Bernstein has shared a video message with students, faculty and staff regarding this year’s Commencement. The message reads as follows:</p>\n<p>I have an important and poignant message to share with the members of the Class of 2020. Amidst all the challenges that have come your way due to the COVID-19 pandemic — the abrupt transition to on-line learning, the imposition of strict social-distancing protocols that have cancelled campus events and activities, the fearsome threat of the coronavirus itself, to name a few — it is now also clear that we will not be able to hold our Spring Commencement ceremony in person on Friday, May 22.</p>\n<p>We have made this difficult decision in a deliberate and careful way with input from our medical experts, and in conformity with guidelines established by the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Governor’s Office of the State of New York.</p>\n<p>Our choice ensures the well-being of our community and loved ones.</p>\n<p>I assure you all appropriately completed degrees will be conferred as scheduled – and, as needed, information will be forwarded to professional licensing bodies. You should expect receipt of your formal diplomas within two months of your graduation date.</p>\n<p>As I know you are aware, countless graduation celebrations are now being reimagined nationwide for the Class of 2020. These unexpected and disheartening circumstances will not, of course, make these occasions any less significant nor less joyous. The accomplishments we will celebrate on your behalf will always be real and vivid.</p>\n<p>In this regard, I want to thank you for gifting us a moment of joy during an otherwise extremely difficult time. It is important to remember that even now, exciting milestones are still reached. Your accomplishments will lift our spirits immensely.</p>\n<p>We have begun assessing alternatives for the May Commencement Ceremony. A team of University faculty, staff, and students are evaluating several options. I particularly want to thank the USG and GSO leadership for providing their insights in this effort and for working to secure the input of their peers. Of course, as decisions are made, you will receive timely updates from the University Commencement Office through your Stony Brook University e-mail address.</p>\n<p>Whatever ultimate arrangements we make, it is also our intention that on May 22 itself, we will bring together our graduating class in a virtual setting so that we may formally bestow your degrees. Details about this event will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>I am very sorry that your final semester at Stony Brook has been derailed by this tragic public health crisis. And I want to thank all of you who in so many ways have supported our community as we confront this unprecedented emergency. It’s that very spirit for which your class – the Class of 2020 — will always be uniquely known.</p>\n<p>University releases message on changes to Summer Sessions</p>\n<p>April 2, 2020</p>\n<p>Minghua Zhang, Interim Provost and Senior Vice-President for Academic Affairs, has issued a message to students regarding changes to Summer Session. The message reads as follows:</p>\n<p>As we finalize our preparations for the rest of this semester, we are beginning plans for the coming academic terms. As we make these decisions, we continue to hold your health and well-being, and that of the entire University community, as our top priority.</p>\n<p>You have just received an email with information about Summer and Fall registration. As a follow-up to this communication, I write to confirm that almost all undergraduate classes during Summer Sessions I and II will be offered online only. Exceptions may be made in very rare cases; any courses offered on campus will be identified in the summer course listings. All faculty are being asked to prioritize moving online any courses that are required for graduation to ensure that you can continue progressing toward your degree in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>To prioritize the safety of our community by minimizing on-campus density, we are suspending all in-person undergraduate research projects. Undergraduate students may conduct their research virtually if the option is available, but cannot come to campus for research-related activities.</p>\n<p>The University Administration is continuing to examine our operations and procedures to ensure everyone’s health and safety. We are coordinating closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Governor’s Office, SUNY, and other key stakeholders. Please expect similar announcements in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\n<p>We all deeply appreciate your understanding and your willingness to adapt to these changing circumstances.</p>\n<p>Message regarding incivility in online classrooms</p>\n<p>March 31, 2020</p>\n<p>The University has issued a message to the community regarding incivility in online classrooms. Signed by Minghua Zhang, Interim Provost and Senior Vice-President for Academic Affairs; Judith Brown Clarke, Chief Diversity Officer; Richard J. Gatteau, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students; Charles L. Robbins, Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education and Student Success/Dean of the Undergraduate Colleges and Eric Wertheimer, Dean and Vice Provost of the Graduate School, the message reads as follows:</p>\n<p>Some of you have raised concerns about offensive and inappropriate content being shared in your Zoom classrooms. It is unfortunate that you have to deal with these issues, on top of leaving campus, taking classes online, and worrying about your health and that of your loved ones. Thank you for stepping forward. These occurrences are unacceptable and run counter to our core institutional values.</p>\n<p>Stony Brook University, like universities around the country, is actively working to address and prevent these instances of Zoom Intruding in our classes and meetings. We remain as committed as ever to maintaining an inclusive, welcoming, and respectful learning environment for all of our students, no matter the class format.</p>\n<p>You are a valued member of our diverse community. Our students, faculty, and staff represent all races, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, gender identities, and abilities -- and we benefit from all perspectives. We are committed to maintaining the dignity, respect, and fair treatment of all members of our community. Any action that stigmatizes an individual or a group of people, including expressions of xenophobia, will not be tolerated.</p>\n<p>The Code of Student Responsibility applies on and off campus. Any student who is found to behave inappropriately in these online platforms will be held accountable. If you have been targeted or experienced discrimination of any kind, including xenophobia, report these incidents to the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity .</p>\n<p>We have made significant and universal changes to Zoom accounts for all faculty and staff. These changes aim to prevent non-SBU individuals from joining classes and meetings, and they will have a minor impact on your Zoom experience:</p>\n<p>To join a class, you will have to log in using your SBU credentials</p>\n<p>Do not share Zoom links with others or post links on social media</p>\n<p>Only instructors will have the ability to share their screens; if you are expected to give a presentation, your instructor will give you access as needed</p>\n<p>Zoom classes are recorded. Offensive activities will be reviewed and addressed through our student conduct process.</p>\n<p>Faculty can also remove disruptive participants who are having a detrimental effect on the learning environment.</p>\n<p>We expect everyone to work together to keep our classrooms safe and productive. Most importantly, if something happens in one of your classes, please ReportIt . It is our goal to ensure a collaborative and respectful learning environment for all.</p>\n<p>PREVIOUS UPDATES</p>\n<p>Message to Graduate Students re: Summer Sessions ( April 4, 2020)</p>\n<p>Message to Faculty re: managing Zoom classroom disruptions ( April 3, 2020)</p>\n<p>Message from the Interim President re: Commencement 2020 ( April 2, 2020)</p>\n<p>Message from the Interim Provost re: changes to Summer Sessions ( April 2, 2002)</p>\n<p>Message regarding incivility in online classrooms ( March 31, 2020)</p>\n<p>Message from Dean of Students offering guidance as classes resume ( March 30, 2020)</p>\n<p>Office of the VP for Research Announces $500K in Seed Grants for COVID-19 Research ( March 30, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Interim President Expressing Gratitude ( March 27, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the VP for Research re: Research activities ( March 26, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Office of Procurement re: Revised policies ( March 25, 2020)</p>\n<p>Coronavirus Patient Triage Moves to South P Lot Testing Facility ( March 24, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Office of the Provost re: Spring semester grading policies ( March 23, 2020)</p>\n<p>From Student Affairs, et al. re: safety and notification procedures for resident students ( March 23, 2020)</p>\n<p>From Campus Dining re: policies and hours ( March 23, 2020)</p>\n<p>From SVP for Administration and Finance re: financial impact of remote learning ( March 23, 2020)</p>\n<p>From Human Resources re: COVID-19 Cases on Campus ( March 22, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the President re: COVID-19 Incidence at SBU ( March 21, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Office of Research re; Removal of Laboratory Items ( March 21, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the VP for Research re: Urgent Guidance on Research Activities ( March 20, 2020 )</p>\n<p>From the Office of the Provost re: Managing Transition to Remote Work ( March 20, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Office of the Provost re: Managing Transition to Remote Education ( March 20, 2020)</p>\n<p>From Stony Brook Medicine re: Coronavirus Testing ( March 20, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Dean of Students re: Residence, Commencement Issues ( March 19, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Office of the Vice President for Research re: laboratory-based research ( March 18, 2020 )</p>\n<p>From the President re: Strength through Adversity ( March 17, 2020)</p>\n<p>From Campus Residences re: Move-Out Requirement ( March 17, 2020)</p>\n<p>From VP for Human Resources re: COVID-19 Telephone Information Line ( March 16, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the President re: Spring Break Extended ( March 13, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Office of the Vice President for Research: Planning for disruptions of laboratory operations ( March 12, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Office of the Provost re: updated travel guidance ( March 12, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the President re: remote learning, coronavirus issues ( March 11, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the President re: Coronavirus planning ( March 11, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Dean of Students re: Precautionary Quarantine Initiative ( March 8, 2020, updated March 9, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Dean of Students re: Precautionary Quarantine Initiative ( March 6, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the President re: Adademic Preparations ( March 5, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the President re: Coronavirus Update ( March 4, 2020)</p>\n<p>SUNY guidance to be released ( March 3, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Provost re: Coronavirus Update ( March 2, 2020)</p>\n<p>From the Provost re: Travel to China ( January 31, 2020)</p>\n<p>This site last updated April 8, 2020.</p>","id":"89256f2f-0735-5d6d-9ce2-cb5ca14d933d","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-stonybrook/2020-04-10-14_02_42/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus Information"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CoronavirusUpdate-690x489-2-564x400.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Campus &#x26; Community</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Orange Community:</p>\n<p>Tomorrow we begin the final full month of the 2019-20 academic year. April is a month that traditionally goes by in the blink of an eye—occupied by end-of-year events, award ceremonies, a push to complete final projects, and efforts to secure jobs and internships. April is also the month that our grounds and facilities team accelerates its efforts to reveal the springtime beauty of the Syracuse University campus.</p>\n<p>It’s true that April 2020 will be experienced differently than previously planned by many in our community. However, that does not mean that our collective efforts to engage and connect our students, faculty and staff—and to celebrate their many achievements—won’t endure in the face of the COVID-19 crisis. As highlighted in this update, we’re working to engage the entrepreneurial spirit that has long defined our Orange family, to create new traditions and to enact innovative ways to build community and bridge the physical distance between us. Thanks to so many of you who have stepped up in this effort.</p>\n<p>Now to today’s updates.</p>\n<p>For University Community</p>\n<p>Community Assistance Portal: Syracuse University is committed to support the Central New York community as it responds to the COVID-19 health emergency. Faculty, staff and students are looking for ways to get involved and often are also being asked by others how the University can help. To that end, we have formalized a process to receive, prioritize and coordinate COVID-19 community assistance initiatives across the University. If you have an idea or would like to offer assistance to the community—or if you have been approached by a community member, organization or a governmental entity for assistance—please let us know by completing this newly created form. In response, a member of the Community Engagement team will follow up with you directly to discuss your idea, offer or request.</p>\n<p>Coming Together: If you haven’t already, please check out the University’s first “Orange Moments.” It’s a new weekly short video series featuring user-generated positive moments from the Orange community. You can see future “Orange Moments” on the University’s main Facebook and Twitter accounts. And visit the University home page, the Syracuse Stories page and the Syracuse University News website to see the latest stories about faculty, students and staff creating positive impact at the University and beyond.</p>\n<p>Preventing “Zoombombing:” While ITS recommends Blackboard Collaborate as the primary platform for synchronous classes and meetings, there also might be times when you use Zoom. Since there has been a large increase in Zoom meetings, internet trolls have been “Zoombombing” public meetings by sharing their screen and playing disturbing content. In an effort to combat this, Zoom has posted tips for preventing “Zoombombing.”</p>\n<p>Transportation Services: Due to decreased ridership, Parking and Transit Services, along with Centro, has determined to reduce services. The following transportation services are now being offered:</p>\n<p>Centro SU344, running between College Place and South Campus, will be the only on-campus Centro service available; other off-campus Centro services are still available.</p>\n<p>Free trolley shuttle service to Tops and Walgreens for students remaining on-campus will run daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., with the last trip from Tops and Walgreens at 7:24 p.m.</p>\n<p>Former Orange and Blue Trolley loops have transitioned to an on-demand service. For on-campus transportation requests, please call 315.706.5060. This service will be available weekdays from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m.</p>\n<p>Free shuttle service to the Regional Transportation Center and airport is available by calling 315.706.5060 at least one hour prior to the desired pick-up time.</p>\n<p>For all the latest shuttle information, visit syracuse.edu/about/campus-shuttle/.</p>\n<p>Hendricks Chapel: The chaplains and staff of Hendricks Chapel are available to provide religious and spiritual care and support for the campus community. For a list of services and programs being offered online by Chaplaincies, Religious Life Groups and the Office of the Dean, please visit the Hendricks Chapel online resources page or contact Alex Snow at adsnow@syr.edu. The weekly Sunday evening “Music and Message” series, featuring student performers and remarks from Dean Brian Konkol, will return on April 5. Those seeking to access the Hendricks Chapel Food Pantry may contact Syeisha Byrd at 315.706.4526 or smbyrd@syr.edu. For general information or questions, please contact chapel@syr.edu or 315.443.2901.</p>\n<p>For Students and Families</p>\n<p>Pass/Fail Deadline Friday, April 3: As a reminder, for the Spring 2020 semester only, undergraduate students are permitted to choose the pass/fail grading option for any courses in which they are registered, with the exception of University College online courses. The deadline for students to complete this action is Friday, April 3. To convert to the pass/fail grading option in any of your classes, please notify your academic advisor by email. Your advisor will work with the staff in your school or college, and the Office of the Registrar, to make the changes. For more information, please read Associate Provost Johnson’s full message.</p>\n<p>Housing and Meal Plan Refunds and Credits: As a reminder, Syracuse University will provide a prorated reimbursement of room and board payments to students who have left campus. The form to request refunds or credits went live on Friday, March 27, on the MySlice housing portal. We encourage students and families to continue to check the University’s refund webpage, as it is updated regularly with additional information and frequently asked questions.</p>\n<p>Financial Literacy Resources: The Office of Financial Literacy is offering virtual appointments with Smart Money Coaches, providing students with assistance related to understanding their current financial situation; helping to set goals; and discussing topics like credit cards and scores, banking, investment basics, and paychecks and taxes. To make an appointment, email the Office of Financial Literacy. The office has also compiled a list of emergency resources for students seeking support related to food and personal care items, payment options for student loans or credits cards, utilities and other expenses.</p>\n<p>Food and Groceries: As students continue to move from their North Campus residence halls to South Campus apartments, dining facilities will shift to meet demand. As all West Campus residence halls (BBB, Sadler and Lawrinson) are now closed, Sadler Dining Center is also closed. Shaw Dining Center and the Goldstein Food Court on South Campus remain open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day. For the most up-to-date information, please visit the Food Services website. Both the South Campus Express and West Campus Express convenience stores remain open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Students can also place an online grocery order from the Bookstore’s market and receive free on-campus delivery.</p>\n<p>South Campus Food Pantry: The South Campus Food Pantry at the Carriage House, located at 161 Farm Acre Road, next to the Skybarn, will be open on Tuesdays from noon to 4 p.m. and Thursdays from 3 to 7 p.m. to provide food and personal care items at no cost for students continuing to remain on or near campus through the remainder of the semester. In alignment with good health practices, students will be provided one bag at the pantry (please do not bring your own), and the pantry will be open to one user at a time. Parking is available outside the Carriage House or visit the Campus Shuttle schedule for other transportation options. Questions about the pantry may be directed to Syeisha Byrd.</p>\n<p>Free eBook Access: The Syracuse University Bookstore and its eBook partner, RedShelf, are teaming up to provide free eBook access to students.</p>\n<p>For Faculty and Staff</p>\n<p>Faculty/Staff Notification of COVID-19 Diagnosis: For reasons of prevention and public health, if you—or a faculty or staff member reporting to you (with their approval)—test positive for COVID-19, we ask that you please notify HR Shared Services at 315.443.4042. Such a notification will allow us to coordinate more expeditiously with the local public health authority (e.g. Onondaga County Health Department) and identify/notify other individuals who may have been exposed given the positive test of a co-worker. Any faculty or staff member who tests positive for COVID-19 should consult a physician related to the decision to return to work and provide evidence of that consultation (in the form of a physician’s note, etc.) to HR before resuming their duties.</p>\n<p>Carebridge Resources: We hope you’ll take advantage of our Faculty and Staff Assistance Program. Not only does Carebridge offer up to six free counseling sessions to benefits-eligible employees, but they have now made them easier to access with phone and video sessions. Eligible employees can call Carebridge at 800.437.0911 to use this benefit. Visit Carebridge offerings related to COVID-19 to explore services that may be relevant to you. And we encourage you to sign up for a new webinar: “Coronavirus and Your Finances” is this Friday, April 3, at noon. Experts will offer ideas on how to assess your situation, stretch every dollar and rebuild moving forward.</p>\n<p>Upcoming Wellness Opportunities: At a time when we are forced to be alone with ourselves or loved ones, and social distance from friends and family, it’s especially important to stay aware of and connected to our Faculty and Staff Wellness Initiative. Reach out to learn what you can do during these challenging times to best take care of your physical and emotional well-being by visiting wellness.syr.edu and subscribing to the mailing list. Many April programs are shifting to virtual offerings, including the next THRIVE! session on happiness and relationships April 28 or 30.</p>\n<p>Virtual Professional Development: Being cooped up can be a time to focus on your personal and career development. Why not spend the time enhancing or developing new business, technology-related and creative skills through expert-led course videos using LinkedIn Learning. Choose from more than 4,000 on-demand courses as diverse as communication, customer service, management, personal development, time management and mindfulness. Stay engaged, productive and looking toward the future. Visit linkedinlearning.syr.edu and log in using your NetID and password. The Office of Human Resources website has all the information you need to get started.</p>\n<p>Please continue to visit Syracuse.edu/coronavirus for the latest updates and do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions, concerns or issues you’d like to see addressed in these updates.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>J. Michael Haynie</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Strategic Initiatives and Innovation</p>","id":"17c5cf1d-d06a-5bc3-835a-60023b35a3c2","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-syr/2020-04-08-23_28_20/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus Update 3.31.20: Community Assistance Portal and Student, Faculty and Staff Resources"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CoronavirusUpdate-690x489-2-564x400.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Campus &#x26; Community</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Syracuse University Community:</p>\n<p>These are difficult days. At the same time, these difficult days represent an opportunity to demonstrate to each other and the world what it means to be and identify as a member of the Syracuse University community. In recent weeks, past, present and future generations of the Orange family have done just that and more.</p>\n<p>Our students have demonstrated incredible maturity, compassion, patience and flexibility in the face of a dramatically changed academic and collegiate experience. Our faculty have acted with purpose and in entrepreneurial ways to leverage their scholarly expertise to identify practical solutions for some of the most pressing issues facing our community while at the same time working to transition to online instruction and ensure our students are intellectually challenged. Our alumni continue to reach out to the University daily and ask only one question: “How can I help?” Even those who have yet to begin their Orange journey—those students [and their families] admitted to the Class of 2024—routinely compose and deliver messages of support and encouragement and empathy to our students, faculty and staff. This is what inspires us, and this is what motivates us. And all of this is what it means to be and identify as Syracuse Orange.</p>\n<p>Today’s updates include:</p>\n<p>For University Community</p>\n<p>University Ombuds: In response to social distancing restrictions, the Office of the University Ombuds has successfully moved its services to remote delivery, via video or phone appointments. This move allows the office to accommodate all individuals associated with Syracuse University. Appointments may be made by emailing Ombuds@syr.edu or calling 315.443.1087. In the past, the University Ombuds Office has been focused on faculty, staff and graduate students. However, during this unsettling time, University Ombuds Neal Powless is making his office’s services available to all those associated with Syracuse University, including undergraduates, until we return to residential operations.</p>\n<p>Commencement 2020: As a reminder, the Commencement 2020 survey is now live. Yesterday, Chancellor Syverud emailed all students scheduled to graduate in 2020 to solicit your input related to how Commencement 2020 should proceed. If you are a member of the 2020 graduating class and you have not yet completed the survey, I urge you to do so at your convenience. The deadline to complete the survey is Friday, April 3.</p>\n<p>For Students and Families</p>\n<p>Student Employment: On Thursday, Student Employment Services provided employers and student employees with further guidance related to student employment positions now that residential learning is suspended through the end of the semester. In an effort to continue providing students meaningful skill-building opportunities, as well as added income, employers are encouraged to provide their student employees with remote work where possible. We understand, though, that not all positions will have remote capabilities. As such, to support students during this time, including those who can no longer work in their student employment positions, the following guidance will be followed for student employment the remainder of the semester:</p>\n<p>Students who can work remotely are encouraged to do so and will be paid as usual, whether they hold Federal Work-Study (FWS) or non-FWS positions.</p>\n<p>Students with FWS awards and an active job who cannot work remotely will be paid based on normally scheduled hours, up to their full award, for the remainder of the semester through May 6.</p>\n<p>Students with non-FWS positions who cannot work remotely will be paid two weeks of wages, based on their scheduled weekly hours, to support them as they transition out of student employment.</p>\n<p>For additional information or questions, visit the Cuse Works website, call 315.443.2268 or email cuseworks@syr.edu.</p>\n<p>A Request: The risk posed by the COVID-19 virus is serious and a threat to human life. Recently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that many individuals infected by the virus were exposed by asymptomatic spread; that is, they were exposed to the virus by someone who was infected themselves but who did not exhibit symptoms and was likely unaware of their own infection. For this reason, we’re asking families and students to engage in a conversation about our collective responsibility to stay at home, practice social distancing, and engage in other appropriate health practices that protect public health and prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>While this important conversation is relevant to every family, we are uniquely concerned about those Syracuse University students who have returned to Syracuse and are currently residing in off-campus housing. We say this because University leaders and local government officials continue to receive reports suggesting that Syracuse University students (residing in Syracuse) are gathering in groups off campus and demonstrating disregard for social distancing practices. To our students’ families: this behavior puts your child and our community at risk.</p>\n<p>The suggestion that those aged 18 to 22 are somehow less impacted by the COVID-19 virus is false. Each day—in New York state and across the globe—healthy young people are hospitalized due to the virus. Some recover, but others do not. In addition, students residing in off-campus housing who choose not to abide by New York Health Department and Onondaga County Health Department directives—specifically to stay at home, practice social distancing and engage in other appropriate hygiene practices—may unknowingly transmit the virus to others in this community who are at high risk for severe complications stemming from COVID-19 infection. For those individuals and their families, the consequence of another’s disregard for social distancing could mean serious illness or even death.</p>\n<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo has directed all New York residents to stay at home and not to gather in large groups. The City of Syracuse, Onondaga County and the Syracuse University Department of Public Safety will enforce that order until further notice. That said, we hope that the threat of enforcement isn’t what motivates our students to adhere to these public health directives. Instead, we hope it is something more noble. We hope each member of the Orange family acknowledges and acts on the responsibility to safeguard their own health and to ensure that your neighbors, friends—and those who are their neighbors and friends—remain safe, healthy and protected throughout this crisis</p>\n<p>We urge all families—and especially the families of students who have remained in Syracuse—to discuss with your student our shared civic responsibility in response to the COVID-19 emergency.</p>\n<p>Virtual Health and Wellness Resources: The Barnes Center at The Arch has implemented additional virtual resources and services to promote mindfulness, connection, healthy activity and involvement:</p>\n<p>Sanvello Mobile App—At this time, Sanvello has extended free premium stress, anxiety and depression management services to the global community.</p>\n<p>Esports Virtual Tournaments—Until Friday, May 8, the Barnes Center will host virtual esports tournaments. Including Fortnite, students have six different free tournament options.</p>\n<p>Virtual Drop-In Fitness Classes—The first in a series of virtual drop-in fitness classes is now available on the Wellness Portal. New videos will be introduced throughout the semester.</p>\n<p>Cuse Fit Chat—Through personalized free video meetings, Cuse Fit Chat connects students with Barnes Center personal trainers and resources to help meet wellness goals. To learn more and to sign up for a meeting, visit the Wellness Portal.</p>\n<p>Wellness Leadership Virtual Workshops—Starting Wednesday, April 1, pre-registration will be available in the Wellness Portal. With more than 18 options, individuals can attend a virtual workshop within each dimension of health and wellness to earn a graduation medallion, certificate and a Be Well sweatshirt. Drop-ins are welcome.</p>\n<p>Virtual SoulTalk Groups—Starting Thursday, April 2, and hosted each Thursday throughout April, students are invited to participate in the virtual SoulTalk series. SoulTalk each week has a new theme surrounding life’s big questions, such as purpose and connection.

This new policy is intended to provide flexibility for any faculty member impacted by the current COVID-19 health crisis. To learn more about the temporary policy, please read Provost Liu’s full message.</p>\n<p>Tracking COVID-19 Expenses: Yesterday, a message was distributed from Gwenn Judge, director of the Office of Budget and Planning, to deans, directors and department heads and University budget system users, asking all areas to track any expense being incurred due to COVID-19. A MyCode has been established for Universitywide use for COVID-19 expenses incurred directly for University mission/business purposes: 609722. These are non-standard expenses occurring to maintain continuity of our mission (e.g., support online instruction or relocation of students). An additional MyCode has been established for expenses pertaining to non-mission/business purposes or external community use (including donations): 600600. These are the costs associated with supporting the local community or orders from a government entity (e.g., the purchase of materials to make masks for local hospitals or use of University facilities for public quarantine or hospital purposes).</p>\n<p>Please continue to stay safe and be well.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>J.

We understand that students and families have questions and concerns. Please know, we are working with urgency to address them.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, we want you to know that if you were unable to move your belongings out of your campus residence by March 22, the amount of your refund or credit will not be affected. No matter what date you are able to clear your room and/or apartment of belongings, you will still be eligible for a housing and meal plan refund or credit prorated to March 23, 2020, the date that the University discontinued residential instruction, and you may apply beginning on March 27.</p>\n<p>A refund or credit will be processed once students have removed their belongings from their on-campus residence hall or apartment and turned in their keys. A routine room inspection will be completed, and then the refund or credit will be issued.</p>\n<p>Currently, New York state is under an executive order from Governor Andrew Cuomo that forbids any non-essential travel, and no students or families are allowed to clear out their residence hall room or apartment at this time. We will offer additional opportunities to return to campus only when federal, state and local health officials have deemed it safe to do so.</p>\n<p>Outlined below are answers to some of the most common questions we have received from students, parents and families:</p>\n<p>How do I apply for my refund or credit?</p>\n<p>On Friday, March 27, at noon, a form will be available on the MySlice Housing portal that will allow students to request their refunds or credits.</p>\n<p>I was unable to travel to Syracuse University and move my belongings out by March 22. Will I be eligible for a refund or credit?</p>\n<p>Yes. If you were unable to move your belongings out of campus housing by March 22, the amount of your refund or credit will not be affected in any way. You will still be eligible for a refund or credit prorated to March 23, 2020, and can apply beginning on March 27.</p>\n<p>What conditions need to be met before I receive my refund or credit?</p>\n<p>Students will need to have removed their belongings from their on-campus residence hall or apartment and turned in their keys to the Office of Student Living. A routine room inspection will be completed, and then the refund or credit will be issued. No matter what date these conditions are met, all refunds or credits will be prorated to March 23, 2020.</p>\n<p>I have completely moved out of University housing and forgot to return my key, or I plan to have a shipping company pack up my belongings for me and do not plan to return to campus. How can I turn in my key in order to meet the conditions for the refund or credit?</p>\n<p>If this is the case, you should return your key by mail to the University. North Campus students vacating a residence hall should mail their keys, along with their name, SU I.D. number and hall/room number to the Office of Student Living at 111 Waverly Ave., Syracuse, NY 13244. South Campus students vacating an apartment should mail their keys, along with their name, SU I.D. number and apartment number to the Housing Office, 401 Skytop Road, Syracuse, NY 13244. We suggest using a tracking number when mailing your key back to campus.</p>\n<p>What if I currently have an outstanding balance on my Bursar account? Will I still receive a credit or refund?</p>\n<p>To the extent there is an outstanding balance due on a student’s bursar account, the adjustment would be applied toward the balance first, before a refund is issued.</p>\n<p>I vacated my campus residence before spring break. Can I receive a larger refund or credit because of those extra days?</p>\n<p>No. The University will prorate credits or refunds from March 23, 2020, the date that residential instruction was discontinued.</p>\n<p>Will you refund or credit my fees?</p>\n<p>Once you have met the conditions to receive the housing and meal plan refund or credit, the residential internet and cable access services fee will also be refunded or credited to your Bursar account, following the same proration basis used for the Housing adjustment. There will be no refund or credit for mandatory fees paid in Spring 2020, such as the health and wellness, activity or co-curricular fee, as is consistent with the University’s Tuition, Fees, and Related Policies bulletin.</p>\n<p>Will you refund or credit my parking fees?</p>\n<p>Yes. Please mail your parking pass and other devices (such as garage openers and swipe cards) to the Parking Office and then submit an email to parkmail@syr.edu that includes your SU I.D. number and contact information. Once those have been received, the Office of Parking and Transit Services will process a parking refund or credit prorated to March 23, 2020.</p>\n<p>I am an upperclassman. I do not plan to live in University housing next year and will not need a meal plan. Instead of receiving a housing or meal plan credit, can I get a refund?</p>\n<p>If you do not plan on living in University housing or purchasing a University meal plan, these credits will be applied to tuition, fees or any other billed charges on your Bursar account.</p>\n<p>I have requested to remain in University housing beyond March 22, 2020. Will you prorate the refunds or credits differently based on how long I stay?</p>\n<p>If you have requested to stay in University housing beyond March 22, your refund or credit will be prorated based on when you vacate your room or apartment. If you move from North Campus to South Campus, there will be no change to your room and board charges.</p>\n<p>I plan on studying abroad next semester. Do I still qualify for the housing credit? If so, how do I apply it to my study abroad room and board costs?</p>\n<p>Yes. Your credit will be added to your Bursar account, and that credit can be applied to any charges on your account, including those for studying abroad.</p>\n<p>I plan on transferring from Syracuse University and will not return to residential housing or need a meal plan. How do I request a refund?</p>\n<p>You should fill out the form on MySlice to request a refund, and it will be issued once your confirmation of transfer is received by the Syracuse University Bursar’s Office.</p>\n<p>I do not want my meal plan credit to be in the form of SUpercard food money. Can you give me a refund on my meal plan instead?</p>\n<p>We have heard from many students and parents on this issue and are working to adjust this process. If your prorated meal plan credit is less than $1,000, we will add that money to your SUpercard food balance, and you will have until the end of Spring 2021 to use it. If your prorated meal plan credit is more than $1,000, you can request that any amount above $1,000 be credited to your Bursar account.</p>\n<p>How will I receive credit for my remaining SUpercard PLUS funds?</p>\n<p>There is no need to request this money. We will follow our typical procedure and credit student accounts the day after the semester ends. Any remaining PLUS funds on your account will be transferred to your Bursar account on May 11, 2020.</p>\n<p>I appreciate all the students and families who took the time to reach out to our office. I am hopeful that we have addressed the majority of your questions. However, we will continue to work through outstanding issues and communicate with you when there is more information to share.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Syracuse University’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, please visit Syracuse.edu/coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Stay safe, be well and take care.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jennifer L.

It’s one our graduating students have worked tirelessly toward and one they’ve looked forward to cherishing with family and friends who helped them achieve this accomplishment. That is why I promised our 2020 graduates they would have a Commencement and would have an opportunity to influence the shape of this important event.</p>\n<p>After hearing from thousands of our students, I am pleased to share with you that this fall we will hold our 2020 Commencement in our stadium, after the roof replacement project is complete and once health officials advise large gatherings are once again safe. Graduating students overwhelmingly selected this option. It will be one of the first events held in this space. I promise you, we will make it special, meaningful and memorable. Our graduating students have earned it.</p>\n<p>As planning efforts get underway, I want to provide our graduating students with the reassurance of how their Commencement and other Commencement-related activities, including schools/college convocations, will move forward. I assure you that, as soon as we are able to finalize plans, we will share the details with you. In the meantime, here are three important dates to mark on your calendars:</p>\n<p>On April 13, you will receive specific information about how degrees will be conferred.</p>\n<p>On May 10, I will formally confer upon graduating students the academic degrees that have been approved by our Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p>By June 1, I anticipate being able to share more details about the fall Commencement.</p>\n<p>I appreciate the tremendous patience, understanding and flexibility our graduating students have demonstrated throughout this challenging time. And I look forward to marking your graduation with the ceremony and celebration that you deserve.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Chancellor Kent Syverud</p>","id":"19b0b2bb-ac48-5015-83bd-ee4cf710b273","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-syr/2020-04-10-14_00_37/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Commencement 2020 Update from Chancellor Syverud"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CoronavirusUpdate-690x489-2-564x400.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Campus &#x26; Community</p>\n<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>\n<p>Over the past month our community has experienced unprecedented uncertainty. As Syracuse University confronts the rapidly evolving COVID-19 health emergency, our decisions and actions are informed daily by new information, policy guidance and public health research—some of which is ongoing right here at Syracuse University.</p>\n<p>Given the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 health emergency, by necessity it’s often the case that the decisions and actions we take—in response to new information and local, state and federal policy guidance—must be contemplated and implemented decisively and expeditiously. One consequence of that decision-making reality is to sometimes compound the uncertainty and anxiety many of you are experiencing. This is understandable. It is also, however, why we will remain committed to frequent and authentic communications related to the University’s efforts to safeguard the health and safety of our community, and also concerning those actions we take to ensure the continuity of our academic mission throughout the COVID-19 health emergency. In this time when certainty is in short supply, please know that we will continue to communicate regularly and often.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, today’s updates include:</p>\n<p>For University Community</p>\n<p>Campus/Building Access: Social distancing is perhaps our best tool in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Many of us are frustrated by the professional and social isolation stemming from the fact that we can’t visit places and see people as we had in the past. I appreciate this situation and acknowledge that it will continue to be a challenge for the foreseeable future. That said, I want to remind everyone of the social distancing expectations on our campus. At this time, only individuals who have been deemed essential personnel should be accessing buildings and facilities on our campus. Additionally, access to laboratories is limited to those engaging in essential research activity, including the maintenance of live animals and plants, microbes, cell lines and essential equipment and materials, along with any research related to COVID-19. To learn more about the research guidance and restrictions, please visit the COVID-19 Guidance for Researchers page.</p>\n<p>South Campus Food Pantry Open and Accepting Support: The South Campus Food Pantry at the Carriage House remains accessible to all students. If you would like to join in supporting the pantry, visit givetosu.syr.edu/FoodPantry to contribute financial support. You can also send food directly by visiting the pantry’s Amazon wish list. Your purchased items will be shipped directly to South Campus. You can also drop off non-perishable and perishable items and toiletries at the pantry. To arrange dropoffs, contact Syeisha Byrd at 315.706.4526 or smbyrd@syr.edu.</p>\n<p>Hendricks Chapel: Hendricks Chapel chaplains and staff continue to provide religious and spiritual care and support. For a list of services and programs being offered online by chaplaincies, including new information on Passover, Ramadan and Holy Week, please visit the Hendricks Chapel online resources page or contact Alex Snow at adsnow@syr.edu. As a reminder, “Music and Message,” featuring student performers and spoken reflections, will be streamed online at 4 p.m. Sunday, April 5. For general information or questions, please contact chapel@syr.edu or 315.443.2901.</p>\n<p>Mental Health Resources: In the second of a series of three special “ADA Live!” podcasts, Debbie Plotnick of Mental Health America (MHA) discusses resources available for people who may feel isolated, medical professionals and caregivers. She also talks about policy initiatives championed by MHA. The episode will be available Wednesday, April 8, at 1 p.m. on SoundCloud ADA Live! and on the ADA Live! website. An interactive transcript and text version are also provided. “ADA Live!” is a free online program of the Southeast ADA Center, a project of the Burton Blatt Institute at Syracuse University.</p>\n<p>Resources for Working Remotely: As Syracuse University students, faculty and staff adjust to the online environment, we want to remind you of the Working &#x26; Teaching Remotely and Academic Continuity Resources pages on Answers. These resources cover a range of topics, including remote access, web conferencing tools and file management solutions. We will continue to update these resources over time and as suggested by users.</p>\n<p>For Students and Families</p>\n<p>Virtual Engagement Opportunities: As we adjust to our new normal, Syracuse University is leveraging its spirit of innovation and creativity to create a virtual Orange community and a set of events and experiences that bring our students together, even while they’re apart. As Chancellor Kent Syverud noted, we have added a virtual events category to the University Events Calendar, where you can find ways to stay connected outside of regular classes. This weekend, you can join Orange fans near and far online for a Facebook Live virtual watch party to relive the excitement of the 2003 NCAA men’s basketball championship game between Syracuse and Kansas. We also are working hard each day to expand virtual services to our students including Career Services, International Student Services, Cultural Centers, the Center for Learning and Student Success and in our colleges and schools.</p>\n<p>Expanded Grocery and Convenience Offerings: The South Campus Express convenience store has expanded its product offerings in response to student requests. The store, which is open every day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., is receiving regular shipments and carries a variety of grocery and snack items. The Syracuse University Bookstore continues to add new items to its online market, and free on-campus delivery is available every Tuesday and Thursday.</p>\n<p>Sexual and Relationship Violence Services and Reporting: Whether students are on or off campus during this time, the Sexual and Relationship Violence Response (SRVR) Team at the Barnes Center at The Arch is still available 24/7 for students impacted by sexual and relationship violence. Students can receive confidential support, advocacy, safety planning and discussion of reporting options through the SRVR Team by calling 315.443.8000. The Dean of Students Office (not confidential) also remains available for support at dos@syr.edu or 315.443.4357. The Office of Equal Opportunity, Inclusion and Resolution Services (EOIRS) continues to provide support and resources to students, faculty and staff on issues related to sexual misconduct, Title IX and discrimination. Students, faculty and staff can reach EOIRS or file reports by contacting 315.443.4018 or equalopp@syr.edu.</p>\n<p>For Faculty and Staff</p>\n<p>Transforming COVID into a Learning Opportunity: The COVID outbreak is disrupting teaching and learning in many ways, and such disruption can provide incredible learning opportunities. Educating students about COVID-19 may help them to deal with the challenges of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Online Learning Environment Support: In preparation of end-of-semester planning, faculty members are encouraged to reach out to the Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence (CTLE), the Center for Online and Digital Learning and Information Technology Services for support related to topics such as engaging online learners, reworking an exam for the online environment or transforming capstone projects to virtual experiences. The CTLE will provide consultations for the pedagogies and course plans and can be reached at CTLE@syr.edu. Faculty can also contact help@syr.edu for assistance.</p>\n<p>Support for Summer Course Development: To help our students continue their work toward degree completion in this time of uncertainty, University College (UC) is working with schools and colleges to expand the online summer course catalog with additional eight-week summer courses that begin on July 6 and end on Aug. 27. UC has dedicated funding to support faculty to develop online courses for this eight-week summer session. The Center for Online and Digital Learning will work with faculty on course design, development and production. Interested faculty should contact Ryan Williams, associate dean for academic affairs at UC, for more information about funding and support.</p>\n<p>Wellness Resources and Opportunities: The recent Wellness Initiative email to faculty and staff highlights upcoming virtual wellness programs, the opportunity to recognize a colleague with a shoutout, Carebridge webinars relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic and more. Faculty and staff are encouraged to remain aware of and engage in Wellness Initiative offerings as their schedules allow.</p>\n<p>Expanded Telemedicine Coverage through MDLIVE: As of April 1, faculty and staff enrolled in the University’s medical plans have access to MDLIVE, a national telemedicine provider that gives patients 24/7 access to a network of board-certified doctors and licensed therapists for non-emergency health concerns. Additional information on MDLIVE can be found here.</p>\n<p>Finally, I’d like to conclude this update with a public acknowledgement of the many individuals—staff and faculty here on campus and abroad—who over the last several weeks have worked tirelessly to “bring home” hundreds of Syracuse University students who were studying overseas when COVID-19 began its global spread. We are beyond thrilled to report that as of April 1, all Syracuse University students studying abroad who desired to return to the U.S. have done so safely. Faculty and staff affiliated with our abroad programs not only monitored and supported students throughout this process, but also followed up with each individual student to confirm they arrived safely to their destination. This was a Herculean effort, executed with purpose and empathy. On behalf of those students, their parents and the entire University, I want to extend deep appreciation and gratitude to those who stepped up in remarkable ways in support of these students and families.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>J.

He did not order a state-wide shelter in place of residence to allow counties the option to do so on a county-by-county basis.</p>\n<p>Given that Dallas and McLennan Counties have announced their own shelter in place of residence orders, and others may follow suit very soon, all students may want to consider returning to their family home residences. For those in need of housing, you may remain in on-campus housing and should be prepared to shelter in place if the order follows for our College Station and/or Galveston campuses. We will of course continue dining take-out, medical and other essential services, and academic affairs support has already moved online.</p>\n<p>On-campus students choosing to depart may utilize an “Express Check-Out” option with Residence Life to allow for an orderly move of belongings. Students who have been dwelling in their family homes but retained on-campus housing and wish to check out may also coordinate with Residence Life on arranging to pick up their belongings at some point this semester.</p>\n<p>The Texas A&#x26;M System is reviewing dining and housing credit or refund options and will provide guidance in the very near future.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding as we do all we can to support Aggies, especially those who may not have other housing and dining options.</p>\n<p>Michael K.

Other senior university leaders and myself appreciated the engagement and opportunity to address what is on your minds as we were “social distanced” across multiple studios at KAMU and another building!</p>\n<p>As we continue to respond to new updates, I want to assure you that our top priority is your health and safety. Thanks to the heroic efforts of our faculty and staff, we have made major adjustments to bring everything online, greatly reducing the risk you face during this historic pandemic. For those who needed to return to our campuses, we have taken extensive measures to ensure your safety, with some buildings offering monitors to promote social distancing and all of our facilities providing enhanced procedures to promote public health.</p>\n<p>As new developments emerge, please visit the TAMU Central COVID-19 Website for coronavirus-related updates across a wide range of relevant topics.</p>\n<p>Campus remains open, but with classes moving online many of you have decided to stay home. To that end, all of our academic and support services are, to the extent possible, available virtually. I encourage you to visit the Keep Learning site for ongoing updates.</p>\n<p>For those of you who have decided to stay on campus, we will continue to provide essential services such as grab-and-go dining. Bus transportation will be available on campus, with limited passengers to ensure social distancing. Campus ATMs remain in operation.

For students expected to enter college in Fall 2021, the suspension of SAT and ACT testing due to COVID-19 has created additional complications, and the university is making accommodations to address these challenges. </p>\n<p>“We understand the uncertainties high school juniors are currently facing,” HeathEinstein, TCU’s dean of admission, said. “Campus visits are now virtual, the ACT and SAT testing dates are shifting and it has heightened the already high stress these students are facing. TCU wants to do what we can to reduce some of the anxiety, so that students may focus on their safety and successfully shift to a new educational modality.” </p>\n<p>With the policy shift, prospective students may decide for themselves whether they wish to include standardized test scores with their application. Students should consider their academic record in addition to their co-curricular experiences when making their decision on whether to include test scores. Other factors considered in the admission process are curriculum rigor, essays, and contributions to school and community. </p>\n<p>“TCU has never relied solely on one factor in admission decisions, and that will be reinforced while we are suspending the testing requirement,” Einstein said. “We have always believed that while standardized tests provide some useful information, there is more to a student’s record that indicates how they would contribute in and out of the classroom at TCU. The qualities that matter most to us – personal character and the ability to meaningfully engage with the community – can’t be found by looking at a test score.”</p>\n<p>TCU will continue its policy to allow applicants to self-report test scores through the online admission portal.

We are fortunate to have an uncommonly accomplished, tight-knit and caring community—one whose members support each other in times of need and celebrate each other in times of success.</p>\n<p>This is certainly true of those who will graduate from all of our schools this year. By virtue of their hard work, commitment and contributions to our university, they have enriched the Tufts community as students and will continue to do so as alumni. In lecture halls, laboratories, studios, clinics, and hospitals, and through service work in communities close to our campuses and across the world, they have made their mark. This year’s graduates are as vibrant and vital to Tufts as the members of the 163 classes that have preceded them.</p>\n<p>In light of the unprecedented public health crisis we are currently facing, we will be unable to bring our graduates together physically to celebrate all that they have accomplished. Though we unfortunately cannot be together in person, we will celebrate the class of 2020 on May 17 with the university’s first virtual Commencement ceremony. We intend to create an inspiring event that draws on beloved traditions, and perhaps starts some new ones.</p>\n<p>We are now working to design a unique and participatory virtual experience that will capture the spirit, positivity and fun of a traditional commencement ceremony for graduates, their families, alumni, and the entire Tufts community. We hope you will join us in thinking about how to create an impactful and memorable event. Please follow this link to share your ideas for the ceremony. We are a resilient and imaginative community. I’m confident we will make this a celebration to remember.</p>\n<p>Please watch your inbox for additional news as planning progresses and for information about any school-specific Commencement celebrations.</p>\n<p>I want to assure all of you that even in this challenging time, the light on the hill still shines brightly.</p>\n<p>I sincerely wish good health to you, your families, and your loved ones.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Tony Monaco</p>","id":"b6f962d4-5d98-5d43-b57f-d710e258d635","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-tufts/2020-04-08-23_45_00/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tufts University Commencement 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://coronavirus.tufts.edu/wp-content/themes/jumbopress-base/assets/images/favicon_tufts.png\"></p>\n<p>March 25, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Tufts admitted students,</p>\n<p>I am writing to congratulate you on your admission to Tufts University.

While I cannot predict the course and impact of the COVID-19 virus over the next weeks and months, I can say with certainty that Tufts is committed to continuing the education of both its current and prospective students throughout the crisis and offering the highest-quality courses and support you will need to begin your program. I am very hopeful that we will be able to greet you in person, but if you are an international student and unable to enter the country, if you are a student who cannot travel to campus for other reasons, or if the campus needs to be closed to in-person instruction, please be assured that Tufts University, together with all its schools, is committed to providing access to education until the campus can be fully reopened and travel is restored.</p>\n<p>Given the unprecedented events we are facing, we will be regularly evaluating circumstances that may require us to make changes, and we will endeavor to provide timely updates to you and the rest of our community. I encourage you to monitor go.tufts.edu.coronavirus for the latest information.</p>\n<p>I view our response to COVID-19 as directly related to the mission of the university. Tufts is a world-class institution with a long-standing commitment to engaging with the community, both local and global, in an effort to build a healthier, safer, and more equitable world. Here at Tufts, we fully understand that the crisis brought on by the Coronavirus carries with it an obligation to such a commitment. Tufts President Monaco has taken a leadership role in this engagement, and we are extremely proud of our students who, together with others, have come together to repair more than 6,000 N-95 masks for immediate use by Tufts Medical Center. You can read the full story here: <a href=\"https://now.tufts.edu/articles/team-comes-together-repair-thousands-n-95-masks\">https://now.tufts.edu/articles/team-comes-together-repair-thousands-n-95-masks</a>.</p>\n<p>The most important part of our community is our students, and I want to again reassure you that we have already developed the tools and courses we will need to provide you with an exceptional education. Along with my faculty colleagues, our deans, and President Monaco, I am fully dedicated to supporting Tufts’ ability to play a leading role in this challenging time, with our highest priority being the education of our students while further nurturing their own dedication to solving some of the greatest challenges facing today’s world.</p>\n<p>If you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact the admissions office of the school within Tufts to which you have been accepted. For our international students, the Tufts International Center is committed to supporting you as you prepare to come to Tufts and can answer any questions you may have.</p>\n<p>Once again, I want to express my warmest congratulations to you and hope we will see you in the new academic year.

As you may have seen from Executive Vice President Mike Howard’s recent email, the university is taking additional measures to continue to reduce the number of community members on our campuses with the purpose of increasing social distancing and protecting ourselves and the broader community from the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>To this end, the university has asked all non-essential staff to work from home effective Tuesday, March 17th. We are writing to confirm that this policy applies to master’s and graduate certificate students, doctoral students, and postdoctoral scholars ( and not to clinical certificate students/residents ), most of whom engage in learning and/or work that have not been identified by their advisors and supervisors as essential to the university’s operational and/or academic continuity. As a result, most master’s and graduate certificate students, doctoral students, and postdoctoral scholars will be expected to work from home or their residence hall effective immediately and no later than Friday, March 20th. Moreover, all students will take their courses remotely as all courses in all schools have been, or soon will be, converted to a remote format.</p>\n<p>An email has also been sent to all faculty by Provost Nadine Aubry, Vice Provost Kevin Dunn, and Tufts University Faculty Senate President Melissa Mazan to encourage faculty to work remotely unless their work is deemed essential to the university’s operational and/or academic continuity (e.g., clinical activities).</p>\n<p>If you have not yet discussed your status with your advisor/PI/supervisor, please do so now so that you may take the necessary steps to work remotely, or to focus your time on campus attending to essential matters in a manner that observes social distancing and current CDC guidelines, and the evolving state and federal requirements. Please minimize your travel on your campus or between campuses, and be in touch with your advisor/PI/supervisor with any questions you may have about your university responsibilities at this time. For those of you who do not work directly with an advisor/PI/supervisor please direct all questions you may have to your school’s Office of Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>Individuals whose supervisors have determined that they are not essential to the university’s operational and/or academic continuity must work with their PI/supervisor to identify tasks that can be completed remotely. Suggested activities are as follows:</p>\n<p>Continuing to conduct research that does not require your presence in physical facilities or experimental laboratories remotely</p>\n<p>Writing papers, thesis chapters and grant proposals</p>\n<p>Conducting a literature survey</p>\n<p>Reviewing articles</p>\n<p>Conducting analyses on your experimental data</p>\n<p>Compiling data and/or synthesizing research.</p>\n<p>Doctoral thesis proposals and thesis defenses can be carried out virtually during this time. Each school’s Office of Student Affairs can assist in arranging these activities where necessary.</p>\n<p>The International Center has confirmed that there will be no immediate term change in visa status for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars on a visa while education and research/scholarship activities continue remotely. The International Center will continue to monitor developments and advise departments and visa holders as the situation continues to unfold.</p>\n<p>Please monitor and refer to specific guidance from your school/center.

The rapid spread of this virus has caused communities worldwide to reimagine themselves socially, economically and personally. As we at Tulane temporarily change how we interact with one another, we must also ensure that we come out of this crisis stronger and better prepared for future challenges. And, I firmly believe, we will emerge from these trying times a more resilient and wiser Tulane.</p>\n<p>We are rapidly implementing changes in how we operate so we can successfully continue our academic, research and operational missions. Over the past weekend and during the next week, most of our students will return to their hometowns for the remainder of the spring semester. We are very much going to miss engaging with our students face to face and seeing them on the quads, in the residence halls and throughout our campuses. They are the heart and soul of Tulane. Effective this morning, we have also implemented very flexible work arrangements for staff to further reduce the population on campuses. Even though our campuses are becoming quieter places, we are still here to support our faculty, staff and students. In fact, this crisis has only increased our commitment to all Tulanians – wherever they may be.</p>\n<p>By next Monday, March 23rd, only 400 students will be remaining in our on-campus residence halls. It was important to allow students who could not return home to have a place to stay on campus. With the exception of certain clinical classes, our entire community will be engaged in an online format, rather than face to face. While the Tulane community has no known cases of COVID-19, these disruptive shifts are necessary for us to do our part in protecting our community and the public’s health during this pandemic.</p>\n<p>These past weeks have been a challenging time for our community, but we have proven again and again that the bonds that hold us together are stronger than any threat we face. We will continue to keep you updated through many means of communication, including my video series. Again, rest assured that we will come through this a better and stronger global community and a better and stronger Tulane. Thank you for your flexibility, spirit and grit.</p>\n<p>With much admiration,</p>\n<p>Mike</p>","id":"08c02ab8-e26b-551b-ad3b-c2fb7a7c2b88","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-tulane/2020-04-08-23_45_39/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Message from President Fitts: A Better and Stronger Tulane"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://tulane.edu/sites/all/themes/tulane/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png\"></p>\n<p>March 15, 2020</p>\n<p>To all Tulane Students,</p>\n<p>This has been a busy weekend, with so many of our students organizing their things in preparation for leaving campus. I know that especially for those who are heading home, these past few days have been filled with classes, tests, packing, saying goodbye to close friends, and, tragically, mourning the loss of a classmate. Please know that we are still here for you and you can and should reach out to the appropriate faculty and staff if there is anything we can do to support your success, and we will continue to reach out to you throughout the semester and do our best to sustain our deep sense of community even at a distance. And while we will try to limit the surprises from here on out, this is new territory for Tulane and for higher ed, so we remain committed to responding to questions, addressing concerns and evolving our work in response to the latest information.</p>\n<p>I am writing at this point to share with you the new academic calendar for the remainder of this semester. In most regards it is identical to the past calendar, but I want to call your attention to the two main differences.</p>\n<p>First, and this should come as no surprise, the calendar indicates that there will be no classes during the week of March 16-22.</p>\n<p>The remainder of this message will be dedicated to explaining the second set of changes. With the cancellation of classes the week of March 16, our 3 credit hour classes fall short of the number of contact hours required in order to award 3 credit hours. As a result, for each such class, each instructor has been asked to add at least another 50 minutes of contact time in addition to the standard meeting times for the remainder of the semester. (More on that in a moment.) Instructors may choose to add up to three hours to compensate for the lost week. The exception to this rule is for classes that meet only on Mondays. The quirks of this year’s calendar now show them falling a full week short of the required contact time, so they must make up the equivalent of one week. That is, if there is a three credit course which meets for three hours every Monday afternoon, then the instructor must add 3 contact hours in addition to the standard meeting times over the remainder of the semester.</p>\n<p>For each class, we have designated some make-up times. Your instructor may not need to use these times, but they are set aside to ensure that there is a viable option.</p>\n<p>The weekend of March 28 and 29 has been designated as the make-up weekend for all Monday/Wednesday/Friday classes. Your designated time is the same as your standard class meeting time. That is, if your class is MWF from 10-11 a.m., then your designated make-up hours are Saturday, March 28 from 10-11 a.m. or Sunday March 29 from 10-11 a.m., and you should make sure that you are available to attend class during these times. (Because you cannot be registered for two classes each of which meets MWF at 10 a.m., this system guarantees that no one will be registered for two classes with overlapping make-up times.)</p>\n<p>The weekend of April 18-19 is the designated make-up period for classes that meet Tuesdays and Thursdays, so that if your class meets TTh from 8:30-10 a.m., then the designated make-up hours for that class are Saturday, April 18 from 8:30-10 a.m. or Sunday April 19 from 8:30-10 a.m.</p>\n<p>Wednesday April 29 is the designated make-up day for classes which meet only on Monday, so that if a class meets Monday afternoons from 2-5 p.m., the designated make-up time is Wednesday April 29 from 2-5 p.m.</p>\n<p>If your instructor chooses to meet (virtually) during one of these periods, you will be required to attend. In addition to the make-up time, your instructor may revise the syllabus in other ways in response to the transition to remote teaching, or perhaps in response to the global health crisis underway. A new syllabus should be given to you shortly after the class resumes in a week that will clarify the extra meeting times and any other changes to the syllabus.</p>\n<p>Please note that while I have been referring to \"contact hours,\" they need not be only in the form of synchronous meetings (i.e. when everyone logs in at the same time for an online lecture or discussion). Your instructor may combine these synchronous meetings with additional videos, discussion forums, projects and papers to create a set of experiences which together best achieve the educational goals for the class. These next several weeks will be a fascinating, and challenging, educational journey for both faculty and student, and I thank you for your flexibility and support as we all find our way in this temporary new normal.</p>\n<p>For any questions about specific courses or other academic events please contact the instructor for more information. For other questions, please feel free to contact the university registrar, Colette Raphel, who will coordinate with others as needed to provide appropriate information and guidance.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Robin Forman</p>\n<p>Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>","id":"8da5c129-ae14-503e-87df-e1df9668057a","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-tulane/2020-04-08-23_45_43/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Revised Academic Calendar"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://tulane.edu/sites/all/themes/tulane/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png\"></p>\n<p>March 11, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Tulane Community:</p>\n<p>As you know, our country and world are currently facing a severe health crisis with the global outbreak of COVID-19. For weeks, Tulane has been mounting a response to this threat with the goal of keeping our campus community safe while also allowing our students to continue their education.</p>\n<p>I write to you today to outline a series of major actions we are taking in response to this pandemic. In keeping with the recommendations of public health officials worldwide, we are acting to reduce the concentration of people on campus and the number of gatherings. These efforts include, as outlined in this letter, conducting classes online, reducing the number of students on campus, cancelling major events and eliminating non-essential travel. However, our campuses will remain open during this period as we continue to support the academic and research mission of Tulane.</p>\n<p>Instruction</p>\n<p>All classes will be conducted online beginning Monday, March 23 through the end of the semester.</p>\n<p>Friday, March 13 is the last day of in-person classes for the semester.</p>\n<p>No classes, online or in-person, will be taught March 14-22. This will allow undergraduate students time to move and will also ensure that faculty can provide students with the highest quality of online instruction.</p>\n<p>All graduate and professional students will also transition to remote instruction by March 23, with the exception of clinical-based programs, practicums, medical rotations and in-lab training/research.</p>\n<p>We will observe Spring Break as scheduled so there will be no classes from Sunday, April 5 to Monday, April 13.

The other cases in the state are in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</p>\n<p>UC Davis and UC Davis Health remained vigilant, with officials reporting earlier this week that the university had implemented measures to help protect our community should a patient be identified in the future.</p>\n<p>The university continues to operate normally. Officials said there are currently no plans to cancel classes, and the university will not plan to do so unless directed by the Yolo County Health Department.</p>\n<p>More about the new coronavirus, from the CDC.</p>\n<p>Look for UC Davis updates at Dateline UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Travel advisory</p>\n<p>With today’s update from Global Affairs, all university affiliates’ China travel plans are subject to review by the Travel Advisory Committee. A handful of faculty members had previously registered their plans to travel to China — and Global Affairs confirmed with those faculty members that all of them had canceled their plans.</p>\n<p>Global Affairs previously posted an advisory to university affiliates to avoid all travel to China, based on guidance from the Department of State and the CDC.</p>\n<p>Look for updated advisories on the Global Affairs’ COVID-19 Travel Announcement page. It includes information on the procedures involved in seeking permission to travel to China.</p>\n<p>Global Affairs also reported that UC Davis has one study abroad program in China, scheduled to begin in late June. Zachary Frieders, interim executive director of the Global Learning Hub, said the university will evaluate the situation before enrollment closes in April, so that if the program is canceled, students have time to enroll in other programs.</p>\n<p>The UC Education Abroad Program has canceled all winter and spring programs in China, affecting three UC Davis students; their program had not yet started.</p>\n<p>The best defense</p>\n<p>To help protect against flu virus — and by extension, coronavirus — Student Affairs and UC Davis Health advice includes: wash your hands often with soap and water; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and try to avoid close contact with sick people. Preventive steps, from the CDC.</p>\n<p>UC Davis officials also are telling people: It is not too late to get a flu shot for added protection.</p>\n<p>Cindy Schorzman, medical director of Student Health and Counseling Services, said: “Any member of our community suspecting they have influenza or the coronavirus should stay home.”</p>\n<p>Students should call the Student Health and Wellness Center, 530-752-2349, or their primary care provider before going in. “This will allow us to provide you with information on your illness, and to plan for your visit to the clinic, if needed,” Schorzman said in a coronavirus update posted Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff should contact their primary care providers for instructions.</p>\n<p>Schorzman’s update also includes an FAQ. It includes this note: Healthy students should not stay home for fear of catching an infection in class.</p>\n<p>Human-to-human transmission</p>\n<p>Marsh's memo today to staff at UC Davis Health came one day after the CDC confirmed the first instance of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the United States, in Chicago. The case, Marsh said, was “not surprising, given what we know about the disease.”</p>\n<p>He said the case involved people in close contact with each other: a husband and wife. The wife recently returned from Wuhan. Not surprisingly, her husband contracted the disease from her.</p>\n<p>“That type of transmission is exactly what we would expect with any coronavirus: When someone who is sick breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes in the vicinity of others, their respiratory droplets can carry the virus toward other people, or onto surfaces such as doorknobs and tables,” Marsh said.</p>\n<p>“It’s all the more reason to practice good hand hygiene and flu prevention techniques. Washing our hands and covering our coughs cannot be done often enough, especially during flu season.”</p>\n<p>Marsh said UC Davis Health is well prepared for coronavirus and “determined to maintain a safe workplace and quality care environment for everyone.”</p>\n<p>He told employees a special coronavirus planning group is meeting twice a week, tasked with ensuring care teams and clinics have all the resources they need.</p>\n<p>“I remain hopeful that the coronavirus here in the U.S. will not become anything like it has overseas,” he told staff. “Your training and professionalism mean that our community and region can be assured that UC Davis Health is prepared for everything.”</p>\n<p>Follow Dateline UC Davis on Twitter.</p>","id":"81265e58-c555-556a-9a71-95cb91ee62d1","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucdavis/2020-04-08-23_21_49/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus: Working Remotely, Beyond April 7"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.ucdavis.edu/sites/default/files/images/article/novel-coronavirus-2_1200_0.jpg\"></p>\n<p>UC Davis Campus Coronavirus Information UC Davis is committed to the safety and well-being of our community.

The county indicates that as of Jan. 31, it had no confirmed cases of the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Fight it like the flu</p>\n<p>Updated 5 p.m. Jan. 31 — UC Davis continues to think locally and globally regarding the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, and is spreading around the world.</p>\n<p>INFLUENZA Protecting yourself against the flu is protecting yourself from “a real and present danger right now here at home,” UC Davis Health’s chief nursing and patient services officer, Toby Marsh, said in a memo to all staff late this afternoon (Jan. 31). “An estimated 15 million people have been infected by the flu this season, with more than 8,000 deaths so far. In our Emergency Department, we are seeing about 150 people a week for influenza. In the past two weeks, nearly half have tested positive for it.”</p>\n<p>The main campus and health system have been stressing to students and others the importance of adhering to the same good hygienic practices that are recommended for protection from another virus — the flu.</p>\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, “person-to-person spread [of coronaviruses] is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.”</p>\n<p>On the global front, UC Davis today (Jan. 31) designated China a “very high threat” travel destination for university affiliates.</p>\n<p>Also today, the number of confirmed cases in California grew to three with the announcement by Santa Clara County’s Public Health Department that the CDC had confirmed a county resident — a man — had tested positive for the novel — or new — coronavirus. The other cases in the state are in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</p>\n<p>UC Davis and UC Davis Health remained vigilant, with officials reporting earlier this week that the university had implemented measures to help protect our community should a patient be identified in the future.</p>\n<p>The university continues to operate normally. Officials said there are currently no plans to cancel classes, and the university will not plan to do so unless directed by the Yolo County Health Department.</p>\n<p>More about the new coronavirus, from the CDC.</p>\n<p>Look for UC Davis updates at Dateline UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Travel advisory</p>\n<p>With today’s update from Global Affairs, all university affiliates’ China travel plans are subject to review by the Travel Advisory Committee. A handful of faculty members had previously registered their plans to travel to China — and Global Affairs confirmed with those faculty members that all of them had canceled their plans.</p>\n<p>Global Affairs previously posted an advisory to university affiliates to avoid all travel to China, based on guidance from the Department of State and the CDC.</p>\n<p>Look for updated advisories on the Global Affairs’ COVID-19 Travel Announcement page. It includes information on the procedures involved in seeking permission to travel to China.</p>\n<p>Global Affairs also reported that UC Davis has one study abroad program in China, scheduled to begin in late June. Zachary Frieders, interim executive director of the Global Learning Hub, said the university will evaluate the situation before enrollment closes in April, so that if the program is canceled, students have time to enroll in other programs.</p>\n<p>The UC Education Abroad Program has canceled all winter and spring programs in China, affecting three UC Davis students; their program had not yet started.</p>\n<p>The best defense</p>\n<p>To help protect against flu virus — and by extension, coronavirus — Student Affairs and UC Davis Health advice includes: wash your hands often with soap and water; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and try to avoid close contact with sick people. Preventive steps, from the CDC.</p>\n<p>UC Davis officials also are telling people: It is not too late to get a flu shot for added protection.</p>\n<p>Cindy Schorzman, medical director of Student Health and Counseling Services, said: “Any member of our community suspecting they have influenza or the coronavirus should stay home.”</p>\n<p>Students should call the Student Health and Wellness Center, 530-752-2349, or their primary care provider before going in. “This will allow us to provide you with information on your illness, and to plan for your visit to the clinic, if needed,” Schorzman said in a coronavirus update posted Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff should contact their primary care providers for instructions.</p>\n<p>Schorzman’s update also includes an FAQ. It includes this note: Healthy students should not stay home for fear of catching an infection in class.</p>\n<p>Human-to-human transmission</p>\n<p>Marsh's memo today to staff at UC Davis Health came one day after the CDC confirmed the first instance of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the United States, in Chicago. The case, Marsh said, was “not surprising, given what we know about the disease.”</p>\n<p>He said the case involved people in close contact with each other: a husband and wife. The wife recently returned from Wuhan. Not surprisingly, her husband contracted the disease from her.</p>\n<p>“That type of transmission is exactly what we would expect with any coronavirus: When someone who is sick breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes in the vicinity of others, their respiratory droplets can carry the virus toward other people, or onto surfaces such as doorknobs and tables,” Marsh said.</p>\n<p>“It’s all the more reason to practice good hand hygiene and flu prevention techniques. Washing our hands and covering our coughs cannot be done often enough, especially during flu season.”</p>\n<p>Marsh said UC Davis Health is well prepared for coronavirus and “determined to maintain a safe workplace and quality care environment for everyone.”</p>\n<p>He told employees a special coronavirus planning group is meeting twice a week, tasked with ensuring care teams and clinics have all the resources they need.</p>\n<p>“I remain hopeful that the coronavirus here in the U.S. will not become anything like it has overseas,” he told staff. “Your training and professionalism mean that our community and region can be assured that UC Davis Health is prepared for everything.”</p>\n<p>Follow Dateline UC Davis on Twitter.</p>","id":"be58d00e-6f49-5794-a4e4-32b795cc05cd","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucdavis/2020-04-08-23_21_52/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus: Working Remotely, Beyond April 7"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/all/themes/university-of-california/assets/images/ucal-fb-image.jpg\"></p>\n<p>The University of California acted last night (March 31) to implement temporary measures which relax undergraduate admissions requirements for students looking to enroll at UC for fall 2020 and future years as applicable. These measures will help mitigate some of the extraordinary challenges students and their families face in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>“We want to help alleviate the tremendous disruption and anxiety that is already overwhelming prospective students due to COVID-19,” said John A. Pérez, chair of the Board of Regents, the governing board for UC. “By removing artificial barriers and decreasing stressors – including suspending the use of the SAT – for this unprecedented moment in time, we hope there will be less worry for our future students.”</p>\n<p>“The COVID-19 outbreak is a disaster of historic proportions disrupting every aspect of our lives, including education for high school students, among others,” said University of California President Janet Napolitano, who endorsed the changes. “The University’s flexibility at this crucial time will ensure prospective students aiming for UC get a full and fair shot — no matter their current challenges.”</p>\n<p>The global health crisis has forced the closure of high schools across the country and prompted sudden shifts to remote instruction. Some schools adopted “pass/fail” or “credit/no credit” grading instead of letter grades for A-G courses needed to qualify for UC admission. These measures had the potential to adversely affect not only the incoming freshman class, but all high school students seeking a UC education, making it challenging to meet University requirements. Meanwhile, K-12 standardized testing and college entrance exams have been cancelled, further thwarting student progress.</p>\n<p>In response, the Regents approved a series of critical, short-term measures:</p>\n<p>Suspending the letter grade requirement for A-G courses completed in winter/spring/summer 2020 for all students, including UC’s most recently admitted freshmen.</p>\n<p>Suspending the standardized test requirement for students applying for fall 2021 freshman admission.</p>\n<p>Providing that there will be no rescission of student admissions offers that result from students or schools missing official final transcript deadlines, and student retention of admission status through the first day of class until official documents are received by campuses.</p>\n<p>For transfer students, temporarily suspending the cap on the number of transferable units with “pass/no pass” grading applied toward the minimum 60 semester/90 quarter units required for junior standing.</p>\n<p>In addition to the University’s actions, the College Board recently announced changes to Advanced Placement (AP) exam content and formats for spring 2020. UC recognizes the effort that students have already applied in these challenging courses and will award UC credit for 2020 AP exams completed with scores of 3, 4 or 5, consistent with previous years.</p>\n<p>“The goal of these changes is to ensure a fair process that does not affect the life chances of students who, but for the coronavirus pandemic, would have become full-time students at the University of California,” said Kum-Kum Bhavnani, chair of the Academic Senate. The Senate exercises direct control over academic matters of central importance to UC and made the admissions recommendations to the Regents.</p>\n<p>UC requests submission of final transcripts by July 1. If schools are unable or unsure about their ability to issue transcripts by this date, they may notify UC at AskUC@ucop.edu and include a date when transcripts are expected to be available.</p>\n<p>For more information on the changes, visit here.</p>","id":"24315ef5-48f7-5765-99e6-b35d0e7220a6","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucdavis/2020-04-10-14_07_33/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"UC admissions requirements to help students, families in wake of COVID-19"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/favicon_0.ico\"></p>\n<p>To: Faculty, Other Academic Appointees, Postdocs</p>\n<p>From: Ka Yee C. Lee, Provost Subject: COVID-19 Planning for Research Date: March 16, 2020</p>\n<p>The rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic requires us to continue to take deliberate steps to actively curtail its spread. Protecting the health and safety of our faculty, researchers, students, staff, and research participants is our top priority, and University leaders and deans have been unequivocal on this point. We – along with our peer institutions – are taking unprecedented steps to safeguard our community, which now must include significantly ramping down on-campus research activities. To help reduce the number of people on campus, we are asking all Principal Investigators who lead on-campus research teams and laboratories and directors of on-campus research facilities to take the following actions immediately :</p>\n<p>Limit the number of people physically present in the research environment to only essential individuals. All people who can conduct their work remotely should do so right away.</p>\n<p>Prioritize the health and safety of your research teams, labs, and participants. The definition of safety will mean different things for different types of research and may change over time. For those who are able to conduct research with no one physically present on campus, research activities should transition online immediately. For those who conduct human subjects research involving person-to-person contact that does not directly benefit the subject, those activities should be suspended immediately.</p>\n<p>Implement public health practices into all research environments, including: limit the number of people physically present to essential people only; implement social distancing strategies for people who must be on site; consider having people work in asynchronous shifts; and use virtual meetings where possible. Visitors (i.e., anyone who does not have an official University of Chicago appointment) and minors are not allowed in any research lab.</p>\n<p>Implement a ramp down of people in your laboratories and facilities without delay. Identify which operations are critical and which can be deferred or paused. Please plan for operating with the minimum number of people physically present to preserve critical functions through at least April 15.</p>\n<p>Develop a plan by Wednesday, March 18 for the possibility of a total lab closure. We need to be prepared for the possibility that we could be required to close one or more labs with little notice, and planning now ensures the greatest opportunity to preserve research and data. Your dean will instruct you where to submit the plan.</p>\n<p>Continue vital research related to COVID-19 and start new projects related to COVID-19, following containment guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and in consultation with the Office of Research Safety.</p>\n<p>We understand the impact that these changes will have on our research community and are actively working to provide support and resources during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>We have created a new website – researchcontinuity.uchicago.edu – to assist in your planning. On this site you can find templates for continuity planning, a ramp-down checklist, and other resources, which a cross-campus working group is developing. This will be updated regularly as new information and resources become available.</p>\n<p>two virtual townhalls for researchers on Tuesday, March 17 at 12:00 PM ( We are planningon Tuesday, March 17 at 12:00 PM ( RSVP here ) and Thursday, March 19 at 3:00 PM ( RSVP here ). You can submit questions in advance using the RSVP forms linked above.</p>\n<p>These decisions are not ones we take lightly, and we appreciate the deep concern you have for your teams and your research. Acting definitely now gives us the best chance of preserving the most critical components of research in the event of a required complete shut-down, and we must be prepared for that possibility.</p>\n<p>We will keep you informed as we move forward together, and we are grateful for your partnership.</p>","id":"7f42b6f1-8ba0-5503-a7bb-9a2aa952eda2","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-uchicago/2020-04-08-23_39_00/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 Planning for Research"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://voices.uchicago.edu/coronavirusupdates/files/2019/04/Corona_updates_fullres.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Email from Provost Ka Yee C.

In turn, we are taking a number of precautions to keep ourselves, our families, and our communities safe. On March 12 we announced that all Spring Quarter classroom instruction for undergraduate and graduate courses would be moved online.</p>\n<p>In careful consultation with the deans and in consideration of feedback from undergraduate and graduate student leaders, we are delaying the start of Spring Quarter by one week, from Monday, March 30 to Monday, April 6 for most units on campus. This will provide University instructors sufficient time to transition to remote learning. The Law School will still begin Spring Quarter on Monday, March 30, to ensure adherence to accreditation guidelines.</p>\n<p>I know this has been a difficult time for all members of our University community, and it is producing many pressures beyond the considerable work required for a normal academic year. The situation calls for us to fundamentally rethink how we teach and learn, conduct research, and collaborate, all on a very short timeline. Your response to this challenge has been inspiring, and I deeply appreciate the flexibility, generosity, and resilience that I have seen from every corner of campus.</p>\n<p>This delayed start means Spring Quarter will have nine weeks of instruction. We hope the one-week delay of Spring Quarter helps our community as we all manage this challenging situation.

In our Emergency Department, we are seeing about 150 people a week for influenza. In the past two weeks, nearly half have tested positive for it.”</p>\n<p>The main campus and health system have been stressing to students and others the importance of adhering to the same good hygienic practices that are recommended for protection from another virus — the flu.</p>\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, “person-to-person spread [of coronaviruses] is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.”</p>\n<p>On the global front, UC Davis today (Jan. 31) designated China a “very high threat” travel destination for university affiliates.</p>\n<p>Also today, the number of confirmed cases in California grew to three with the announcement by Santa Clara County’s Public Health Department that the CDC had confirmed a county resident — a man — had tested positive for the novel — or new — coronavirus. The other cases in the state are in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</p>\n<p>UC Davis and UC Davis Health remained vigilant, with officials reporting earlier this week that the university had implemented measures to help protect our community should a patient be identified in the future.</p>\n<p>The university continues to operate normally. Officials said there are currently no plans to cancel classes, and the university will not plan to do so unless directed by the Yolo County Health Department.</p>\n<p>More about the new coronavirus, from the CDC.</p>\n<p>Look for UC Davis updates at Dateline UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Travel advisory</p>\n<p>With today’s update from Global Affairs, all university affiliates’ China travel plans are subject to review by the Travel Advisory Committee. A handful of faculty members had previously registered their plans to travel to China — and Global Affairs confirmed with those faculty members that all of them had canceled their plans.</p>\n<p>Global Affairs previously posted an advisory to university affiliates to avoid all travel to China, based on guidance from the Department of State and the CDC.</p>\n<p>Look for updated advisories on the Global Affairs’ COVID-19 Travel Announcement page. It includes information on the procedures involved in seeking permission to travel to China.</p>\n<p>Global Affairs also reported that UC Davis has one study abroad program in China, scheduled to begin in late June. Zachary Frieders, interim executive director of the Global Learning Hub, said the university will evaluate the situation before enrollment closes in April, so that if the program is canceled, students have time to enroll in other programs.</p>\n<p>The UC Education Abroad Program has canceled all winter and spring programs in China, affecting three UC Davis students; their program had not yet started.</p>\n<p>The best defense</p>\n<p>To help protect against flu virus — and by extension, coronavirus — Student Affairs and UC Davis Health advice includes: wash your hands often with soap and water; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and try to avoid close contact with sick people. Preventive steps, from the CDC.</p>\n<p>UC Davis officials also are telling people: It is not too late to get a flu shot for added protection.</p>\n<p>Cindy Schorzman, medical director of Student Health and Counseling Services, said: “Any member of our community suspecting they have influenza or the coronavirus should stay home.”</p>\n<p>Students should call the Student Health and Wellness Center, 530-752-2349, or their primary care provider before going in. “This will allow us to provide you with information on your illness, and to plan for your visit to the clinic, if needed,” Schorzman said in a coronavirus update posted Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff should contact their primary care providers for instructions.</p>\n<p>Schorzman’s update also includes an FAQ. It includes this note: Healthy students should not stay home for fear of catching an infection in class.</p>\n<p>Human-to-human transmission</p>\n<p>Marsh's memo today to staff at UC Davis Health came one day after the CDC confirmed the first instance of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the United States, in Chicago. The case, Marsh said, was “not surprising, given what we know about the disease.”</p>\n<p>He said the case involved people in close contact with each other: a husband and wife. The wife recently returned from Wuhan. Not surprisingly, her husband contracted the disease from her.</p>\n<p>“That type of transmission is exactly what we would expect with any coronavirus: When someone who is sick breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes in the vicinity of others, their respiratory droplets can carry the virus toward other people, or onto surfaces such as doorknobs and tables,” Marsh said.</p>\n<p>“It’s all the more reason to practice good hand hygiene and flu prevention techniques. Washing our hands and covering our coughs cannot be done often enough, especially during flu season.”</p>\n<p>Marsh said UC Davis Health is well prepared for coronavirus and “determined to maintain a safe workplace and quality care environment for everyone.”</p>\n<p>He told employees a special coronavirus planning group is meeting twice a week, tasked with ensuring care teams and clinics have all the resources they need.</p>\n<p>“I remain hopeful that the coronavirus here in the U.S. will not become anything like it has overseas,” he told staff. “Your training and professionalism mean that our community and region can be assured that UC Davis Health is prepared for everything.”</p>\n<p>Follow Dateline UC Davis on Twitter.</p>","id":"c9815967-32e6-5a44-8827-90849c76d4f6","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucdavis/2020-04-08-23_21_55/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus: Working Remotely, Beyond April 7"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://voices.uchicago.edu/coronavirusupdates/files/2019/04/Corona_updates_fullres.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Email from President Robert J.

Zimmer, President</p>\n<p>Subject: Spring Quarter</p>\n<p>This week our University of Chicago community will fully embark on a Spring Quarter without precedent – the first in which all classes will be taught remotely, with students and instructors dispersed throughout the world. While many scholarly activities are continuing, most in-person laboratory work on campus has been curtailed, as have workshops, conferences, and other academic gatherings.</p>\n<p>This is therefore a moment of enormous challenge, not only for critical global public health concerns and other important and related forms of well-being for our neighboring communities, not only for individual faculty and students in this new mode of instruction, not only for the many in our community who have had to react to a rapidly changing situation sometimes with considerable personal sacrifice, but for maintaining the key values, meaning, and features of our distinctive University of Chicago academic community. It is critical that while we operate in a different mode, we maintain those features that undergird our distinctive education and research environment: ongoing rigorous intellectual challenge and argument, freedom to explore and question, robust efforts to recognize and challenge assumptions whether our own or those of others, the deep engagement of multiple perspectives and modes of inquiry, the lack of deference to ideas because of authority or popularity, recognition of the importance of culture, history, and context, and the seriousness of intellectual purpose.</p>\n<p>The distinctive nature of our academic community and our approach to education and research did not happen by accident, and they have not endured by accident. Since its inception, the academic values and the distinctive meaning of the University of Chicago have been created and then recreated every day by the faculty, students, and staff on campus, and by the support of our alumni and friends. Since the University’s inception in 1890, there have been many challenges the University, and its faculty, students, staff, and trustees have faced in their time to preserve, enhance, and recreate a university with an enduring commitment to intellectual challenge, rigor, and freedom and all that these entail. We all share the opportunity and responsibility to benefit from and contribute to this institution and its meaning, building upon the work of those who have come before us.</p>\n<p>We have arrived at a moment in which we as a community are called upon to meet the challenge of remote learning and academic engagement and to preserve our enduring values, approach, and meaning. Each one of us must do our part. We will surely learn from this experience and learn from each other. As in all experiments, not everything will go perfectly. But with commitment, energy, and resourcefulness, I am confident that we will not only preserve what is so distinctive about the University of Chicago, but also find new ways in which our enduring values and meaning can be realized. This is our challenge as a community, a challenge of our time. We must undertake it together and do so recognizing the importance of the task. Together we will succeed.</p>\n<p>I wish each of you success in your hard and challenging work in the coming quarter, and thank you for your commitment to the nature of education and research that the University of Chicago has always represented and must continue to represent.</p>","id":"07353ec6-02b6-5158-994f-6a3fb1fa6335","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-uchicago/2020-04-10-14_04_28/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"UChicago President Email (Apr. 5)"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://voices.uchicago.edu/coronavirusupdates/files/2019/04/Corona_updates_fullres.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Email from President Robert J. Zimmer (Apr. 7, 2020)</p>\n<p>From: Robert J. Zimmer</p>\n<p>Subject: Financial Implications of COVID-19</p>\n<p>During recent months, the University of Chicago and our faculty, students, and staff have been focused on the health impacts of COVID-19. We have taken significant steps to protect the health and safety of our University community. We have worked to act responsibly in this global pandemic towards the larger communities of which we are a part and to which we have a responsibility, and through several initiatives to offer support to and partnership with our South Side communities.</p>\n<p>While the health issues continue, the global, national, and local economic impact of the pandemic is already profound, and for some time likely to become only more so. This will have severe consequences on the finances of the University. The expected financial impact on the University and its duration is likely to be as great as or even greater than in the financial crisis of 2008-09. It will be complicated by the uncertainties of the trajectory of the ongoing global pandemic. These financial challenges for the University will be similar to those faced by universities and colleges around the country.</p>\n<p>Some salient aspects of financial challenges include:</p>\n<p>Increased national economic stress, resulting in economic challenges for many families and requiring increased financial support for a number of our students, which we are committed to providing.</p>\n<p>With the dramatic decreases in equity and other financial markets, a corresponding decrease in the value of our endowment and hence in the annual payout from the endowment to support the University’s work.</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, a decrease in the expected philanthropic contributions to the University from our alumni and friends.</p>\n<p>Significant decrease in net revenue in the Medical Center due to the extensive work connected to COVID-19, with a corresponding decrease in available Medical Center support for academic work.</p>\n<p>Increased costs associated in programs dealing with COVID-19 health matters.</p>\n<p>Uncertainties in the credit markets that are important for new capital projects.</p>\n<p>Uncertainties in private and federal research funding opportunities following the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\n<p>As a result, the University will be asking every academic and administrative unit to make significant adjustments in expenditures, both immediately and in the next academic year. It may be necessary to continue some of these adjustments into the future as we gain clarity about the trajectory of the pandemic and the resulting national global economic dislocations. Certain underlying principles will guide these adjustments.</p>\n<p>All student financial support commitments will be fully honored and increased financial support will be provided to those College students with increased demonstrated need.</p>\n<p>The University is deeply committed to maintaining the most intellectually free and challenging environment and in doing so to provide the most empowering education for students and foster the most original and impactful research of our faculty.</p>\n<p>The provost will be working with the deans, vice presidents, and other leaders to articulate and implement financial adjustments. Every unit of the University will be called upon to participate. Among high level steps we will be taking as a University and that will apply broadly include:</p>\n<p>All individual faculty, staff, and administrative salaries for the academic year 2020-21 will remain at current levels (except when contractually required).</p>\n<p>New staff hiring will be strictly limited to those fully supported by external grant funding or critical to the core mission of the University.</p>\n<p>Academic hiring will be slowed.</p>\n<p>Discretionary spending will be suspended.</p>\n<p>Non-personnel expenditure reductions will be implemented. The details of implementation will be directed by the provost through the work with deans, vice presidents, and other leaders.</p>\n<p>The University’s financial support for students is dependent upon the philanthropic contributions of our alumni, friends, and parents. The Odyssey program began with a $100 million anonymous gift in 2007. We have made it a priority to systematically expand this program, which has been enabled by thousands of individuals – including trustees, alumni, friends, parents, faculty, and staff – providing further philanthropic support for the Odyssey program. Given the increased demand for financial support, we will be prioritizing this direction for philanthropy in the coming year. As a start, every officer of the University (president, provost, and vice presidents) will make a significant new personal financial commitment to the Odyssey program, and we encourage those in our community who are in a position to make such a commitment to seriously consider doing so in this time of increased financial challenge for many of our students. To make a contribution, please click here.</p>\n<p>The financial actions we will be taking are necessary to protect the University’s ability over time to support students and their education, faculty and their research and teaching, and the impact that we can have on the betterment of the quality of human life. These will be difficult actions for all of us.

Hopefully, students will also treat instructors with grace as we all figure out this world of Emergency Distance Learning together.</p>\n<p>As you prepare for the start of the quarter, please note the resources and advice surrounding technology for distance collaboration, teaching, learning, and other work.</p>\n<p>Additional Technology Resources:</p>\n<p>As a reminder, UCI has TWO programs through which you can get access to additional technology that you might need during this time of emergency distance learning. If your need is predominantly as a student, meaning you need a laptop to TAKE classes, please use the loan program through the Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning. If your need is predominantly as an employee, meaning you need a laptop to teach, grade, conduct your sponsored research, you should use the program through your hiring department. Using the correct program helps us to get the right support to the right place as quickly as possible. Any attempt to make requests that are not needed, to request from both programs at once, or to otherwise disrupt this system hurts our most vulnerable students. Please be kind to one another.</p>\n<p>Internet Access:</p>\n<p>This message went out Friday evening to faculty from OIT, but it may be relevant to many of you as well:</p>\n<p>If you are trying to conduct remote instruction from home, it is possible you may encounter internet performance problems. We wanted provide some options to help you mitigate this potential issue:</p>\n<p>Upgrade your broadband through your Internet Service Provider (ISP).Broadband is generally the fastest, most consistently performing option for connecting to the internet. Many ISPs are providing free broadband upgrades for faculty, when asked. Contact your ISP to request this. Come to campus and record your lectures using UCI's network. Campus is working on a plan to provide remote teaching classrooms for faculty who need them. More information on these classroom spaces will be coming soon. Use your existing smartphone as a hotspot. As a last resort, you can set up your phone as a mobile hotspot and connect to it. This option is generally not as fast or reliable as broadband service, but it can work if needed. Contact your cellular phone provider and ask for a free upgrade to tethering and unlimited data, as a faculty member teaching remotely.</p>\n<p>Contact information for internet and cellular service providers and more details can be found on the TechPrep @ UCI website under Internet Connectivity: Resources to help you get connected from off-campus.</p>\n<p>Office Hours:</p>\n<p>Don’t forget I am holding office hours each weekday.

He went on to become the director of the Peace Corps in Nepal, traveled around promoting Outward Bound, and eventually became a founding faculty member at Evergreen State College in Washington State, where he focused on experiential education. A hero to many, Unsoeld’s life and mission teach us many things. For me, it is an attention to the natural environment all around us. The quiet of this new world of social isolation has renewed my appreciation for the sunshine and flowers, and I hope that despite the stress and pain, you are enjoying these things too. Unsoeld, having conquered some of the toughest challenges in the world, also had this advice to offer about community:</p>\n<p>“Take care of each other. Share your energies with the group. No one must feel alone, cut off, for that is when you do not make it.”</p>\n<p>He was talking about high altitude trekking, but the same can be said for all of you, for all of us. I am so pleased by the spirit of caring and community I see all around UCI. I know that together, we can make it through this challenge. We will come out stronger on the other side.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all you are doing. As always, I hope to see you soon.</p>\n<p>Sending you my best and that of all of Graduate Division,</p>\n<p>Gillian</p>\n<p>Gillian Hayes</p>\n<p>Kleist Professor of Informatics</p>\n<p>Vice Provost for Graduate Education</p>\n<p>Dean of the Graduate Division</p>","id":"2f59060a-6694-5c21-8df1-da72a40c657c","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-uci/2020-04-08-23_45_09/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Graduate Division COVID-19 Update"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://web.communications.uci.edu/assets/2015/img/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>March 27, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Grad Students and Post-Docs,</p>\n<p>Each day since we received orders to “stay at home” from the governor have brought us each our own trials. More than 3 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, and in a world without universal healthcare, this means many have lost their ability to combat this pandemic at the same time. Although all of you can get health insurance through UCI, you may have partners, friends, and others in need. If so, please remember that they can buy coverage at Covered California if they are in this state. Also, please remember if your friends or family have been laid off as part of this crisis, they can file for state unemployment as well as the additional federal coverage provided by the stimulus package.</p>\n<p>A big thanks to David Levinson, owner of Levinson Tax Services and current Merage MPAc student, for writing a summary of the stimulus package that even I could understand.</p>\n<p>Answers to Some Questions We Have Been Getting</p>\n<p>Coursework</p>\n<p>You may have noticed that the campus has made it possible (via the Registrar) to change between graded and not much later into the quarter than typically allowed.</p>\n<p>For grad classes, P/NP is not a valid option if you want it to “count.” It must be S/U (satisfactory-unsatisfactory). Don’t ask me why. It way predates me, and I honestly don’t know. Please watch for it though if you are in a course in which faculty have turned on these options.</p>\n<p>If you are a TA/Reader, please remember to share grade information regularly with your students so that they can make the best decision for themselves whether they want things graded.</p>\n<p>Broad implementation of grading strategies at the graduate level continue to be in the control of the schools and programs. Some have chosen to go with a wide range of S/U courses and some have not. In some cases, these decisions are impacted by accreditation and professional certification requirements. Please check in with your grad program advisor if you have questions about this.</p>\n<p>Michael Dennin, Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning, will be hosting a series of office hours for the next two weeks to help with the ramping up of the quarter.</p>\n<p>These will be 4 – 5 pm on:</p>\n<p>Monday March 30</p>\n<p>Tuesday March 31</p>\n<p>Thursday April 2</p>\n<p>Tuesday April 7</p>\n<p>Wednesday April 8</p>\n<p>Thursday April 9</p>\n<p>The Zoom link for the office hours is: <a href=\"https://uci.zoom.us/j/254764170\">https://uci.zoom.us/j/254764170</a></p>\n<p>Emergency Financial Support</p>\n<p>Some of you have reached out about rent relief and other sources of aid during this crisis. Student Affairs, Housing, and other facilities are currently being assessed for what can be done. What I have seen of their efforts is a group of people working as hard as they can as fast as they can to do the best they can by all of you while also recognizing the impacts of the massive loss of revenue from students moving out, conferences cancelling, and limits on external programs. We must balance what we do to keep both students and staff safe, keep our staff employed even without our usual operating funds, and keep essential services up and running. UCI is working with local, state, and federal authorities to access as much emergency funding as we can as well as tapping donor bases, grants, and other sources of revenue. I hope to be able to share positive results from all of these efforts soon.</p>\n<p>Extensions</p>\n<p>We have gotten a lot of concerned messages about attempting to advance to candidacy or meet other deadlines in Spring quarter. Faculty from individual programs and the academic senate (Graduate Council) have control of these rules. However, a few current details may help ease some of your concerns. Summer quarter counts as part of the year you are in now. So, if you are trying to advance by end of “this year,” you are good as long as you do it by the day before fall quarter (end of September). Additionally, we have waived filing fees and many other fees for Spring and Summer quarters. We have also asked faculty to be flexible and allow for major exams of this kind in the summer if at all possible. So, this should give you a decent amount of flexibility. Obviously, we will continue to watch things, and if additional extensions become necessary, Graduate Council (faculty senate) is very much ready to take up this issue. As always, Graduate Division (my team) maintains the ability to grant extensions on an individual basis should you have specific needs.</p>\n<p>Research Continuity</p>\n<p>The Office of Research has provided guidance on research continuity on their website:<a href=\"https://news.research.uci.edu/research-continuity/\">https://news.research.uci.edu/research-continuity/</a></p>\n<p>Most research falls in one of these categories:</p>\n<p>Critical Research: Essential experiments, COVID related research, and so on. If your work is in these categories, you may continue work. You MUST use good social distancing. If your PI is not following these guidelines, you should talk with your department chair or Associate Dean for Research.</p>\n<p>Research that can be conducted online (or from home): You can continue to analyze data, write articles and books, do close readings, etc if you can do them from home. You can also collect new data if it can be done remotely.</p>\n<p>Research that cannot be conducted from home and is not critical: In most cases, this work has been paused.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what category your work falls into, you may be struggling to be “productive.” You may also find respite in the work. Either response (or both!) are completely normal. Please work with your PI, thesis advisor, department chairs, DECADE mentors, and everyone else who can help you work through this time. There are no right or wrong answers unfortunately. We also have no way to predict how any of us will be feeling in another two weeks. Do the best you can and keep communication lines open.</p>\n<p>In Closing</p>\n<p>Don’t forget I am holding office hours each weekday. You don’t have to have a question to stop by office hours, you can just come to chat.

Be patient while we wait for a cure. Be patient while we wait for a vaccine. Be patient while you wait to see if your young son’s dry cough is going to progress, to see if you or your husband will get whatever he has. Be patient while they restock the shelves. Be patient while you wait for your sister-in-law to file for unemployment. Be patient while you wait on hold trying to get her healthcare coverage. Be patient while your students await job interviews that have to be rescheduled. Be patient with all those projects that are now delayed because the resources have had to be diverted elsewhere. Patience. Patience. Patience. The last two weeks have felt like a year. I don’t know about you, but I am running a bit low on it. And so each morning, I try to remind myself to have patience, with myself, with everyone else, with the universe. Some of the greatest minds for millennia have reminded us of the virtue of patience. Their words, repeated throughout each day, have helped me, and I hope they help you:</p>\n<p>“Endurance is nobler than strength, and patience than beauty.” John Ruskin</p>\n<p>“Patience is the key to contentment.” The Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him)</p>\n<p>“Patience attracts happiness; it brings near that which is far.” Swahili Proverb</p>\n<p>“But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.” Romans 8:25</p>\n<p>As always, hoping to see you in person soon.</p>\n<p>On behalf of all of Graduate Divsion,</p>\n<p>Gillian</p>\n<p>Gillian Hayes</p>\n<p>Kleist Professor of Informatics</p>\n<p>Vice Provost for Graduate Education</p>\n<p>Dean of the Graduate Division</p>","id":"3eaefb54-ddc8-5984-9a19-1547a85b00c9","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-uci/2020-04-08-23_45_12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Graduate Division COVID-19 Update"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://web.communications.uci.edu/assets/2015/img/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>March 25, 2020</p>\n<p>Hello Grad Students and Post-Docs,</p>\n<p>I hope you are getting a chance to enjoy your spring break as much as you can. Here are a few reminders and updates regarding the COVID-19 virus and the adjustments Graduate Division is making.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to our 2020 Grad Slam Champion: Rebecca Riley!</p>\n<p>I want to start this message with a very heartfelt congratulations to Rebecca Riley, who was named UCI’s 2020 Grad Slam Champion last month! Rebecca is a doctoral student studying Theoretical Particle Physics. In her Grad Slam talk entitled In the Dark Corners of the Universe, Rebecca describes the mystery of dark matter and its importance to the world - all in under 3 minutes! Take a listen to her impressive talk on why dark matter...well, matters!

We know Rebecca would have made us proud!</p>\n<p>DSC COVID-19 Update</p>\n<p>The DSC website has been updated with accessibility tips and resources for online instruction and remote classes for faculty and students. Please visit<a href=\"https://dsc.uci.edu/covid19/\">https://dsc.uci.edu/covid19/</a> for more.</p>\n<p>Form Fee Waivers for Spring and Summer</p>\n<p>As mentioned before, Graduate Division will accept scanned documents and digital signatures for all forms related to enrolled services and exceptions until further notice. In addition to accepting forms electronically, fees linked to the following forms and student status updates will be waived through Spring and Summer quarters to facilitate you filing digitally and to provide additional time into the summer for major exams. Even though these fees are waived, please still turn in your forms and get department approval first. You can show they have approved either by having them digitally sign the form or by attaching an email with their approval when you send your request to us at grad@uci.edu. These are the fees that are waived for Spring and Summer quarters.</p>\n<p>Filing Fee</p>\n<p>Summer Filing Fee</p>\n<p>Master’s Thesis Signature Page/Report on the Final Examination for the Master’s Degree</p>\n<p>Ph.D. Form I-Advancement to Candidacy</p>\n<p>Readmission Petition for Graduate Students</p>\n<p>Access to Graduate Counselors</p>\n<p>We encourage you to remain connected to your current social support network, both near and far (near at a minimum distance of 6 feet/1.83 meters of course!).

I know it is a super stresssful time, and the idea of applying for a fellowship might not be in the forefront of your mind. However, between August and December, there are SO many fellowship deadlines, and we want you to be as successful as possible. Right now is an excellent time to begin identifying fellowships and learning about application requirements. This gives you plenty of time to draft and prepare competitive materials for these prestigious awards and for us to help you craft those materials.</p>\n<p>Don’t know where to start? Set up a virtual fellowship advising appointment with Dr. Kayleigh Anderson-Natale. Click here to request a meeting. Fellowship advising appointments can be spent:</p>\n<p>Identifying and discussing resources for finding appropriate fellowships</p>\n<p>Discussing strategies for drafting competitive application materials</p>\n<p>Provide feedback on fellowship materials content, such as appropriateness of proposed research, etc.</p>\n<p>Help to find answers to questions about specific fellowships National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships Fulbright Fellowships Ford Fellowships</p>\n<p>We also still recommend consulting wtih our GPSRC Writing Consultants for writing specific needs, such as help with grammar, structure, clarity, etc.</p>\n<p>GPSRC Programming Reminders</p>\n<p>One-on-one appointments will continue to take place virtually through spring quarter.</p>\n<p>Writing Appointments</p>\n<p>Writing appointments will be available via Zoom.

All graduate students and postdocs are welcome!</p>\n<p>You don’t have to have a question to stop by office hours, you can just come to chat.

Below are our office hours for the next two weeks. All times are Pacific Standard Time.</p>\n<p>Thursday, March 26: 1pm – 1:30pm</p>\n<p>Monday, March 30: 9:00am – 9:30am</p>\n<p>Tuesday, March 31: 1pm – 1:30pm</p>\n<p>Wednesday, April 1: 10am – 10:30am</p>\n<p>Thursday, April 2: 12:30pm – 1:00pm</p>\n<p>Friday, April 3: 10am – 10:30am</p>\n<p>In Closing</p>\n<p>I want to close today by talking a bit about how many of us are feeling right now. I heard the news today that Cal State was on a hiring freeze only shortly before learning that the partner of someone I care about a lot got a tenure track position at a community college. I heard the news today that Brown University was on a hiring freeze only shortly after seeing a copy of a contract for a tenure track position that someone asked me to look over so she could sign it. The roller coaster of emotions is nearly crushing, and these are not my own jobs but those of people in the UCI community. I can only imagine how it must feel to be at or near the end of your academic journey as either a post-doc or grad student and looking into this job market.</p>\n<p>Even for those who have a few years for the economy to recover before you search for jobs, summer internships have been disrupted, partners and family members may have been laid off. This is a brutal time for so many. Some of you may feel emboldened or focused or motivated by these times of crisis. Some of you may be able to only do the bare minimum each day to keep your health, your family’s health, and your life in order. I hope you are kind and generous with yourselves. We are not even two weeks into the “stay at home” order, and we have no idea what time will bring.</p>\n<p>It is okay to grieve. And please know that you are grieving. I’ve said before that I am an optimist, and I remain so. We are all living through something that no living person has ever seen, and we must hope that we will never see it again.</p>\n<p>“When the unthinkable happens, the lighthouse is hope. Once we choose hope, everything is possible.” – Christopher Reeve</p>\n<p>I am deeply sad for the pain that so many of you are feeling. I am anxious on my own. But I also have hope. I hope that we will learn from this time. I hope that we will find a cure. I hope that we will see a vaccine soon. I hope that disruption will be minimal.</p>\n<p>And as always, I hope to see you all in person soon!</p>\n<p>Gillian Hayes</p>\n<p>Kleist Professor of Informatics</p>\n<p>Vice Provost for Graduate Education</p>\n<p>Dean of the Graduate Division</p>","id":"939354bb-de42-56a7-9bae-7aba4659efd8","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-uci/2020-04-08-23_45_14/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Graduate Division COVID-19 Update"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://security.ucop.edu/_internal/_files/images/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Zoom Best Practices</p>\n<p>Joint Statement of the UC Location CIOs</p>\n<p>April 7, 2020</p>\n<p>To provide the necessary tools to support the rapid transition to online learning and remote work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most UC locations expanded their use of Zoom for teaching, research, telemedicine, and administration. Ten UC locations have obtained site licenses to provide Zoom access for all faculty, staff, and students.</p>\n<p>As the university’s Chief Information Officers, we are very aware and concerned that Zoom is experiencing security and privacy issues. Our UC IT security and privacy experts are closely monitoring these issues and Zoom’s responses.</p>\n<p>Zoom has been quick to respond to these issues, including the timely release of security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. UC locations also have issued guidance for their users, which is found below. Such guidance will be revised as necessary, based on any new findings.</p>\n<p>In addition, UC has a systemwide agreement in place with Zoom, which includes the UC Data Security Appendix and a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement. The terms of this agreement address UC’s needs and provide greater security and privacy protections than Zoom’s standard agreement terms.</p>\n<p>Privacy and security are a joint responsibility of both Zoom and our UC communities. There are a few keys steps all of us can take to best ensure the privacy and security of our Zoom interactions:</p>\n<p>All Zoom users should install client software updates as soon as they are available.</p>\n<p>Zoom meeting hosts should set their accounts to provide the highest protection for the privacy of all meeting participants in accordance with their location’s published guidance (listed below).</p>\n<p>All Zoom users should periodically check their location’s published guidance for updates.</p>\n<p>In sum, Zoom has been responsive to the security and privacy concerns and, while it is important for our IT security and privacy experts to monitor the situation, we believe that at present Zoom continues to be an appropriate option for online learning and remote work.

Please attend to issues of accessibility in your research, teaching, and correspondence.</p>\n<p>Accessibility During COVID-19</p>\n<p>In Accessibility Suffers During Pandemic, Inside Higher Ed describes how students with disabilities and their advocates worry about access to equitable education. Our Disability Services Center has been working around the clock to ensure our students have appropriate access. Please reach out to them if you need help, can volunteer to help others, or have questions.</p>\n<p>Microsoft also published an interesting article, What the disability community can teach us about working remotely, in which they describe working with and learning from their employees and by continuing to prioritize accessibility in these shifting circumstances. Microsoft has been a leader in inclusive hiring and work practices. It is nice to see them continuing to do so.</p>\n<p>Division of Career Pathways Services Update</p>\n<p>Please note that DCP will continue to offer one-on-one career counseling appointments through both Zoom andphone as well as “virtual office hours” on Wednesdays from 1-3 to temporarily replace in-person drop in times.

In these unprecedented times, we are guided by our goal of protecting the safety of our Bruin community. But we should have known the impact this decision would make, especially during this tense time, and we should have listened first. For this, I apologize.</p>\n<p>We have heard the important voices of our students and their families, and based on those, we will step back and make a decision on commencement in consultation with students and student leaders. I understand that for so many of our students and their families and friends, our commencement ceremonies celebrate not only past achievements, but also the promise of what is to come.</p>\n<p>I deeply appreciate the hard work and dedication that goes into earning a UCLA degree. It is a great accomplishment fully deserving of a ceremony that acknowledges students’ years of commitment to reaching that milestone. Our ceremonies are as diverse as our student body. Whether it is our campus, departmental or student-initiated commencement, our ceremonies are without question the most wonderful and moving events that we have on our campus, not only because they honor our students, but also because they give family and friends who supported them a proud moment they, too, will carry for the rest of their lives.</p>\n<p>The decisions we have had to make in the past few weeks, all designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect our community, are ones that few of us ever anticipated in our lifetimes. We are all working hard to adapt to rapidly evolving circumstances and find ways to prioritize the health of our community. In this environment, despite our best efforts, sometimes we move too quickly. I regret that we did that here and did not properly include students in the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>We will be connecting with our student leadership, including the Undergraduate Students Association Council and Graduate Students Association, so that we can make these decisions together.</p>\n<p>We are committed to giving all of our students the commencement they deserve. We should have known the tremendous impact that this decision would have on our students and their loved ones and friends. We will do better to include these important voices going forward.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>","id":"a5221ba5-4086-5ea9-97d5-d9f49dac1144","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucla/2020-04-08-23_41_47/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Making Commencement Decisions Together"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.bso.ucla.edu/sites/g/files/yaccgq1231/f/it-favico_64x64.png\"></p>\n<p>Update on Spring Quarter Grading</p>\n<p>To the Campus Community:</p>\n<p>The Academic Senate wishes to express its appreciation to all the faculty, staff, and students who have put in such extraordinary efforts to complete the winter quarter under the stress of moving final assessments to alternative modes in response to COVID-19. We also recognize that the necessity to move to remote instruction for spring quarter will continue to pose new challenges and stresses for the campus community. We wish to acknowledge that our current situation presents considerable hardships for our students and that those hardships may fall unequally on different students.</p>\n<p>Under the university’s system of shared governance, the UCLA Academic Senate has purview over certain aspects of UCLA, distinct from the administration overseen by the chancellor. In particular, the Senate makes decisions on such matters as degree and enrollment requirements, grading policy and program establishment, disestablishment, and review.</p>\n<p>In order to support faculty, staff, and students in their efforts to sustain instructional continuity and do their best work productively under these circumstances, the Undergraduate and Graduate Councils of the Senate have exercised their purview and taken steps to increase flexibility and reduce stress for all those involved with the instructional effort. These steps are listed below.</p>\n<p>The Undergraduate Council has voted:</p>\n<p>To suspend UCLA Senate Regulation A-310 (A) and (E) for spring quarter 2020, and to empower undergraduate students in good standing to take more than one course in a term on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. To extend the deadline for changing the grading basis on an optionally graded course using MyUCLA without need for petition to the last day of instruction for spring quarter 2020. To recommend that the campus eliminate the fees to drop a course and to change the grading basis on an optionally graded course after Friday of Week 2 for spring quarter 2020.</p>\n<p>The Graduate Council has voted:</p>\n<p>To temporarily delegate authority to departments, Interdepartmental Degree Programs (IDPs), or schools to allow graduate students in good academic standing to enroll in more than one course graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis for spring quarter 2020, including courses within the degree program, with the stipulation that departments, IDPs, or schools must accept these courses towards fulfilling degree requirements if taken for an S/U grade. To recommend that the campus eliminate the fees to drop a course and to change the grading basis on an optionally graded course after Friday of Week 2 for spring quarter 2020.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that graduate students are already permitted to change the grading basis on an optionally graded course using MyUCLA without need for petition to the last day of instruction.</p>\n<p>These suspensions and delegations should provide both graduate and undergraduate students with the capacity to choose a course of study that will enable them to continue their progress to degree and also to adjust their academic burdens in accord with their own personal needs at this time. We recognize that these actions will not solve all of the challenges associated with remote education. But after careful consideration and review of all options, we are confident that they will best support the efforts of faculty, staff, and students as we work together to address the challenges of spring quarter.</p>\n<p>Reminder for Instructors</p>\n<p>The Academic Senate would also like to remind all instructors that the partial suspensions of Senate Regulations 332 and 505 (PDF) continue in force. These suspensions empower you to have greater flexibility both in the forms of assessment you plan to use and also in the distribution of points among different assessments. As with this past quarter, we urge instructors to use this flexibility to take into account the special challenges that will accompany remote instruction. Given the uncertainties surrounding technical issues and the possibilities of disrupted connections, as well as the closure of libraries and study spaces, we urge everyone to approach spring quarter with mutual compassion and openness to the challenges faced by all.</p>\n<p>Reminders for Undergraduate and Graduate Students</p>\n<p>We also want to point out several issues that students should consider as they chart their course for spring quarter:</p>\n<p>The capacity to declare P/NP or S/U in multiple courses is not presently available through MyUCLA. The Registrar is working diligently on this issue and expects it to be available by mid-quarter. As a result, you do not have to make any changes in your grading choices at this time. You will be able to do that later in the quarter.</p>\n<p>We do recommend, however, that you check to make certain that any courses you might wish to take P/NP or S/U offer that option to students.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that this change in grading policy does not override any requirements that colleges, departments, or programs may have that courses be taken for a letter grade in order to receive major or program credit. Please check with your advisers and counselors before you consider courses in your home program or major.</p>\n<p>Certain forms of financial aid require that you enroll for a minimum number of credits with letter grades. Please consult with Financial Aid about your particular situation.</p>\n<p>We have moved the deadline for changing your grade option in undergraduate courses from letter to P/NP until Friday of the 10th week of classes. This will allow you to evaluate your standing in a class before making a final grade option selection.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that systemwide regulations require that undergraduate students receive a C or better in order to earn a Pass in a P/NP. Similarly at UCLA, undergraduate students who take a course P/NP must achieve a C in order to receive a Pass. Undergraduate students who take a course for a letter grade will receive credit if they receive a C- or a D. So, the threshold for receiving course credit is higher for an undergraduate student taking a course P/NP.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that systemwide regulations require that graduate students receive a B or better in order to earn a Satisfactory in a S/U. At UCLA, graduate students may receive course credit for C- and above grades unless otherwise prohibited by program requirements. So, the threshold for receiving course credit is higher for a graduate student taking a course S/U than is required to receive credit when taking under a letter grade.</p>\n<p>The minimum GPA for a graduate degree is 3.0, so graduate students should carefully consider whether to use the S/U option depending on their individual situation, as S/U courses are not used in GPA calculations.</p>\n<p>We recognize the large challenges facing the campus and its faculty, students, and staff during spring quarter. We remain confident in the resilience of the UCLA community to work together in a spirit of patience and empathy as we pursue our educational goals during an uncertain time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Michael Meranze</p>\n<p>Professor of History</p>\n<p>Chair, UCLA Academic Senate</p>","id":"5dff9949-7bf0-5579-921a-719e9766f641","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucla/2020-04-08-23_41_44/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CORONAVIRUS UPDATE 32 Academic Senate"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://chancellor.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-ucla-32x32.png\"></p>\n<p>Plans for Spring 2020 Commencement Ceremonies</p>\n<p>Chancellor Block sent the following message to the UCLA campus community.</p>\n<p>To the Campus Community:</p>\n<p>Being a Bruin means more than just being on UCLA’s campus; it also encompasses the emotional and social ties we share with one another.

Consistent with our tradition, the ceremony will feature an inspiring keynote speaker, whose name will be announced soon. The College will offer new opportunities to connect our graduates in a variety of ways that further enhance the virtual event.</p>\n<p>As we move into a spring quarter of remote learning, please know that we are actively exploring how we might enhance the student experience while everyone is away from campus, particularly for our seniors.</p>\n<p>For the soon-to-be graduates of UCLA, in the weeks ahead, we will provide additional information about how we will mark their important accomplishments.</p>\n<p>Campus leadership will be in touch with the schools and departments that hold individual commencements to provide support where possible. We will share more details about those efforts as soon as we are able.</p>\n<p>Please remember that, even for an event as momentous as commencement, the day does not define the journey. We will work diligently to make graduation as special as possible for all of our students and all of your loved ones. Even when we are apart, we remain deeply connected as Bruins, and I look forward to celebrating your accomplishments this spring.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>","id":"c994d1cf-56c8-528d-84f6-a1c62fcfa2b0","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucla/2020-04-08-23_41_50/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Plans for Spring 2020 Commencement Ceremonies"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.bso.ucla.edu/sites/g/files/yaccgq1231/f/it-favico_64x64.png\"></p>\n<p>To: Deans and Department Chair: Extension of Graduate Thesis and Dissertation Submission Deadlines for Winter Quarter</p>\n<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>\n<p>To ensure that graduate students are impacted as little as possible by the rapidly changing events associated with COVID-19, the Graduate Council has voted to extend dissertation, thesis and capstone project filing deadlines from March 20, 2020 to April 10, 2020 for the winter 2020 quarter.

In another new directive, they said the university’s event attendance cap of 150 people will be extended through the end of spring quarter — which means Picnic Day is among the casualties. Still, the campus remains open and students can stay. UC Davis’ comprehensive educational and personal support services will be available in both in-person (small groups with social distancing) and remote formats.</p>\n<p>The letter focuses on instruction, including graduate education and training, but notes the campus’s efforts “to help all members of our community find ways to adapt to our current situation.” Human Resources has prepared guidance for supervisors and managers on workplace concerns, such as employees who become sick or need to care for loved ones, and a telework page that allows managers to make decisions concerning remote work arrangements.</p>\n<p>And, for employees and students with young children who are impacted by the recent K-12 school closures, “please know we will do our best to be flexible and understanding during these most unprecedented times.”</p>\n<p>“Working together as a community, in accordance with our Principles of Community, we will continue to adapt to these challenging times,” the letter states.</p>\n<p>Read the spring quarter directives message.</p>\n<p>Yolo has 2nd positive test</p>\n<p>Updated 7 p.m. March 13 — The Yolo County Health and Human Services Agency announced it has received confirmation that a second county resident has tested positive for COVID-19.

In our Emergency Department, we are seeing about 150 people a week for influenza. In the past two weeks, nearly half have tested positive for it.”</p>\n<p>The main campus and health system have been stressing to students and others the importance of adhering to the same good hygienic practices that are recommended for protection from another virus — the flu.</p>\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, “person-to-person spread [of coronaviruses] is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.”</p>\n<p>On the global front, UC Davis today (Jan. 31) designated China a “very high threat” travel destination for university affiliates.</p>\n<p>Also today, the number of confirmed cases in California grew to three with the announcement by Santa Clara County’s Public Health Department that the CDC had confirmed a county resident — a man — had tested positive for the novel — or new — coronavirus. The other cases in the state are in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</p>\n<p>UC Davis and UC Davis Health remained vigilant, with officials reporting earlier this week that the university had implemented measures to help protect our community should a patient be identified in the future.</p>\n<p>The university continues to operate normally. Officials said there are currently no plans to cancel classes, and the university will not plan to do so unless directed by the Yolo County Health Department.</p>\n<p>More about the new coronavirus, from the CDC.</p>\n<p>Look for UC Davis updates at Dateline UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Travel advisory</p>\n<p>With today’s update from Global Affairs, all university affiliates’ China travel plans are subject to review by the Travel Advisory Committee. A handful of faculty members had previously registered their plans to travel to China — and Global Affairs confirmed with those faculty members that all of them had canceled their plans.</p>\n<p>Global Affairs previously posted an advisory to university affiliates to avoid all travel to China, based on guidance from the Department of State and the CDC.</p>\n<p>Look for updated advisories on the Global Affairs’ COVID-19 Travel Announcement page. It includes information on the procedures involved in seeking permission to travel to China.</p>\n<p>Global Affairs also reported that UC Davis has one study abroad program in China, scheduled to begin in late June. Zachary Frieders, interim executive director of the Global Learning Hub, said the university will evaluate the situation before enrollment closes in April, so that if the program is canceled, students have time to enroll in other programs.</p>\n<p>The UC Education Abroad Program has canceled all winter and spring programs in China, affecting three UC Davis students; their program had not yet started.</p>\n<p>The best defense</p>\n<p>To help protect against flu virus — and by extension, coronavirus — Student Affairs and UC Davis Health advice includes: wash your hands often with soap and water; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and try to avoid close contact with sick people. Preventive steps, from the CDC.</p>\n<p>UC Davis officials also are telling people: It is not too late to get a flu shot for added protection.</p>\n<p>Cindy Schorzman, medical director of Student Health and Counseling Services, said: “Any member of our community suspecting they have influenza or the coronavirus should stay home.”</p>\n<p>Students should call the Student Health and Wellness Center, 530-752-2349, or their primary care provider before going in. “This will allow us to provide you with information on your illness, and to plan for your visit to the clinic, if needed,” Schorzman said in a coronavirus update posted Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff should contact their primary care providers for instructions.</p>\n<p>Schorzman’s update also includes an FAQ. It includes this note: Healthy students should not stay home for fear of catching an infection in class.</p>\n<p>Human-to-human transmission</p>\n<p>Marsh's memo today to staff at UC Davis Health came one day after the CDC confirmed the first instance of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the United States, in Chicago. The case, Marsh said, was “not surprising, given what we know about the disease.”</p>\n<p>He said the case involved people in close contact with each other: a husband and wife. The wife recently returned from Wuhan. Not surprisingly, her husband contracted the disease from her.</p>\n<p>“That type of transmission is exactly what we would expect with any coronavirus: When someone who is sick breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes in the vicinity of others, their respiratory droplets can carry the virus toward other people, or onto surfaces such as doorknobs and tables,” Marsh said.</p>\n<p>“It’s all the more reason to practice good hand hygiene and flu prevention techniques. Washing our hands and covering our coughs cannot be done often enough, especially during flu season.”</p>\n<p>Marsh said UC Davis Health is well prepared for coronavirus and “determined to maintain a safe workplace and quality care environment for everyone.”</p>\n<p>He told employees a special coronavirus planning group is meeting twice a week, tasked with ensuring care teams and clinics have all the resources they need.</p>\n<p>“I remain hopeful that the coronavirus here in the U.S. will not become anything like it has overseas,” he told staff. “Your training and professionalism mean that our community and region can be assured that UC Davis Health is prepared for everything.”</p>\n<p>Follow Dateline UC Davis on Twitter.</p>","id":"ac2fb326-a34e-5f86-ab1f-88ade50d1447","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucdavis/2020-04-08-23_21_46/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coronavirus: Working Remotely, Beyond April 7"}}},{"node":{"html":"<ul>\n<li>Students should remain at home or elsewhere in accordance with state and federal guidelines. <a href=\"https://reslife.uconn.edu/\">Residential Life</a> will communicate directly to students as to how and when belongings can be retrieved.

We apologize, and share your disappointment.</p>\n<p>If you are among those students, your possessions will remain in your locked room until the university is fully reopened and relevant state directives have been lifted, hopefully later this spring.</p>\n<p>However, with circumstances changing quickly, the state might need more space in UConn’s residence halls in coming days or weeks. In those situations, we would need to clear your room, with a professional company packing and storing your belongings until they can be returned.</p>\n<p>This is already the case for students in Buckley and Sprague halls, whose items will be packed and stored as the state takes over the space. Rooms also will be packed up in Charter Oak and part of Shippee so remaining students at Buckley and Shippee can be relocated there.</p>\n<p>It is also occurring in Stamford, where 900 Washington Blvd. will be turned over to state use and unoccupied rooms will be packed up. Students still living there will be moved to the other two student housing properties nearby, where some rooms might also need to be packed up to accommodate the consolidation.</p>\n<p>We are committed to handling your belongings responsibly and respectfully. And while we do not yet know if and when the state might need to use additional UConn residence halls, we will keep you updated as circumstances evolve.<br>\nAgain, we are very sorry that you are being inconvenienced by this necessary and unavoidable<br>\ncircumstance. Although it benefits the greater good and is critical to the state’s efforts to address<br>\nthe pandemic, we understand that it may add to your unease during these unusual times.<br>\nThe university looks forward to welcoming you and your fellow Huskies back to our campuses<br>\nas soon as we can, and we wish good health to you and your loved ones.</p>","id":"d7c5b4c3-2c44-5ec2-9ba7-1e41d8eeb3d2","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-uconn/2020-04-10-14_44_20/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Message to Residential Students at Storrs and Stamford, Student Housing"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>UConn trustees moved on Wednesday, March 25, to authorize <a href=\"https://today.uconn.edu/2020/03/uconn-provide-refunds-unused-housing-dining-plans/\">pro-rated housing and dining cost refunds</a> for students who had to leave the university as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

With registration now upon us, and being aware of the advanced planning that both faculty and students must make to participate in summer session classes, UCR and other UC campuses must decide now whether to continue remote instruction into summer.</p>\n<p>After consulting with campus leadership, including the Chair and Vice Chair of the Academic Senate, and checking in with colleagues at other UC campuses, we have decided to continue remote instruction through summer 2020.</p>\n<p>Making this decision now will enable students to register for classes with the knowledge they need to make related plans for summer, including residential and employment decisions, and will give faculty substantial lead time to plan for remote instruction. We believe this is the best way to support our students after spring quarter, especially those whose progress to degree may be affected by their ability to access summer courses.</p>\n<p>Summer Sessions will be working with the academic departments during the next week to update the summer schedule of classes to accommodate remote instruction.</p>","id":"7a4db9a1-880e-5144-8f73-456f86891dea","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucr/2020-04-08-23_34_25/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Remote instruction continuing for UCR Summer Sessions"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://ucr.benchurl.com/c/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Dear UCR Student,</p>\n<p>As we continue to navigate the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges each of you might be feeling at this time, UCR will be implementing additional changes to the spring 2020 late payment penalties and additional fees.

Delinquent Holds for outstanding charges from a previous quarter will remain in place. Course material fees will be adjusted for courses that, in this new learning environment, do not require the equipment or other educational resources traditionally covered by the fee. Of the approximately 280 course material fees typically assessed, 8 courses will retain these fees because the educational resources will still be provided to support the student-learning experience. Please allow the first week of instruction for these adjustments to be made to your student account. The Registrar’s website will be updated to reflect which course material fees remain in effect for spring.

This change has been nothing short of remarkable; and while there will be some bumps along the way, our campus community’s resiliency has helped make this unprecedented change possible.</p>\n<p>Despite our present circumstances, UCR will not be taking any shortcuts with the change to remote instruction: the same standards that define UCR’s excellence will continue during these challenging times, and all of us remain focused on your continued academic progress. Your faculty is working around the clock to prepare and adjust spring quarter courses, while remaining committed to their groundbreaking research activities. In fact, several faculty members and students in the School of Medicine and across the university are on the frontlines treating patients and advancing research in the fight against the novel coronavirus.</p>\n<p>We recognize that you have many questions and concerns as you head into the spring quarter, and we hope to address many of them below.</p>\n<p>Tuition and Fees</p>\n<p>We have been asked if spring quarter tuition and fees will be adjusted, so we write to clarify the University of California’s approach. Consistent with this letter issued by the UC Office of the President, all tuition and fees remain unchanged for students enrolled during spring quarter.</p>\n<p>We recognize there are continued concerns about campus-based fees during this period of uncertainty. While the current situation is unprecedented, students enrolled in off-campus instructional programs such as the Education Abroad Program or UCDC, for example, are assessed campus-based fees even if they are not physically present on the campus. Thus, remote instruction is determined to be analogous to those off-campus arrangements.</p>\n<p>Separate from the tuition and fees described above, UCR is reviewing course materials and services fees to determine if these can be waived for the spring quarter. We plan to finalize those decisions next week so student billing can be appropriately adjusted.</p>\n<p>Faculty and Teaching Assistants</p>\n<p>Faculty members and TAs will hold virtual office hours and implement a range of approaches that foster communication and promote opportunities for student/faculty collaboration that are the heart of the academy. While the “classroom experience” will be different this spring, your instructors will prioritize academic enrichment; meaningful interaction, connections, and mentorship; and a strong focus on academic rigor. Additionally, academic support services such as tutoring and supplemental instruction will remain available through the spring quarter.</p>\n<p>Laboratories and Performance-Based Courses</p>\n<p>Developing remote laboratories and performance-based courses is a significant challenge, and faculty members are working with campus experts to satisfy learning objectives. We are consulting with peer universities across the nation to apply best practices in planning remote labs and courses. Each course will develop the academic and technical skills necessary for the growth and development of our students.</p>\n<p>Instructional Quality</p>\n<p>We are making substantial new investments in technology and other tools to support remote learning at a scale never seen before at UC and to ensure that the courses you take in spring quarter will achieve their learning objectives, as they would in any other quarter. The same UCR faculty, lecturers and teaching assistants who deliver in-person instruction will evaluate your work in spring 2020.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Housing and Other Services</p>\n<p>Consistent with state and county public health orders, we strongly encourage students to return home, if it is safe to do so. We understand that some of you must remain on campus for various reasons. You are welcome to stay and we will continue to provide services in a modified manner to protect healthy and safety.</p>\n<p>Student Health, Counseling and Psychological Services, R’Pantry, and other functions remain available for all students even through the closure.</p>\n<p>Financial Aid</p>\n<p>The Office of Financial Aid remains committed to supporting you during the spring quarter. The office will continue its operations remotely and is available to serve students by email. If you make any changes to your course schedule or living arrangements, you may submit a revision request in R’Web for your spring financial aid package to be adjusted accordingly.</p>\n<p>Finally, we will continue to monitor conditions to ensure that every student has the ability to persist under these challenging and unprecedented circumstances, and we will share further adjustments as information becomes available. In the meantime, please take care of yourselves and stay healthy.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Kim A. Wilcox</p>\n<p>Chancellor</p>\n<p>Thomas M.

You have all worked tirelessly to successfully make the transition to remote learning and have done so quickly to maintain our students’ academic progress.</p>\n<p>We thank the wonderful faculty, students, and staff who have already skillfully and immediately disabled such presence in real time as it occurs.

The disappearance of our community and the realization that we will miss all the opportunities to spend time with our students, staff, and faculty this spring quarter is still difficult to accept. As Dilling and I walk alone through the picturesque pathways of our once bustling campus, we are now feeling the silence and the absence of the commotion that characterize discovery and learning.</p>\n<p>But we are also lifted by hope and the understanding that our community is dynamic, innovative, and compassionate, especially when facing a challenge. It is clear that much has already changed and that things will continue to change, but if we hold fast to our goals, we can achieve them, even if it means navigating frustrating detours or exploring unexpected new paths.</p>\n<p>Following Governor Newsom’s recent stay-at-home order and following consultation with students, faculty, and our academic deans, we have made the difficult decision to postpone our annual commencement ceremonies, which were scheduled to take place in June.</p>\n<p>Every year we eagerly await gathering for this time-honored tradition, and in light of this decision, we are committed to:</p>\n<p>• Holding an in-person ceremony when it is safe to do so — welcoming all of our 2020 graduates and their families back to our campus so that we can celebrate their numerous accomplishments together.</p>\n<p>• Holding a virtual ceremony on the second weekend of June that will allow us to recognize the achievements of our graduating students at the end of our spring quarter.</p>\n<p>We know that this decision is a tremendous disappointment to our graduates, who for years have devoted themselves to reaching this milestone and have looked forward with great anticipation to the celebration that would mark their academic accomplishment. And we know it is just as disappointing to the families and friends who have supported our students in their scholarly endeavors, and for whom commencement represents a shared and equally important achievement.</p>\n<p>It is also a disappointment for us — the faculty and staff who have made the journeys of our students our own. We take pride in watching each and every graduate participate in all the pomp and circumstance of a commencement ceremony — walking across the stage in cap and gown as their names are read, to receive their diploma or to be hooded, and to be greeted by their faculty, mentors, and myself.</p>\n<p>While some may believe our situation will abate within a few months, the public health information we are receiving suggests the rapid and evolving nature of COVID-19 makes the risk to our community too great to allow large gatherings such as our UC Santa Barbara Commencement.</p>\n<p>From our consultation with students and parents, and from the countless messages we have received, we are reminded just how important commencement is for our students and their families. It is just as important to us. Each of our graduates is special and carries a unique story of triumph. This is why we thought it necessary to share our current thinking with our community now, and to affirm our commitment to hosting an event on campus when the situation allows.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for standing alongside us as we take steps to respond to this unprecedented situation. We look forward to the time when our campus life can return to the vibrant experience we’ve all come to expect and love at UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Henry T.

In these challenging times, we appreciate and thank everyone for taking a community-minded approach.</p>\n<p>Our health experts advise that the COVID-19 pandemic should not be viewed as a regular cold, or even as a new kind of flu. The virus can cause severe disease, and presents a high risk of mortality, particularly among the aging and chronically ill. Even if a young adult gets a mild form of the disease, it can be transmitted to parents or grandparents or others in the community in whom the disease can be deadly. Many cases require hospitalization, and the system can rapidly become overwhelmed. We urgently ask everyone to carefully consider their own vulnerability and that of those around them. Please continue to be aware and keep informed.</p>\n<p>By working together and being community minded, we can help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in a way that will help our medical community in responding to this evolving crisis. Our sister UC campuses and numerous other universities across the country are taking similar action, which is in line with recommendations of many health experts regarding social distancing in order to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>To expand on the earlier guidance from the COVID-19 Response Working Group (members listed below), we want to be more clear:</p>\n<p>• By not coming back to campus after travel, our students can play a significant and critical role in helping slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. We are asking students who are traveling for spring break to stay away from campus for at least the month of April. We are asking those students who plan to stay on campus for April not to travel during spring break.</p>\n<p>• No student will be required to attend in-person lectures or seminars during the month of April. We are asking our colleagues to be flexible in making accommodations at all levels.</p>\n<p>• Students who are planning to leave campus will receive the same education as those who stay and will not be disadvantaged for remaining away. We are continuing to work out issues related to work-study, financial aid, housing, and dining so that none of our students are disadvantaged by these changes. Please know that responding to all the different individual cases in order to make accommodations will take time.</p>\n<p>• Due to the shift from in-person final exams to on-line and other alternatives, we are extending the deadline for winter grades by one week to 11:59PM, Tuesday, March 31, 2020. To minimize the impact on our students, we urge those who can, to please submit grades by the original deadline or as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>• The campus will remain open and operational in order to accommodate our students who need to stay on campus and to continue critical research activities. Keeping the campus operational and achieving the highest standards of remote instruction cannot be accomplished without our dedicated staff and faculty. We will follow UCOP’s guidance in order to protect their health and well-being while asking managers to exercise maximum flexibility.</p>\n<p>We understand how the decision to move toward remote instruction and limiting the presence of our students on campus has created a great deal of uncertainty not only for our students, but also for our faculty, staff, parents, and visitors to our campus. We deeply apologize for the hardships and the increased anxiety this disruption is causing for all of us. We did not make the decision lightly. It was driven by our responsibility to protect the health and well-being of our students and their families, as well as that of our dedicated staff and faculty.</p>\n<p>We know this decision calls on many of us to sacrifice our own personal interests in service to the greater well-being of our campus community, as well as Isla Vista, Goleta, Santa Barbara, and the families of our students, faculty, and staff.</p>\n<p>This transition will be difficult. It will take time. An institution as complex and decentralized as a university campus, especially one as committed to shared governance as UC Santa Barbara, cannot change in one day or even in one week. What we can do, however, is work tirelessly to implement the changes, to develop new policies, and to provide information and updates through this challenging transition. We will listen to and appreciate the concerns raised by our community so we can understand the hardships and disruptions, and find ways to address and mitigate them wherever possible.</p>\n<p>To our faculty and teaching community, please know that we are working to support your efforts in rapidly adjusting to new instructional modalities.</p>\n<p>For our students and parents, please know that our entire faculty, our instructors, and our staff are working around the clock to answer your questions (see FAQs here), address your concerns, and ensure that we can continue to maintain the highest educational standards despite the threat posed and disruption caused by COVID-19.</p>\n<p>For our staff, who provide the foundational support for our mission of education, research, and service, please know that we remain committed to keeping our community safe and to being as accommodating as possible, with maximum flexibility, during this unprecedented set of circumstances.</p>\n<p>We have experienced the tremendous capacity of our community to overcome hardship, natural disaster, and tragedy. We know our community is compassionate, supportive, and resilient. We know our community embraces a challenge, and welcomes innovation and change. We are proud of the strengths of our UC Santa Barbara community. I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary efforts being made by our staff, our faculty, and our students.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Henry T.

We know that many of these recommendations will be challenging to implement, but it is important that we take the necessary steps now to respond to the rapidly evolving situation, despite the fact that no cases have been reported on campus or in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Our campus will be transitioning to remote instruction for the remainder of Winter Quarter and the start of the Spring Quarter through at least the end of April. Given our campus’s transition to remote instruction and the possibility of additional travel disruptions and restrictions, we are recommending that all undergraduate students traveling for spring break be prepared for the possibility of remaining away from campus through the month of April. We understand that graduate students have different academic commitments and recommend that they consult with their advisors and departments.</p>\n<p>The campus will remain open and operational, including Housing and Dining, which will continue normal operations.</p>\n<p>Based on advice from the leading health experts, the following actions are necessary to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Instruction</p>\n<p>• Effective March 11, 2020, for the remainder of Winter Quarter, we strongly recommend that instructors make alternative arrangements for in-person classes and for final exams. In addition to alternative assignments, such as remote exams, instructors may make use of Proctor U for online exams. Instructors will be communicating directly with their students with more specific details.</p>\n<p>• To the extent possible, instructors and departments should make plans to shift Spring Quarter classes from in-person formats to remote formats, using alternative modalities, at least through the month of April.</p>\n<p>• Students who remain on campus through the break and during the month of April will also be receiving instruction remotely, and must also be prepared for limited on-campus activities and services. More detailed guidance and information about services for students will follow in subsequent communications.</p>\n<p>• Additional guidelines and information will be sent to instructors to assist with this transition.</p>\n<p>Our COVID-19 Response Working Group will continue to consult and evaluate the evolving situation in the coming days and weeks in order to make additional recommendations related to instruction for the Spring Quarter. We know that this transition is not going to be easy and we will all need to be flexible.</p>\n<p>Travel</p>\n<p>We are recommending against all non-essential business travel, international and domestic, for UC Santa Barbara employees through the end of April. This guidance is in addition to current UC systemwide restrictions already in place to CDC Level 3 (widespread community transmission) and Level 2 (sustained community transmission) countries.</p>\n<p>With spring break approaching, we also encourage our faculty, staff, and students to carefully consider the risks associated with travel, both international and domestic. All personal international travel is strongly discouraged and we urge extreme caution and judgement for your personal domestic travel.</p>\n<p>Events</p>\n<p>While no UC systemwide restrictions on large events or mass gatherings have been implemented at this time, the COVID-19 Response Working Group recommends that campus groups strongly consider postponing, canceling, or rescheduling crowded on-campus events.</p>\n<p>The Athletics Department will be moving to “fan-less” events.</p>\n<p>The CDC provides guidance on mass gatherings and large events.</p>\n<p>Working Remotely and Staff Leave Policy</p>\n<p>We urge managers to use maximum flexibility in working with members of our staff in order to address challenges caused by COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The Office of the President has enacted temporary emergency leave policies in anticipation of potential scenarios. The Working Group recommends that managers work with employees to explore opportunities to work remotely when job duties permit. Highlights of the policy are below and the full guidelines can be found online.</p>\n<p>• Managers may designate certain employees to work from home. If employees are designated to work from home, it will be considered paid work status.</p>\n<p>• Employees unable to work due to their own or a family member’s COVID-19 illness should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if there are no available leave balances, the University will provide up to 14 days paid administrative leave to cover the absence.</p>\n<p>• Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID-l9 day care or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if operationally feasible; if remote work is not operationally feasible, employees may use available leave balances including sick leave.</p>\n<p>I would once again like to take this opportunity to express the great appreciation we all feel to be members of this dedicated community.</p>\n<p>Our most valuable resource at UC Santa Barbara is our people — our staff, our faculty, our students, and our alumni. I want to express my sincere thanks to all as we work together to protect and support our community and meet the challenges related to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Henry T.

A student who left campus on Tuesday, March 17, for spring break has reported testing positive for COVID-19. During the break, the student reported experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Following two weeks of self-quarantine and over a week with no symptoms, the student returned to campus on Friday, April 3, for about two hours in order to remove personal belongings from their room in Santa Cruz Residence Hall. After returning home, the student received notice that they tested positive.</p>\n<p>The student’s visit to campus on April 3 was brief, and they reported not interacting with or coming into contact with anyone from our campus. The student, whose roommates left campus prior to spring break, reported spending time in their residence only, wearing a face covering, diligently practicing social distancing, washing and sanitizing hands frequently, and touching only their own personal belongings. We are cleaning and sanitizing both the student’s room and the common areas, and we have contacted public health officials.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County public health officials and our campus health experts, the risk of any exposure to members of our campus community from this student’s brief visit is extremely low.</p>\n<p>Our thoughts and warm wishes are with our student and their family, and we are grateful to them for following health and safety protocols that are in place to protect our community.</p>\n<p>This student case further illustrates the critical importance of social distancing, frequent hand washing, and face coverings. We want to make sure our campus community is aware of the new recommendations regarding the use of cloth face coverings. These are issued by the Centers for Disease Control, the California Department of Public Health, and our own Santa Barbara County Public Health officials.</p>\n<p>Our campus health experts also are now recommending face coverings for people who come to campus to perform essential university functions. Face coverings can keep people who have the virus but are asymptomatic from spreading it to others. Evidence shows that covering the mouth and nose can be effective in reducing the release of airborne respiratory droplets that can infect others.</p>\n<p>The new guidance recommends bandannas, scarves, and simple homemade cloth versions as coverings for the general public. Health experts continue to stress the need to maintain the much-needed supply of N-95 and surgical masks for doctors, nurses, and other frontline personnel.</p>\n<p>We will continue to send updates to our campus community or post updates to our COVID-19 website as information becomes available.</p>\n<p>And as we navigate these difficult times, I hope you will continue to take care of yourselves and each other. Our strength, both individually and collectively, is rooted in our support for one another.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Henry T.

These adjustments to your housing and dining charges may result in increased financial aid refunds for financial aid recipients (see the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office message of <a href=\"https://financialaid.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/march-18-financial-aid-and-covid-19-email.html\">March 18</a> and the linked <a href=\"https://financialaid.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/current-students.html\">COVID-19 website</a>).</p>\n<p>The processing of housing and dining credits will be on-going throughout the next few weeks. Staff in Financial Aid are working in parallel, adjusting aid as quickly as possible, with some student financial aid refunds delayed as work proceeds. In spite of these efforts, it is anticipated there will be some students who will see multiple financial aid refunds or receive additional billing due to the processing timeline. As compared to the normal spring budget for students commuting from home or living with parents, the new remote student <a href=\"https://financialaid.ucsc.edu/cost-to-attend/undergraduate-remote.html\">budget</a> includes an additional  ** <em>$2,000</em>**. The additional budget items are intended to address expenses such as housing, food,  <em>technology setup for remote instruction</em> , medical and other costs you may incur during the spring term.</p>\n<p>Students may receive financial aid refunds, through direct deposit or checks from Student Business Services, when the total accepted aid is greater than expenses billed by the campus (such as for tuition and fees, on-campus housing and dining, and USHIP). For on-campus students, such financial aid refunds may be modest or may not exist. Changing to the new remote student budget may change your financial aid refund.</p>\n<p>For students who normally receive financial aid refunds, the amounts will vary depending upon accepted aid and remaining charges on the student account. An example of the possible change in refunded amounts for a $0 Expected Family Contribution (EFC) California (CA) Resident student is below:</p>\n<p><em>$0 EFC CA Resident, On-Campus Triple Room 5-day meal plan with USHIP</em></p>\n<p>Total Spring Direct Cost/Billing: $10,332<br>\nTotal Spring Aid : $10,332 (includes $1,167 loan)<br>\nEstimated Spring Refund $ 0</p>\n<p><em>$0 EFC CA Resident, Remote Instruction with USHIP</em></p>\n<p>Total Spring Direct Cost/Billing: $5,670<br>\nTotal Spring Aid : $9,145 (includes $1,167 loan)<br>\nEstimated Spring Refund  ** <em>$ 3,475</em>**</p>\n<p>Spring disbursement of financial aid is scheduled for March 23, with direct deposit refunds on March 25 and paper check processing occurring on March 31. While our offices are working as quickly as possible to resolve financial aid and housing adjustments, there may continue to be activity on your account in the following weeks.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for your patience,</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://financialaid.ucsc.edu/\">Financial Aid and Scholarships Office</a></p>","id":"f2ee13dd-7680-5795-ad7d-659a49d51042","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucsc/2020-04-09-14_27_43/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Updates on COVID-19 (coronavirus)"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/themes/ucsbweb/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>March 14, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Members of Our Campus Community,</p>\n<p>I would like to acknowledge what a challenging time this has been for all of us.

As the situation has continued to evolve, we have made the difficult decision, in consultation with many of our students, faculty, and staff, to extend remote instruction through the entire spring quarter and to end all in-person instruction.</p>\n<p>We are asking instructors, who are faced with the daunting task of adjusting to remote instruction, to extend their planning through the spring quarter. We know that there will be specific courses that cannot be taught effectively in remote formats. Faculty and departments will have to exercise maximum flexibility in these unique circumstances.</p>\n<p>We will continue to work to be as accommodating as possible in an attempt to make sure all of our students are able to receive the courses they need to fulfill requirements. However, given the extraordinary circumstances that we are facing, there will be individual challenges among students, faculty, and staff that must be addressed. We will share additional guidance as soon as it is developed.</p>\n<p>While we know how disappointing this situation is, especially for our graduating students, social distancing and lowering the density on campus is the best way to mitigate the spread and impact of COVID-19, according to our health experts.</p>\n<p>Housing</p>\n<p>With these changes and in order to lower the density on campus, we are also urging students who can safely leave to do so and to take all of their personal items from their university-owned housing. We have a small window to take proactive steps to protect our community, and we are asking everyone to do their best and to be community-minded. Instructions related to moving out of campus housing will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>Housing and dining refunds have been addressed in guidance sent directly to students to help with decisions for the coming spring quarter. Related questions can be directed to housinginfo@housing.ucsb.edu or 805-893-4371.</p>\n<p>We are also reviewing options related to campus-based fees as well as financial aid considerations, and will be communicating separately by the end of next week with students and parents as new policy is developed.</p>\n<p>Our campus remains open and operational in order to accommodate our students who need to stay and to continue with our research mission. We will do our best to continue to offer roles to our student employees, although the work may be modified based on campus needs.</p>\n<p>Staff</p>\n<p>We continue to urge managers to exercise maximum flexibility in working with members of our staff, prioritizing the health and well-being of our employees. We know that the K-12 school closures across the region have only added to the pressure on our community. Our offices of Administrative Services and Human Resources yesterday issued more detailed guidance preparing for increasing social distancing through remote work. Staff should consult with their managers.</p>\n<p>Our COVID-19 Response Working Group continues to convene daily to monitor the evolving situation. I have also spent many hours talking with and listening to our students, staff, and faculty across campus. Their invaluable thoughts and ideas have made a great impact on the decisions we have been making. We so value the input of each of our community members.</p>\n<p>We greatly appreciate your flexibility and understanding as we navigate this challenging time together. Thank you for all you do to support and care for our UC Santa Barbara family.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Henry T. Yang</p>\n<p>Chancellor</p>\n<p>COVID-19 Response Working Group Rationale</p>\n<p>In explaining the basis for our recommendations, we ask that you understand the gravity of this threat and remain calm. Our recommendations are based on the evidence, and the evidence strongly suggests that we can get this pandemic under control if we follow the guidelines.</p>\n<p>To understand the gravity of the situation, consider how rapidly the virus spreads. An approximate rate of spread is doubling every two days. If one person is positive for the virus, that means in one month there will be thousands of cases if no measures are taken. If in the more likely case a group of people are infected at once, say 10 people, in one month we will have tens of thousands of cases. Here are some concrete examples:</p>\n<p>Based on the current situation in other regions of the world, it is estimated that if drastic measures are not taken early to prevent transmission, 40-70% of the U.S. population will be infected within 12 to 18 months. In Italy, two weeks ago there were 300 cases, one week ago there were 2,500 cases, and today there are over 21,000 cases. In the U.S., two weeks ago we had fewer than 100 cases, one week ago we had over 400 cases, and today we have close to 2,500 cases and 51 confirmed deaths. If the infection continues as it is, next week we will have tens of thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths. The risk of severe disease and fatality is elevated in high-risk populations – individuals over 65 and those with underlying conditions. There are no vaccines or treatments available at this moment for the general population. If the infection continues unrestrained, the impact of COVID-19 in our healthcare system will be severe.</p>\n<p>The current situation is serious, and we need to make adjustments to our normal routines. We need to act fast. In other regions of the world, like Hong Kong and Singapore, where early precautionary measures were taken, the mortality rate is as low as 0.5%. In places where the measures were adopted later, the reported mortality rate is between 3-10%. Time is of the essence. The virus is transmitted by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. Symptoms appear between 2 to 14 days after exposure. There is an unknown fraction of the population that shows mild or no symptoms.</p>\n<p>Even if you do not develop severe disease or show symptoms, you can still transmit the virus to other people. We need to work together to prevent widespread transmission in our community. These are some of the measures we need to take as a community:</p>","id":"5e711ea7-f9d5-5d79-882f-5620dc5ad700","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-ucsb/2020-04-08-23_22_41/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 Response Update and New Spring Quarter Guidance"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>We are all working hard to adapt to the greater Bay Area and statewide shelter-in-place directives issued this week. UC Santa Cruz employees are permitted by these orders to continue to come to work to carry out the university's essential functions. We write to provide clarity regarding who should and should not be coming to work <strong>at all campus locations</strong> to perform duties related to remote instruction and research consistent with the procedures that the campus has now established for providing remote learning and essential research continuity. This directive supersedes all earlier communications.</p>\n<p>Please read through the detailed information below.  <strong>These are campus directives that everyone in our research and teaching communities must follow. They are not guidelines.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Coverage of this directive</strong></p>\n<p>This message is a formal employment directive issued by the interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services, and the Vice Chancellor for Research, and it applies to all employees and faculty including visiting scholars and visiting student researchers who are engaged in instruction and research. This directive applies to research and instructional faculty, staff and students; it does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is otherwise determined to be essential. </p>\n<p>**Remote instruction  **</p>\n<p>Faculty, graduate students (in their capacity as TAs and GSIs), and staff may come to the campus only to engage in and directly support the delivery of remote learning instruction (and the limited, specific preparation necessary for such instruction) that cannot be accomplished from home. <strong>We have suspended our Webcast service and it will not be available during the spring quarter. Classrooms will not be available for the preparation or execution of remote instruction.</strong> Instructors, teaching assistants, and the staff who support them in remote instruction may use private offices to access the internet for the purpose of delivery of remote learning. Access to, and the use of, private offices must conform to standards of social distancing. </p>\n<p>In cases where remote instruction is possible only with the use of campus facilities, approval must be obtained from department chairs and the relevant dean. Please note that exemptions for use of specialized facilities will be limited to a small number of previously determined lab and studio courses. With the exception of private offices, all uses of campus facilities for the facilitation of remote instruction must be approved in advance and must incorporate mandated standards of social distancing. For approval, please contact your department chair, college provost or program director, who will facilitate approval with the dean. </p>\n<p>As you make the change to fully remote instruction, first visit our <a href=\"https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/\">Keep Teaching</a> website to take advantage of the teaching resources, technical information and guidance, and virtual consultation services. Resources and consultation are available to support you as you transition to a fully remote environment. Group and individual consultation services can be scheduled by contacting <a href=\"mailto:citl@ucsc.edu\">citl@ucsc.edu</a> or <a href=\"mailto:help@ucsc.edu\">help@ucsc.edu</a>. </p>\n<p>**Research  **</p>\n<p><strong>Principal investigators (PIs) and their research groups/staff may only engage in essential on-campus research continuity activities with the specific approval of the Vice Chancellor for Research.</strong> See the <a href=\"https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/temp-cessation-of-non-essential-on-campus-research-operations.html\">March 17 message</a> for further details. PIs will be notified about approvals on a rolling basis. </p>\n<p>No one supporting the campus research enterprise may come to campus for any purpose without approval, nor may approved researchers support or engage in activities that have not been explicitly approved by the VCR. If you are being inappropriately pressured to come to your workplace, contact your department chair, Scott Brandt, Vice Chancellor for Research (<a href=\"mailto:vcr@ucsc.edu\">vcr@ucsc.edu</a>), or Quentin Williams, acting Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies (<a href=\"mailto:qwilliam@ucsc.edu\">qwilliam@ucsc.edu</a>). </p>\n<p><strong>Classroom access</strong></p>\n<p>Classrooms will be locked and remain locked through the spring quarter. Some buildings will be locked with access limited to key-card holders. Building managers will communicate information regarding building closure to occupants.</p>\n<p>The campus will shift to having all facilities placed in after-hours security mode. This means that for all sites including the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, Westside Research Park at 2300 Delaware, UCO-Lick at Mount Hamilton, Scotts Valley Center, and Silicon Valley Center, doors will be locked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and access to the facility will be limited to those essential employees who require access and have key/electronic access. This action reflects the need to adequately secure the campus through the period of the county and state directive to shelter in place and may be extended for public safety purposes. </p>\n<p><strong>When working from home has limitations</strong></p>\n<p>Other than the exceptions listed above, no employee, graduate student or instructor supporting instruction or research may decide to come to their campus office to work. Beyond those work environment needs dictated by a responsibility to provide remote instruction, inadequate home internet or home conditions that are not conducive to efficient work are not allowed reasons to come to campus. The university understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. Instructors and staff who need equipment to work from home should request support from their supervisor or department chair. </p>\n<p><strong>A word of thanks</strong></p>\n<p>We know that a number of changes have gone into effect quickly and during an already enormously stressful time. We want to thank you for your support and the considerable work of all members of our community that we know is going into making these transitions.

These measures will help mitigate some of the extraordinary challenges students and their families face in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>“We want to help alleviate the tremendous disruption and anxiety that is already overwhelming prospective students due to COVID-19,” said John A. Pérez, chair of the Board of Regents, the governing board for UC. “By removing artificial barriers and decreasing stressors – including suspending the use of the SAT – for this unprecedented moment in time, we hope there will be less worry for our future students.”</p>\n<p>“The COVID-19 outbreak is a disaster of historic proportions disrupting every aspect of our lives, including education for high school students, among others,” said University of California President Janet Napolitano, who endorsed the changes. “The University’s flexibility at this crucial time will ensure prospective students aiming for UC get a full and fair shot — no matter their current challenges.”</p>\n<p>The global health crisis has forced the closure of high schools across the country and prompted sudden shifts to remote instruction. Some schools adopted “pass/fail” or “credit/no credit” grading instead of letter grades for A-G courses needed to qualify for UC admission. These measures had the potential to adversely affect not only the incoming freshman class, but all high school students seeking a UC education, making it challenging to meet University requirements. Meanwhile, K-12 standardized testing and college entrance exams have been cancelled, further thwarting student progress.</p>\n<p>In response, the Regents approved a series of critical, short-term measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suspending the letter grade requirement for A-G courses completed in winter/spring/summer 2020 for all students, including UC’s most recently admitted freshmen.</li>\n<li>Suspending the standardized test requirement for students applying for fall 2021 freshman admission.</li>\n<li>Providing that there will be no rescission of student admissions offers that result from students or schools missing official final transcript deadlines, and student retention of admission status through the first day of class until official documents are received by campuses.</li>\n<li>For transfer students, temporarily suspending the cap on the number of transferable units with “pass/no pass” grading applied toward the minimum 60 semester/90 quarter units required for junior standing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the University’s actions, the College Board recently announced changes to Advanced Placement (AP) exam content and formats for spring 2020. UC recognizes the effort that students have already applied in these challenging courses and will award UC credit for 2020 AP exams completed with scores of 3, 4 or 5, consistent with previous years. </p>\n<p>“The goal of these changes is to ensure a fair process that does not affect the life chances of students who, but for the coronavirus pandemic, would have become full-time students at the University of California,” said Kum-Kum Bhavnani, chair of the Academic Senate. The Senate exercises direct control over academic matters of central importance to UC and made the admissions recommendations to the Regents.</p>\n<p>UC requests submission of final transcripts by July 1.

Today we make Triton history as together we embark upon our very first virtual quarter. All courses and student experiences will be conducted remotely to stop the spread of coronavirus. Instructors and students are asked to become familiar with academic continuity tools and are invited to join UC San Diego’s workshops for remote teaching and learning at <a href=\"https://edtech.ucsd.edu/calendar/index.html\">https://edtech.ucsd.edu/calendar/index.html</a>.

Instructors and staff have been busy preparing for today, working to create a smooth transition to virtual formats. This quick turn-around means there will be bumps. We ask that everyone practice courtesy during the first two weeks of the quarter as we all find our bearings and adjust. We are all in this together, so be kind to one another, help each other over the phone and online when possible, and extend patience, empathy and compassion when experiencing hurdles. RETURNING FROM SPRING BREAK: PRECAUTIONS Campus residents returning from New York, New Jersey, or Louisiana are asked to self-isolate for 14 days until the concern about COVID-19 transmission is over, since the CDC reports that these areas are experiencing surges in virus transmission. Self-isolation means staying indoors and completely avoiding contact with other people for the full 14-day period. Self-isolation may require a temporary move to another space on campus. Housing and Dining Services will be providing meal delivery service for students with a meal plan during self-isolation. Any student returning to on-campus housing from these three locations should log in to the Housing Portal at <a href=\"https://hdh.ucsd.edu/housing/currentresidents/pages/\">https://hdh.ucsd.edu/housing/currentresidents/pages/</a> and complete the return form. STAY-AT-HOME ORDER &#x26; STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT California is under a “stay-at-home” executive order issued by Governor Gavin Newsom. This means going out for purposes other than ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES is a fineable act with a $1,000 fine or up to six months in jail according to San Diego County Sheriff William Gore. Examples of essential activities are medical appointments, pharmacy visits, or quick trips to secure groceries and necessary supplies. If you have to leave your residence for essential activities, please observe strict social distancing. The objective of social distancing is to reduce the probability of contact between persons carrying an infection, and others who are not infected, so as to minimize disease transmission. Provide six feet between you and anyone else you may come into contact with. “Flattening the curve” and maintaining the health and wellbeing of our community is everyone’s responsibility. With this in mind, we want to be transparent that any failure to comply with self-quarantine or related orders risks the health and safety of our community. As such, it may violate the Student Conduct Code with respect to Section VII (P) Failure to Comply, and Section VII (H) Health &#x26; Safety, and will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for follow-up. OUR PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY IN THE ONLINE CLASSROOM Our goal is to deliver the best educational experience possible, even under these difficult conditions. Observing our Principles of Community (<a href=\"https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html\">https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html</a>) in the virtual classroom environment will help us to create and maintain a positive and vibrant online learning community. Recognize and take into consideration that our richly diverse cultures and life experiences will influence our online engagement. Treat each other with respect and the dignity we all deserve. If you witness or experience online behavior that constitutes harassment or discrimination, remember to report it to the Office for the Prevention of Harassment &#x26; Discrimination (OPHD) at <a href=\"https://ophd.ucsd.edu\">https://ophd.ucsd.edu</a>. THANK YOU &#x26; BEST OF LUCK THIS QUARTER We would like to thank our hard-working staff, faculty, and student leaders for their incredible work to prepare us to have a spring quarter on time and in a new format. We appreciate all that you are doing to make our remote UC San Diego presence a strong Triton community. We are all Tritons. We are all in this together.

The Senate encourages instructors and instructional assistants to make clear that students should consult with their department and college advisors and financial aid advisors about their individual circumstances prior to any final election for their grading options or course schedule. The Academic Senate’s Educational Policy Committee (EPC) and Senate Council do not support approving any blanket exceptions that would require all undergraduate and graduate courses to be offered on a P/NP or S/U basis in Spring 2020. There is too much variation across disciplines, degrees, and student needs to advance a uniform policy. Below is a summary of actions approved by the Academic Senate as limited-term exceptions for Spring Quarter 2020, to temporarily change San Diego Senate Regulations relating to the Pass/No Pass (P/NP) and Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory (S/U) grades and temporarily extend the deadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses and changing a course grading option. These updates are also posted on the Academic Senate website: <a href=\"https://senate.ucsd.edu/COVID-19-Academic-Senate-Updates\">https://senate.ucsd.edu/COVID-19-Academic-Senate-Updates</a> 1. Pass/No Pass (P/NP) and Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades The Educational Policy Committee proposed, and Senate Council approved on March 19, 2020, the following exceptions to Senate Regulations related to P/NP and S/U grades in Spring 2020. These limited-term exceptions are intended to provide more flexibility to students who prefer taking courses on a P/NP or S/U basis. *A one-time exception to the San Diego Senate Regulation on the P/NP grade limit to exempt all P/NP courses taken during Spring 2020 from the 25% limit on the number of UCSD units that undergraduate students are allowed to complete on a P/NP basis. P/NP courses completed during Spring 2020 should be removed from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the percentage of courses taken on a pass/no pass basis. (San Diego Senate Regulation 500.D.1: <a href=\"https://go.ucsd.edu/2UaEoo2\">https://go.ucsd.edu/2UaEoo2</a>) *A one-time exception to San Diego Senate Regulations on P/NP and S/U grades to extend the deadlines for undergraduate and graduate students to register on a P/NP or S/U basis to the end of Week 10 in Spring 2020. (San Diego Senate Regulation 500.D.2: <a href=\"https://go.ucsd.edu/2UaEoo2\">https://go.ucsd.edu/2UaEoo2</a> and 500.E.6: <a href=\"https://go.ucsd.edu/39dBOla\">https://go.ucsd.edu/39dBOla</a>) The Undergraduate and Graduate Councils authorized allowing departments and colleges to offer undergraduate and graduate courses approved with the grading option of “Letter Grade Only” on a P/NP or S/U basis. This is a one-time exception for Spring 2020. Additional Information for Temporary Changes in Pass/No Pass and Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grading: *Senate Council supports allowing departments, programs, and colleges to relax letter grade requirements when possible. Many departments, programs, and colleges require courses applied to the major or general education requirements to be taken on a letter grade basis. It is up to the individual departments and colleges to decide whether to make an exception to their requirements and allow courses taken on a P/NP or S/U basis to apply towards major or degree requirements. To the extent possible, Senate Council strongly encourages departments, programs, and colleges to relax letter grade requirements for major courses, degree requirements, and prerequisites during Spring 2020 as such actions have the potential to mitigate stress and anxiety among students. *Instructors may not require that all students enroll in their course on a P/NP or S/U basis. Senate Council’s approval to relax the current requirements for enrollment on a P/NP and S/U basis is not a license for an instructor to require that all students must register for their course on a P/NP basis in a course that allows for letter or P/NP grading. These accommodations are being made to afford flexibility to students. 2. Deadlines for Adding, Dropping, and Withdrawing from Courses Senate Council approved on March 19, 2020 extending the following deadlines for adding and dropping courses and withdrawals as a limited-term exception for Spring 2020. These deadlines are being extended to support students and faculty adjusting to remote instruction. (San Diego Senate Regulation 501: <a href=\"https://go.ucsd.edu/2J5AOoK\">https://go.ucsd.edu/2J5AOoK</a>) *Deadline to Add a Course: The deadline for both undergraduate and graduate students to add a course is extended from the end of the second week of instruction to the end of the third week of instruction. *Deadline to Drop a Course without a W grade or Withdraw from the Quarter without W grades: The deadline for both undergraduate and graduate students to drop a course or all courses without a W grade on the transcript (i.e. a drop without a W grade) is extended from the end of the fourth week of instruction to the end of the fifth week of instruction. *Deadline to Drop a Course with a W grade or Withdraw from the Quarter with W grades: The deadline for undergraduate students to drop a course or all courses, with the assignment of a W grade(s), is extended from the end of the sixth week of instruction to the end of the seventh week of instruction. -The deadline for graduate students to drop a course or all courses, with the assignment of a W grade(s), is the end of the ninth week of instruction (no change). -An undergraduate student may petition to drop a course or withdraw from the University for emergency reasons after the end of the seventh week of instruction and before the end of the tenth week of instruction. For such petitions, approval may be granted by the appropriate provost for undergraduate students. -A graduate student may petition to drop a course or withdraw from the University for emergency reasons after the end of the ninth week of instruction and before the end of the tenth week of instruction. For such petitions, approval may be granted by the Dean of the Graduate Division. Additional Information for Temporary Changes to Enrollment Deadlines *As the quarter progresses, instructors are reminded to be mindful about providing feedback to students at multiple points during the quarter.

As Tritons, we must embody our principles of community and always practice empathy, compassion and kindness. Today, these principles direct us to look after not only our own wellbeing but also that of our campus and the San Diego community. Although this pandemic is one of the most difficult challenges we’ve faced as a society, we need to remember that viruses are not new. We have sufficient knowledge to understand how they are transmitted, how they reproduce and how they change. In time, we will also gain a better understanding of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Science will prevail. We simply need as much time and as many resources as possible to create a solution as efficiently as possible. The world needs your help to “buy more time” to allow this process to happen. How do you do this? Stop the transmission. Educate yourself. Internalize your role within your community. Closely follow health guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Learn all you can about the virus and the disease it causes in order to be prepared to act if you develop symptoms. Understand that you are an individual within a larger ecosystem. Without it, you cannot be an individual, and without the collection of individuals, the ecosystem cannot exist. STOP THE TRANSMISSION Today, our ecosystem, our society needs our help. It needs our thoughtful individual action and it needs it right now. Everyone—campus residents and those at remote locations—needs to commit to more aggressive physical distancing measures, not just for your own health and safety, but also for the health and safety of your friends, family, colleagues, neighbors and fellow community residents. Stay home or in your campus residence. Period. Do not engage in contact sports or activities that require sharing equipment or close contact. Limit personal interactions to phone or online formats. If you have to leave your residence for essential activities—medical appointments, pharmacy visits, or quick trips to buy groceries and necessary supplies—please maintain at least six feet between you and anyone else you may see while you are out. When you return to your residence, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and wipe down items purchased on your visit. Clean surfaces such as countertops, desks, and vanities regularly with household cleaner. Be sure also to clean highly touched surfaces such as phones, laptops, and other appliances. Laptops, keyboards, phones and other objects should not be shared with others unless they are thoroughly cleaned between users. EDUCATE YOURSELF: SARS-CoV-2 &#x26; COVID-19 While taking careful steps to stop the spread of the virus, it is important to continually learn about it. As our collective knowledge grows, we will identify other individual actions we can take to help. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold and pneumonia. COVID-19 is the disease caused by a novel coronavirus, identified as SARS-CoV-2. Not everyone who tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 develops COVID-19. Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild to moderate cold and flu-like symptoms. But some people—usually those with other medical complications—may develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia. Using available preliminary data, the World Health Organization estimates the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases of COVID-19 is approximately two weeks and is three to six weeks for patients with severe or critical disease. COVID-19 symptoms including fever, new cough, shortness of breath, and/or a persistent scratchy throat appear an average of five to six days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure, according to the CDC. If you are a student with these symptoms, contact Student Health Services at 858-534-3302 for instructions on how to proceed. Faculty and staff should contact their healthcare provider and/or primary care physician for further instructions. Visit the CDC website at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/</a> to stay up to date on our growing knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. CAMPUS UPDATE: CARING FOR OUR SICK Our society also needs our kindness right now. It needs all of us to care about those who are sick and those whose livelihoods have been adversely affected by the pandemic. UC San Diego’s first priority is the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, patients, and visitors. There are three students on campus who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. UC San Diego medical staff are currently contacting others who may have been in contact with these three students to determine next steps. In most but not all cases, testing and self-isolation are advised. Students living on campus who have been in contact with anyone (student or otherwise) who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or has developed COVID-19 should contact Student Health Services at 858-534-3300. To maintain confidentiality, and to be compliant with federal law (see Notice of Privacy Practices at <a href=\"https://wellness.ucsd.edu/studenthealth/about/HIPAA/Pages/default.aspx\">https://wellness.ucsd.edu/studenthealth/about/HIPAA/Pages/default.aspx</a>), we are not identifying isolated students nor their locations. Please keep in mind that just because someone is in self-isolation does not mean they have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or are ill with COVID-19. At some point in our lives, we all experience illness. It’s not a crime to be sick. We expect and hope all Tritons will practice empathy towards those in isolation awaiting test results, those who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 and those who have developed COVID-19. HELP FOR OUR COMMUNITY UC San Diego is also a public institution. As the region’s only academic medical center, we have a responsibility to care for members of our community especially in times of great need. UC San Diego has contracted with the County of San Diego to provide 350 rooms in a new campus housing building that is not currently occupied by students. If needed, one Nuevo East building will be used by the county as a creative medical treatment center that will accept “step-down” and low-level cases of COVID-19 to make room for more serious cases at area hospitals. Step-down cases are those who have recovered and passed the most severe stages of COVID-19. The center will also house doctors and nurses who will be responsible for patients receiving care at the facility. We are proud to be a community partner by providing a building they can use and manage for their purposes. The County has leased the entire building; UC San Diego will not be assigning any students to housing in that building for the duration of the lease. Campus residents who are in self-isolation awaiting test results or who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be housed in a separate building. Because all spring quarter classes and student experiences are being offered remotely, students who had been living on campus were offered refunds for housing if they moved out by March 31. This has yielded more than enough space on campus to ensure proper social distancing for those students remaining. THE ROAD AHEAD From the birth of our experimental campus, UC San Diego faculty, researchers, staff and students made a commitment to collaborate with knowledge builders inside and outside the institution to look deeper at the world around us in order to solve society’s most pressing issues. This poignant moment in history provides a true test of that commitment. We are meeting the challenge. We are facing this pandemic together, in collaboration, united for a common purpose. We are working with the world’s top minds to demystify this new virus and the disease it causes. We are doing our part to stop the spread of the virus. We are caring for our sick and providing needed resources to our community. I am proud of our response and prouder still of our performance under pressure. I offer special thanks to our staff, faculty and clinicians who have been instrumental in keeping the campus and our health system operational during this crisis. I also thank our residence life staff, custodial staff, dining hall staff, student health staff, emergency operations staff, executive policy group, Chancellor’s Cabinet, divisional deans and college provosts, faculty, students, and of course everyone in our medical centers. Your commitment and dedication to UC San Diego and each other are exemplary. The road ahead requires renewed commitment to community. This crisis will have a lasting, long-term effect for ourselves, our families, our friends and colleagues and countless people we do not know. I am grateful for everyone’s continued cooperation. Stay the course, and we will see an end to this crisis in due time. Thank you.</p>\n<p>Pradeep K.

Additional information will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>Courses</p>\n<p>Graduate students enrolled in coursework should follow the guidance being given to all UD students, and expect that classes will be delivered online starting March 30. Your instructors will provide further guidance about specific plans for their courses.</p>\n<p>Research</p>\n<p>All on-campus research has been restricted to essential activities. Building access will be provided only for the most critical needs (e.g., maintaining animals, critical cell cultures, unique reagents, essential equipment and materials). Graduate student researchers should work with their advisers or PI to plan efforts that will allow them to engage in research remotely. Find additional guidance and protocols—including access to Virtual Town Halls recorded on March 16 and 24—on this webpage.</p>\n<p>Teaching</p>\n<p>Students employed as teaching assistants should work with faculty in charge of their courses to plan how they will support online teaching. Both the Faculty Commons and the Center for Teaching and Assessment of Learning (CTAL) have excellent resources to support effective distance learning on their course continuity websites. CTAL will partner with Faculty Commons colleagues to offer bi-weekly conversations designed to help instructors and graduate assistants succeed in a digital learning environment. Specific details are forthcoming and will be published on the CTAL website. While specific assignments may change with the shift to online classes, expectations for TA workloads are the same, being limited to 20 hours per week, on average.</p>\n<p>Theses and Dissertations</p>\n<p>Please plan to have committee meetings and dissertation defenses remotely. You do not need to be on campus to submit a thesis or dissertation. Electronic signatures will be accepted on the signature pages and defense forms. The signed signature pages will be accepted as attachments, and the Graduate College will print to bond paper. There is some flexibility in deadlines for submission in time for Spring 2020 graduation. Please contact Mary Martin for additional details.</p>\n<p>Finances</p>\n<p>Graduate stipends</p>\n<p>The President and Provost have asked that faculty continue to support graduate students in their current roles, even if they are unable to continue their work in person, with compensation at current levels. Due to the range of different work they do, research assistants (RAs), teaching assistants (TAs) and graduate assistants (GAs) may each be affected differently. Individuals should ask their supervisor about how to continue carrying out their work responsibilities. In many cases, their work assignments will change so that they can be productive without coming to campus. For example, TAs may be asked to support online courses, and most graduate student researchers will have to do work that does not require access to a laboratory.</p>\n<p>Financial Hardship</p>\n<p>Although the University is committed to continuity of pay for graduate students on contract, we recognize that other factors related to COVID-19 may have an impact on finances. Emergency loans (up to $1,000) are available from the Graduate College for students on contract. Please contact Mary Martin to apply. The Student Financial Services Office also has an emergency loan program (up to $500). The contact for these loans is Joseph Bradley.</p>\n<p>The University of Delaware’s Student Crisis Fund also supports eligible students who face a serious financial hardship due to an unanticipated crisis.

We know this is not a typical spring semester at the University of Delaware, and we already miss seeing you here on our campus and in our classrooms. Many of you may feel anxious about your academic progress, or disappointed by the prospect of distance learning as an alternative to the interactive campus experience we have all come to know and love at UD. We hear you, and we understand. That is why we formed a dedicated University committee to evaluate opportunities to maximize your success and recommend a plan forward for academic progress.</p>\n<p>As a result, we have decided to provide some greater flexibility to facilitate adaptiveness and productivity for the Spring 2020 semester only, and we are committed to help you achieve your goals and finish strong. This means we are implementing some fundamental changes in the delivery of our academic programs that include modification of our grading policy as well as an extension of the period during which students may withdraw from courses without academic penalty. You will find a more detailed explanation of the emergency policies we are putting into place for this semester, effective immediately, at this link.</p>\n<p>We can assure you that the entire University administration is focused on doing everything possible to sustain academic continuity with a focus on the long view, advancing students toward the finish line with fairness and flexibility. To this end, the Provost’s Office will work closely with the colleges, the Registrar’s Office and Student Financial Services to make this progress possible.</p>\n<p>Student success is not something we just support at UD; it is what defines our mission. During this time of transition, we remain committed to carry that mission forward, and we believe in you and all that you will accomplish in the coming months. Above all, please remember to take care of yourselves, with health and safety as the number one priority.</p>\n<p>We appreciate your patience and understanding as we all work together through the current circumstances, and we wish you the best of luck for a great semester ahead!</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Dennis Assanis</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Robin Morgan</p>\n<p>Provost</p>","id":"33d31489-91b3-5163-ab08-6530dfe86aaf","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-udel/2020-04-08-23_34_48/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Emergency academic policies now in place"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.udel.edu/content/dam/udelImages/udaily/2020/march/fb-aerial-The-Green-2-800x420.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Editor’s note: The following message was sent to University of Delaware students by José-Luis Riera, vice president for Student Life, and Adam Cantley, dean of students, on March 24, 2020.</p>\n<p>Dear students,</p>\n<p>As UD prepares to resume its spring semester, we find our community in the midst of a public health threat unlike anything we have ever experienced before. We are reaching out to share important information for you to keep in mind to protect your health and wellbeing during this time.</p>\n<p>The State of Delaware has issued a Stay-At-Home Order until May 15, or until the coronavirus (COVID-19) public health threat is eliminated. All non-essential businesses are now closed as of 8 a.m. on March 24, and Delaware residents are only permitted to leave their homes for essential activities such as purchasing groceries or visiting a doctor or pharmacy; only select restaurants continue to operate, limiting service to take-out only. This latest update from Gov. Carney requires Delawareans to stay at home whenever possible and adhere to social distancing guidelines with very limited interactions, including refraining from organizing or attending social gatherings of any size . This applies to all students in our local community, no matter where you are living, on campus or off campus.</p>\n<p>In addition, the City of Newark and University of Delaware police departments will actively continue patrol initiatives in support of this order with keen attention to the City of Newark’s unruly gathering ordinance, the city council’s recent emergency ordinance related to social gatherings during the pandemic situation and, of course, enforcement of UD’s student code of conduct where applicable. During this time, we want to share the following guidance:</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Students: If you choose to continue living off-campus during this time, please keep in mind requirements associated with the State Order noted above will be strictly enforced. If you have returned to your permanent home for spring break, you should consider staying there for the remainder of the semester. If you must return to your off-campus housing, please know campus support resources will continue to be available and we encourage you to reach out for any assistance you may need.</p>\n<p>If you choose to continue living off-campus during this time, please keep in mind requirements associated with the State Order noted above will be strictly enforced.

For Spring 2020 only, courses taken S-U will be accepted for all degree requirements with S grades if a student opts for this route.  However, students will need to think about longer-term impacts of their decision to shift to S-U grading.  For example, some graduate schools and professional schools do not accept S grades in courses, and, as of yet, associations representing these schools have not released any information concerning courses taken in Spring 2020.  Every student contemplating shifting to S-U grading or dropping their course should consult guidance prepared by their departments and /or college, reach out to aspirational professional schools to ask whether they will accept an S grade, and/or reach out to their academic advisor for guidance in making the right choice for them.</p>\n<p>Also, the disruption in living at a time when courses transitioned has not afforded students and faculty time to equilibrate to the new academic environment.

What followed has been quite remarkable: our campus community has united like never before to address many obstacles and adapt our campus operations. Over the course of the last week, I have witnessed countless examples of altruism, compassion, resilience, and determination on the part of our faculty, staff, and students. This terrible crisis is revealing the best of who we are and what our institution values.</p>\n<p>Words cannot express how grateful I am for all that you are doing to help the University navigate this unprecedented and often stressful situation. As we work diligently to continue delivering our essential mission, however, we must keep one priority firmly entrenched at the forefront of our efforts: maintaining the health, safety, and wellbeing of our community. There can be no greater priority. Our thoughts and prayers are with those at our University who are suffering from this dreadful illness; to the brave and dedicated health care providers who are fighting it; and to the leaders of our state, nation, and world as they strive to make decisions to slow the spread of this contagion. I am particularly grateful for the excellent work of many UGA faculty members who are helping inform decision-makers and find a cure.</p>\n<p>Now I want to speak directly to our seniors, graduate, and professional students who are approaching graduation in May. I share your disappointment over the directive to cancel Commencement. I understand how frustrated you are at this time. I am frustrated, too. You should know that I have assembled a group to explore a range of options for honoring and celebrating your graduation at the appropriate time. Once we see significant progress in stopping this pandemic, the University will be in a much better position to determine what might be possible. Until then, I appreciate your patience as we work through this dilemma.</p>\n<p>In closing, we will face many expected and unexpected challenges as we transition to online instruction in the days and weeks ahead. Let us remain patient, supportive, and cooperative as we navigate the coming days and weeks. The reality is that our University has never before faced a set of circumstances this complex and this challenging, but as long as we continue to work together—as long as we remain focused on finding solutions—we will succeed.

Morehead, President</p>\n<p>Jack Hu, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs</p>\n<p>Ryan Nesbit, Vice President for Finance and Administration</p>\n<p>Victor Wilson, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>Thank you once again for your understanding as the University of Georgia diligently works to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the University community. We are striving to be attentive in responding to all of your concerns and questions as swiftly as possible, and we appreciate your continued patience and grace as we respond to this unprecedented event and prepare to continue the excellent learning experience you expect.</p>\n<p>In response to guidance provided by the University System of Georgia (USG) with respect to refunding of housing, dining, and other fees for Spring 2020, the University of Georgia has requested and received approval from the USG to implement a Student Refund Plan for students who have paid or been assessed these fees for the Spring 2020 semester, with the following considerations:</p>\n<p>March 16 is considered the last service date for the services referenced below.</p>\n<p>Since the Spring Semester was approximately halfway through as of March 16 (54%, to be exact), 46% of the Athletic, Green, Recreation, and Transportation Fees will be refunded.</p>\n<p>Additionally:</p>\n<p>UGA will refund 46% of the portion of the Student Center Facility Fee not committed to debt service obligations associated with the Tate Center Renovation and Expansion project (30% of this fee is not committed to the debt service).</p>\n<p>The University will refund 46% of the portion of the Student Activity Fee that supports programming and events (25% of this fee supports student programming and events).</p>\n<p>In recognition of reduced in-person access to the University Health Center, UGA will refund 10% of the Health Fee. The University Health Center will remain fully staffed and operational throughout the Spring semester, continuing to serve all UGA students through remote and telemedicine platforms for those away from campus as well as in-person access for students who remain on campus and in the local community. Additionally, the University Health Center is a major resource in the University and local community’s ever-evolving response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the USG guidance, UGA will not provide refunds for tuition, the Special Institutional Fee, the Technology Fee, or the ConnectUGA Fee, as these remain critical in supporting continuity of instruction and associated support. Separately, students who choose to withdraw entirely will be refunded in accordance with UGA’s normal refund schedule, which can be found at <a href=\"https://busfin.uga.edu/bursar/refunds_spring_undergrad_2020.pdf\">https://busfin.uga.edu/bursar/refunds_spring_undergrad_2020.pdf</a>.</p>\n<p>For University Housing residents, students on the Dining Services meal plan, and students with parking permits, the University has requested and received approval to implement refunds, with the following considerations:</p>\n<p>March 16 is considered the last service date for the services referenced below.</p>\n<p>For University Housing residents, UGA will refund the respective Spring semester rate per individual resident based on their number of unutilized bed nights and the specific rate for the residence hall in which they lived.</p>\n<p>For students on the Residential Dining Services meal plan, 46% of the respective Spring semester rate will be refunded. Commuter (Block Plans) will be refunded based on the unused balance of meals. Any remaining Paw Point balances for Spring 2020 will also be refunded.</p>\n<p>Students with parking permits will receive refunds based on days remaining on the student’s permit from March 16 forward.</p>\n<p>More details about this Student Refund Plan, including dollar amounts and refund schedules, may be found at <a href=\"https://busfin.uga.edu/bursar/refund/\">https://busfin.uga.edu/bursar/refund/</a>, which will continue to be updated as information becomes available. We did not include specific dollar amounts in this email because each student’s refund amount and schedule are unique, and we want to keep this initial communication succinct and clear.</p>\n<p>We expect to begin issuing refunds the week of March 30, and the process will most likely continue through April 10. This rolling timeline will allow us to calculate refund amounts, ensure all refunds are compliant with financial aid rules based on Department of Education guidance, and give students time to verify their refund profile in Athena. The most efficient way to receive your refund is via direct deposit.</p>\n<p>If you have not updated your Athena student account refund profile, please do so by March 30, 2020. Visit <a href=\"http://busfin.uga.edu/bursar/athena_refund_profile_setup.pdf\">http://busfin.uga.edu/bursar/athena_refund_profile_setup.pdf</a> for instructions to set up or verify your banking information. If your refund profile is not established, the University will mail your refund to you. Please ensure this mailing address in your Athena account is updated by March 30, 2020, if a mailed check is preferred.</p>\n<p>Refunds associated with Study Abroad/Study Away programs that have been suspended or cancelled are in process and will be issued on an ongoing basis. You will receive a separate communication once refunds for these programs are finalized.</p>\n<p>We understand you may have questions about this process, and we invite you to submit those to stuacct@uga.edu; we will respond as swiftly as possible. Again, thank you for your patience as we work to provide care and attention to each individual, which necessarily takes some time.</p>\n<p>Students may expect further communication about online instruction as well as available student services, support and care, and we encourage you to share these communications with your parents and guardians as you receive them. Direct communication with students is our primary and most effective method for getting this information to both students and parents.</p>\n<p>Students, please pay close attention to your email inboxes and refer to UGA coronavirus website for the most up-to-date information about campus services, classes and ongoing developments.</p>\n<p>Once again, thank you for your understanding during this unprecedented and challenging time. We are strengthened by witnessing the undaunted determination of students and their families to continue learning, to progress in their education, and to make this the best educational experience possible. Our faculty and staff are earnestly working alongside you in this effort.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>","id":"d65e24a9-ef57-5aad-8280-e4bfdd4930d9","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-uga/2020-04-08-23_27_46/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Student Refund Plan, March 20, 2020"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.uga.edu/_resources/icons/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png\"></p>\n<p>Online Learning for the Remainder of the Spring Semester</p>\n<p>Date:</p>\n<p>March 16, 2020</p>\n<p>To:</p>\n<p>Faculty, Staff and Students</p>\n<p>From:</p>\n<p>Jere W.

We will work to develop a coordinated plan for this process that incorporates social distancing, and we will communicate this plan shortly.</p>\n<p>For Immediate Release from University System of Georgia</p>\n<p>The University System of Georgia (USG) has decided that all 26 institutions will move to online instruction for all courses for the remainder of the semester with extremely limited exceptions. This action comes following last week’s decision to suspend instruction for two weeks to ensure business and instructional continuity, and to allow further state assessment of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Students are not allowed to return to campus until they receive permission from their institution, which will be forthcoming soon.</p>\n<p>Additionally, residence halls will be closed, with minimal exceptions for students unable to return home, or who cannot find housing elsewhere. Students will receive specific instructions from campus leaders regarding when they will be allowed to return to campus to retrieve their belongings from residence halls. Students must follow those instructions. For those students who are unable to depart campus, we will make every effort to accommodate these students.</p>\n<p>USG will be providing guidance to campuses on refunds for housing, dining, and other services. Students should wait for their campus to contact them.</p>\n<p>Institutions will remain open, with minimal staff physically on-site, to ensure continuity of certain services.</p>\n<p>In the end, we want to ensure that our faculty, staff and students are safe; that we do our part to help stem the spread of the coronavirus in Georgia; and that we fulfill our mission to graduate our students even in the face of these challenging times.</p>\n<p>Teresa MacCartney</p>\n<p>Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia</p>","id":"2c0d2cdb-870c-5ef7-947f-54740ee38668","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-uga/2020-04-08-23_27_49/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Online Learning for the Remainder of the Spring Semester"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.uga.edu/_resources/icons/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png\"></p>\n<p>Reminder: Student Conduct Policy</p>\n<p>Date:</p>\n<p>April 8, 2020</p>\n<p>To:</p>\n<p>University of Georgia Students</p>\n<p>From:</p>\n<p>Victor Wilson, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>Rahul Shrivastav, Vice President for Instruction</p>\n<p>E.

The situation has and likely will continue to change quickly, and we want to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep the Hawkeye community safe and healthy.</p>\n<p>Delaying and extending virtual instruction</p>\n<p>In order to give everyone additional time to transition to online teaching, the university is delaying the start of virtual instruction by one week. Courses will now resume Monday, March 30, and will be conducted virtually through the rest of the spring semester.</p>\n<p>Students in courses with a clinical component or fieldwork will receive further information from the academic leaders in their programs about how these will be addressed. Students can find more information about online learning from their instructors, through the Keep Learning at Iowa website, and the coronavirus.uiowa.edu website.</p>\n<p>Faculty can continue to find resources on the Keep Teaching at Iowa website. University classrooms will be open and available for instructors to record their lectures during the virtual instruction period. To streamline classroom scheduling and other service areas, departmental administrators should provide the Office of the Registrar with a document that includes all course numbers and instructors who want to use their regular classroom days and times.</p>\n<p>Closing most residence halls</p>\n<p>To reduce the number of students spending time in close quarters, the UI will close most of its market places, residence halls, and on-campus housing starting Thursday, March 19.</p>\n<p>Procedures for an orderly move-out and transition policies, including retrieving essential items, will be provided to housing residents via email by Thursday, March 19, and published on the University Housing &#x26; Dining website.</p>\n<p>We ask that students do not return to the residence halls until their designated time to move out. If a student is currently on campus for spring break, they should begin preparations to move out. We realize that not all students have alternative housing and dining options, and we will continue to accommodate students who cannot immediately return to their permanent residence. Requests to remain in the residence halls will be submitted online.</p>\n<p>Information about refunds to those with housing and dining contracts will be coming soon.</p>\n<p>Canceling spring commencement ceremonies</p>\n<p>We are extremely disappointed to announce that we must cancel spring commencement ceremonies.

We are in the process of planning an alternative celebration for graduating Hawkeyes and will share additional details soon.</p>\n<p>All other UI events will likewise be canceled, postponed, or conducted virtually for the remainder of the spring semester.</p>\n<p>Working remotely</p>\n<p>We have asked all employees outside of UI Health Care to work remotely unless the critical function they provide must be completed on campus. Working from home will accommodate social distancing and reduce the threat of spread for everyone, including colleagues who are remaining on campus to perform essential services. Colleges and vice-presidential units are working with their respective senior human resources leaders to identify staff and student employees who are performing non-critical work and who could potentially be reassigned.</p>\n<p>Employees who have communicated with their supervisor about volunteering for reassignment can now do so by following this link to UI Self Service.</p>\n<p>We know many of you have questions and concerns about compensation during this period of disruption. We are reviewing state guidelines to ensure compliance, and we will make every effort to support our employees, including our student employees. We will share additional information soon.</p>\n<p>Because so many employees will be working remotely, the UI Department of Public Safety has recommended and the Critical Incident Management Team has approved limiting building access, when possible, to authorized personnel only.

For the latest parking updates, please see the service alerts page on the UI Parking and Transportation website.</p>\n<p>Staying informed</p>\n<p>Because the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve rapidly, it is important that all students, faculty, and staff check their UI email daily.

These programs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>Orientation/Registration Programs for New, Domestic First-Year, and Transfer Students to Go Online</p>\n<p>Due to COVID-19 safety precautions, the University of Iowa has made the difficult decision to transition to online orientation and registration programs and services through the end of July 2020. This information was communicated to incoming students and their families earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Additional opportunities for new students and their families to connect virtually with other students and with faculty and staff will be offered throughout the summer. A full schedule of events will be available in May on the orientation website. The UI looks forward to welcoming its incoming class of Hawkeyes during the OnIowa! program which will take place Aug. 18–23, 2020.</p>\n<p>Cambus Service Update</p>\n<p>SERVICE ADJUSTMENTS BEGINNING APRIL 6</p>\n<p>Cambus will continue to provide interim service but with some adjustments after analysis of campus needs and ridership data, including switching to a weeknight demand-response service from 9 p.m. midnight. Visit the Cambus alerts webpage for complete details.</p>\n<p>Helpful Reminders</p>\n<p>WORKING REMOTELY</p>\n<p>Unless you perform a critical function that must be completed on campus, UI employees outside of UI Health Care have been directed to work remotely in accordance with the state public disaster emergency, which the governor has extended until April 30, 2020. Each of you contributes to the successful operation of the university, but working from home supports social distancing and reduces the threat of COVID-19 for everyone, including colleagues who must perform essential services on campus.</p>\n<p>SELF-REPORTING COVID-19</p>\n<p>If you are still reporting to work on campus and are experiencing symptoms consistent with or are diagnosed with COVID-19, please stay home and report your illness to your supervisor and/or local HR leader. Your supervisor or senior HR leader will follow the COVID-19 self-reporting protocol to request a cleaning and ensure appropriate notification to fellow employees.</p>\n<p>ALL NON-ESSENTIAL BUSINESS TRAVEL CANCELED</p>\n<p>Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds canceled all non-essential business travel for state agencies, which includes Iowa’s public universities. Accordingly, all university-related non-essential domestic travel is prohibited until further notice, effective immediately. This includes travel to conferences, for training or meetings, or athletic travel. Essential travel is defined as travel that is essential to the operation of the university, that no alternative method of convening is possible, and that the health and safety of state of Iowa employees will be appropriately managed.</p>\n<p>Essential travel must:</p>\n<p>Support the health care clinical enterprise</p>\n<p>Preserve the safety of a research subject</p>\n<p>Preserve the results of a research activity</p>\n<p>Earn academic credit that is necessary to meet a graduation requirement</p>\n<p>Maintain critical business continuity for the university</p>\n<p>Domestic and international trips currently routing for approval or already approved in ProTrav will be marked “Canceled per Iowa Governor directive,” and both the traveler and approver will be notified of this change. If a trip was previously approved and is deemed essential per the guidelines above, you will need to resubmit your request through ProTrav. You can find more information about the approval process and how to submit a request on the travel page.</p>","id":"f2006705-56d5-571b-903c-217b6be9523b","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-uiowa/2020-04-10-14_02_25/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Campus update: Summer programming, CAMBUS, and other helpful reminders"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.umass.edu/coronavirus/sites/default/files/socialmedia/facebook.png\"></p>\n<p>Governor Charlie Baker has extended until May 4 his emergency order requiring all businesses and organizations that do not provide “COVID-19 Essential Services” to close their physical workplaces and facilities to workers, customers and the public.

Will I receive any account adjustments?</strong></h3>\n<p>The university will reimburse students the cost of Spring 2020 flight changes up to $500, if the student’s program provider is unable to do so. Programs have been modified by program providers, but curriculum has continued and credits will be awarded upon completion. Students with individual questions should contact their advisor.</p>\n<p>No decisions have been made at this time related to Summer 2020 study abroad programs.  Please look for updates on our Coronavirus website.</p>\n<h3><strong>Can I receive a refund for a portion of my parking permit fee if I am no longer parking on campus?</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes.

These positions may be subject to schedule changes and/or remote work.</p>\n<p>We recognize that the unexpected loss of income from student employment may add to the stress of an already difficult situation. With that in mind, the university has extended payroll for two weeks for student employees who have lost their work hours due to the disruption and has established a process to apply for additional support for student employees who face financial hardship as a result (see below).</p>\n<h3><strong>Is financial support available for students who are facing hardships as a result of the coronavirus?</strong></h3>\n<p>Students with personal circumstances or extreme hardships should contact the Office of the Dean of Students for support (See <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/student-support-request-referral\">www.</a><a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/student-support-request-referral\">umass.edu/dean_students/student-support-request-referral</a>). We are monitoring the bills being passed by Congress and will advise students of any additional help available.</p>\n<h2>Housing</h2>\n<h3><strong>Can I still live on campus?</strong></h3>\n<p>No. The deadline for students to let the university know that they needed to remain on campus was March 18. </p>\n<h3><strong>Can UMass help facilitate changes to my off campus lease?</strong></h3>\n<p>Lease agreements for off campus housing are legal contracts between the student and the landlord. The university has no authority to intervene in the lease or to force landlords to change their policies. Fee paying undergraduate and graduate students with concerns regarding their leases should contact Student Legal Services. See <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/slso/\">https://www.umass.edu/slso/</a> for contact information and relevant informational seminars/events. </p>\n<h2>Academics</h2>\n<h3>**Will there still be attendance requirements for my course?  **</h3>\n<p>Faculty are responsible for the content of their courses. The Provost has disseminated information about disrupted and resilient teaching to all instructors (see <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/provost/disruption-resilient-instruction\">www.umass.edu/provost/disruption-resilient-instruction</a>). That information included instructions for recording lectures and encouraged faculty to think about appropriate changes to their syllabus to enable a smoother transition to online. The Center for Teaching and Learning has also launched a Keep Teaching website and is offering phone and Zoom consultations to instructors to advise on how best to transition to remote learning.  If you have specific issues with your courses, please contact your professor or advisor.</p>\n<h3><strong>Will the class withdrawal date be extended?</strong></h3>\n<p>The deadline to withdraw from classes has been extended to April 29, 2020.</p>\n<h3><strong>Can I still take an incomplete for my courses this semester?</strong></h3>\n<p>Assignment of grades is the responsibility of the faculty member teaching each course. This is no less true during unprecedented circumstances like those we face today. The Provost’s Office and Deans will be encouraging faculty to take these circumstances into account and exercise as much flexibility as reasonably possible when determining grades for this semester.  For your specific circumstances, please contact your professor.</p>\n<h3><strong>Can I take my courses pass/fail this semester?</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes. Please see this announcement: <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/coronavirus/news/spring-term-2020-guidelines-regarding-passfail-and-satunsat-options\">www.umass.edu/coronavirus/spring-term-2020-guidelines-regarding-passfail-and-satunsat-options</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>How will my study abroad credit be handled?</strong></h3>\n<p>The International Programs Office (IPO) is working with the Provost’s Office and academic departments to ensure that students, especially graduating seniors, are able to receive the credit they were signed up for.  In the vast majority of cases, partner universities and study-abroad programs are making arrangements for remote completion of study abroad courses, so there should be minimal academic disruption.  Where this is not possible, IPO will work with academic departments to provide some form of comparable enrollment through UMass options (UWW courses, independent study, etc.) at no extra cost to the student.  Please contact <a href=\"mailto:abroad@ipo.umass.edu\">abroad@ipo.umass.edu</a>. </p>\n<h3><strong>Will I still graduate if my courses/credits were disrupted?</strong></h3>\n<p>The university intends to do whatever is reasonably possible to ensure that the graduation/certification of students scheduled to graduate this spring is not delayed due to the current COVID-19 situation. The Provost’s Office and Deans are working closely to determine the best approaches to these circumstances. Students in these courses can expect an update on the University’s coronavirus website as soon as these determinations have been made. You can also contact your professor with specific questions.</p>\n<h3><strong>Can I still use the library for my classes and research?</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes. Although the libraries, including the W. E. B. Du Bois Library, will be closed until further notice, Library staff will be updating the library website and will ramp up support for online services including scanning course reserve materials, digital interlibrary loan and online research support. All library resources still available are listed on the library website: <a href=\"https://www.library.umass.edu/about-the-libraries/covid-19-updates/\">www.library.umass.edu/about-the-libraries/covid-19-updates/</a></p>\n<h2>Student Support Services</h2>\n<h3><strong>Can I still use the Center for Counseling and Psychological Health this semester?</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes. There are no plans to close CCPH. Please visit the CCPH website for more information: <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/counseling/\">www.umass.edu/counseling/</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Can I still use University Health Services this semester?</strong></h3>\n<p>UHS remains open this semester, but patients are asked to call before coming to the building for care. Adult routine physicals are cancelled, but pediatric well visits remain available. The Pharmacy remains open. Students can also call in to the Telehealth appointment line to schedule time with a provider: 413-577-5101.</p>\n<h3><strong>Can I still access the Assistive Technology Center while off campus?</strong></h3>\n<p>The UMass Assistive Technology Center (ATC) will operate remotely Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and provide access to a wide variety of software to help students, staff and faculty access courses digitally. If you are a person with a disability seeking assistance in accessing your electronic courses through Moodle or Blackboard, ATC can provide access to: Screen readers; Magnification software; Dictation software; Text-to-speech programs; Task management applications; Note-taking tools for your Windows PC, Mac, iOS, or Android device; Chrome extensions to maximize your ability to access online classes; and Assistive Technology Work Stations.

However, we are not in a position to provide financial assistance to those students who wish to return to campus for any future events.</p>\n<h2>Other</h2>\n<h3>How is the university addressing employee health and safety?</h3>\n<p>Only those employees deemed critical remain on campus. Employees designated as working onsite who are over the age of 60, pregnant, or who suffer from a chronic health condition such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease are eligible for alternative work assignments during the COVID-19 outbreak. Such employees should contact Central HR at 413-687-2283 or <a href=\"mailto:Covid19HR@umass.edu\">Covid19HR@umass.edu</a>, and the HR representative will work with the employee to approve the request and inform the supervisor. The employee is responsible for finalizing the details of work assignment with the department.</p>\n<h3><strong>Is UMass advocating for any federal or state bills to support higher education during this pandemic?</strong></h3>\n<p>Our government relations staff are reviewing all state and federal bills that are being produced in light of the coronavirus. The campuses in the UMass system are jointly advocating for those bills that directly impact higher education.</p>\n<h3><strong>How can I stay up to date on decisions and changes on campus?</strong></h3>\n<p>The UMass COVID-19 website (<a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/coronavirus/\">www.umass.edu/coronavirus/</a>) is the best resource for information.

Our vulnerability connects us. This global emergency will demand much from us all, but our community is up to the challenge. Together we have the capacity to make it through, with determination and compassion.</p>\n<p><strong>Online education</strong><br>\nEarlier today, Governor Hogan advised all University System of Maryland (USM) institutions to extend online education for the remainder of the semester. The USM Board of Regents this evening approved this guidance. Therefore, all UMD online instruction, which had already been scheduled to start on March 30, 2020, will continue through the end of this academic year.</p>\n<p>Our faculty has been preparing continuously and diligently for virtual education. Under the coordinated leadership of Provost Mary Ann Rankin and VP for IT Jeff Hollingsworth, the University has implemented secure online testing and assessment, such as new identity verification and proctoring software. For laboratory instruction, there are online simulations and video demonstrations, with resources for faculty available at <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/keepteaching.umd.edu\">keepteaching.umd.edu</a>. For performance and studio instruction, we have acquired the capacity for synchronous and asynchronous video production and video streaming. Teachers and department administrators will be developing individualized solutions for the courses during the coming week, before classes resume on March 30.</p>\n<p>We are mindful of the <a href=\"https://svp.umd.edu/keepteaching/ada-accommodations-student\">resources</a> needed for individuals with disabilities, so that they and their instructors have accessibility accommodations in online learning and teleworking.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Division of IT has deployed new technology to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to support this massive shift to the online environment for learning and working.</p>\n<p><strong>Students in residence halls</strong><br>\nWith the extension of online education through the end of the academic year, residence halls will officially close for the semester on April 5, 2020. All residents will have to move out by this date. The Division of Student Affairs under VP Patty Perillo will soon release a detailed message to residents for an orderly move out of residence halls, in a process that ensures social distancing and the health and safety of our students.</p>\n<p>VP Perillo and her staff will continue to work closely with students who have no alternatives and need housing. We will do everything in our power to take care of our students during this fraught time.</p>\n<p><strong>Teleworking</strong><br>\nFor all University personnel who can perform their job responsibilities remotely, telework remains in effect until at least April 10, 2020. How we do our work will change depending on the success of our efforts to slow the spread of this pandemic. We will follow the guidance of federal, state, and local agencies, and from the USM, regarding any changes in how we do our work. University Human Resources will communicate any important updates to all employees.</p>\n<p><strong>Commencement and forthcoming information</strong><br>\nThe measures that the University is taking, while necessary, create hardship and uncertainty for many in our community. These measures have to comport with directives and guidance issued by state agencies and the University System of Maryland. In the coming days, we will work on a fair adjustment of costs related to room and board.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there will not be an in-person spring 2020 commencement. Our graduating students have worked so hard and I know that they, and their families, would want to celebrate this milestone. I invite you to share with me your thoughts on alternative and innovative ways to recognize this occasion, vibrantly and safely. You may email me at <a href=\"mailto:president@umd.edu\">president@umd.edu</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Updates and resources</strong><br>\nPlease continue to check umd.edu/virusinfo and all University communications for updates about COVID-19. Please email <a href=\"mailto:healthconcerns@umd.edu\">healthconcerns@umd.edu</a> for any non-medical coronavirus-related questions.</p>\n<p>For mental health support for students, please call the Counseling Center at 301.314.7651. Counselors are available to provide remote services Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, and After Hours Crisis Support is available outside those hours and on weekends. Faculty and staff can contact the Faculty Staff Assistance Program.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you</strong><br>\nI want to thank all the hard-working faculty, staff, administrators, and students, and all the health-care providers in our University Health Center, for your dedication and service in this fraught time. And, as always, I thank our Police Department for their continued commitment to serve. So long as each of us continues to do our civic duty to help slow the transmission of the coronavirus, our normal life will be restored sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>I conclude by noting that this virus does not know how to discriminate between people on the basis of identity. This reminds us that we are all members of the same human family, and we all need to come together in mutual support.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/umd.edu/files/Coronavirus/Signature.png\" alt=\"Dr. Loh&#x27;&#x27;s signature\"></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace D.

However, there are 19 confirmed cases in the D.C.-Maryland-Northern Virginia region, including three in Prince George?s County. While the epidemiology of this virus is not yet fully known, public health experts have announced that community spread is occuring in parts of the United States. Therefore, we must implement policies now to mitigate the risk of transmission and minimize the chances of seeing cases on our campus.</p>\n<p><strong>Move to an online environment</strong><br>\nStarting March 30, 2020 and continuing at least to April 10, 2020:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All classroom instruction will be conducted virtually; and</li>\n<li>For functions that can be performed remotely, supervisors are encouraged to offer employees the option to telework.

We will all have to operate in a different learning and working environment. We will manage the transition to online platforms with as minimal interruption as possible. I ask for your cooperation so that the health and safety of our community remains the top priority in this rapidly changing context.</p>\n<p><strong>March 16-22, 2020</strong><br>\nStudents should plan to depart for spring break and not return to campus until at least April 10, 2020. When preparing to leave for this break, please take all essential belongings, medications, and materials from the residence hall and/or work space.</p>\n<p>We urge that you exercise caution and judgment if you are planning any domestic or international travel. Please take into account the possibilities of travel delays and required self-isolation upon return.</p>\n<p>The University will be open for staff Wednesday, March 18 to Friday, March 20, 2020, as planned.</p>\n<p><strong>March 23-29, 2020</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The University will have reduced operations the week of March 23, 2020.</li>\n<li>Classes are cancelled this week and students should not return to campus following spring break.

In addition, faculty will also have this week to participate in further training sessions. The training will continue through March 27, 2020.</li>\n<li>Except for classes, the University will remain open. Staff are expected to report for work that can be performed either by telecommuting or in person, as agreed upon with their supervisor.</li>\n<li>Graduate students who work or conduct research on campus should consult with their supervisors on how they would conduct their work this week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>March 30, 2020 through at least April 10, 2020</strong><br>\nAs already indicated, all classroom instruction will be conducted online. Students will receive instructions on how to access their classes online.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong><br>\nOur goal is that students, faculty, and staff have the necessary equipment and skills to learn and work from home.</p>\n<p>To this end, we have created a new resource for faculty, <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/keepteaching.umd.edu\">keepteaching.umd.edu</a>, which includes guidance, strategies, and resources to change from in-person instruction to virtual instruction. More information on training and resources will be forthcoming from Provost and Senior Vice President Mary Ann Rankin and the Division of Information Technology (under Vice President Jeff Hollingsworth).</p>\n<p>All employees and supervisors should review the resources available at <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/keepworking.umd.edu\">keepworking.umd.edu</a> and determine what equipment, technology, and resources are needed to allow staff to be successful in working remotely and conducting meetings online.</p>\n<p>The Division of Information Technology will soon send out a <a href=\"https://umdsurvey.umd.edu/jfe/form/SV_3eEQgPQEKFvfJyt\">technology survey</a> to students to understand any unmet needs students may have.</p>\n<p>Additional information for supervisors about employee-leave management, essential employees, and related workplace issues will be available from the University Human Resources Office (under Assistant Vice President Jewel Washington) in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Additional information about residence halls, dining services, disability services, the Health Center, libraries, recreational services, shuttle services, and other student resources on campus will be provided soon by the Vice President for Student Affairs Patty Perillo.</p>\n<p>Additional information about the University's research activities will be shared as soon as possible by the Vice President for Research Laurie Locascio.</p>\n<p><strong>Events</strong><br>\nThe University strongly discourages hosting or attending any non-essential large gatherings.

Gretchen Whitmer issued an order that the vast majority of Michiganders “Stay Home and Stay Safe,” calling for the suspension of most in-person work beginning at midnight through April 13, 2020, for our state in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>The order broadly directs residents to remain at home or in their place of residence to the maximum extent feasible, and references several exceptions that are relevant to our university. These include workers in health care, public health, public safety, and critical infrastructure. Specifically, the order references federal guidelines that specify as critical: “educators supporting public and private K-12 schools, colleges, and universities for purposes of facilitating distance learning or performing other essential functions, if operating under rules for social distancing.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to the considerable efforts of many across the University of Michigan, we’re already doing much of what the governor’s order specifies. We have implemented strong measures that maintain critical aspects of our education, research and patient care while protecting health and safety and diminishing spread of the virus.</p>\n<p>The actions we have taken will remain in place, as they align closely with the governor’s order:</p>\n<p>Winter term classes will continue remotely and in alternative formats. Instructors and those supporting technology needed for remote delivery of courses should work remotely but can continue to utilize university and classroom resources to deliver remote instruction as needed.</p>\n<p>We will continue to support students living on and near campus by providing essential on-site support.</p>\n<p>Employees who can work from home will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>The order will not significantly alter the university’s research operations, as we moved last Friday to ramp down all noncritical laboratory research activities.</p>\n<p>We’ve significantly reduced density on our campuses, work is happening differently, and we continue to fulfill our mission. This has happened quickly and professionally – and I cannot overstate my appreciation for your commitment.</p>\n<p>For the duration of the governor’s executive order, I now ask everyone to explicitly implement the following:</p>\n<p>All campus employees should work remotely unless your unit needs you on campus to maintain the work we’ve identified as critical to our mission, including in the delivery of courses remotely. I would encourage managers to identify work that could be reassigned and for employees to work with unit managers in identifying creative solutions and ideas. This does not apply to Michigan Medicine, which is developing its own guidelines based on the executive order and will communicate those soon.</p>\n<p>Supervisors should continually evaluate their units’ operations, including finding appropriate ways to redeploy employees for supporting critical operations and/or tasks that can be performed remotely within their units.</p>\n<p>There will be additional anxiety, questions and considerations as we seek to understand how the Stay Home, Stay Safe order affects us. I ask supervisors to communicate as quickly and thoroughly as possible, understanding that we are in a period that is virtually unprecedented in how it affects us as people.</p>\n<p>Continue to stay home if sick, observe social distancing guidelines, and per the order, “all public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring among persons not part of a single household are prohibited.”</p>\n<p>Many employees are asking how they can help. Michigan Medicine has asked all who are able to consider donating blood.</p>\n<p>We will continue to post updates, information and answers to frequently asked questions on our COVID-19 information website. The university has activated its emergency call center to assist those with COVID-19 questions specifically related to U-M responses. It is available Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at (877) 763-3040. [UPDATE: The university emergency call center is being suspended March 25 at 5 p.m. Information will continue to be posted on the COVID-19 information page linked above. The Michigan Medicine patient hotline below will remain in operation.]</p>\n<p>For medical related questions, please call your doctor. Michigan Medicine patients with questions about symptoms, home management or advice should call the Michigan Medicine COVID-19 hotline at 734-763-6336.</p>\n<p>Update on spring and summer terms</p>\n<p>Additionally, I am announcing that all spring and summer term courses at the University of Michigan’s three campuses will be conducted remotely in alternative formats. This decision aligns with our ongoing efforts to respond to the pandemic, by maintaining this critical part of our mission while encouraging social distancing.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with our provost’s offices, I ask schools and colleges to prioritize offering programs and coursework that allows current students to keep working toward their degrees and not fall behind.</p>\n<p>Schools and colleges will have the flexibility to cancel programs that they determine cannot be delivered with high quality in a remote format.</p>\n<p>More details on this will be available today in the University Record.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>This has been a challenging time for everyone in our community. We’ve been affected personally – and tragically – by the spread of the virus. We’ve been asked to think and work differently, under considerable time pressures and growing stress.</p>\n<p>We’ve also demonstrated our strength and resilience as students, faculty, staff and community members. While the COVID-19 pandemic has placed extraordinary demands on our university and its people, your response has exceeded the extraordinary.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your dedication, your creativity and your support of one another and our mission as a public university.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Mark S.

We must continue to practice important preventive measures and social distancing, if we are to slow the transmission of this pandemic.  </p>\n<p><strong>Spring Commencement 2020</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most regrettable impacts of COVID-19 is on commencement. There is no academic ceremony that I cherish more than congratulating graduates on their receipt of a UMD diploma, and bidding them Godspeed as they commence the next chapter of their lives.</p>\n<p>In my campus letter last week, I wrote that \"there will not be an in-person spring 2020 commencement.\" But that is not the end of the story.</p>\n<p>The Chancellor of the University System of Maryland had announced previously that \"USM institutions will not be holding traditional, in-person commencement ceremonies\" in spring 2020, complying with the March 12th order of the Governor that \"events of more than 250 people are prohibited at all locations\" and \"must be canceled or postponed\" until the \"state of emergency\" proclamation of March 4th is rescinded.</p>\n<p>Canceling the May 22nd ceremony was heartbreaking, and I want to assure the Class of 2020 that the University will do its utmost to honor and celebrate your academic success with an in-person ceremony, so that your family, friends, professors, and staff can share in this joyous occasion. We are also exploring producing a virtual celebration to commemorate May 22nd. Provost Mary Ann Rankin leads a planning group and is gathering input from graduating students. We expect to announce plans within a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry for all the disruption that students, faculty, and staff are undergoing in their daily lives this semester. Many things have been canceled or postponed because of COVID-19, but caring for each other is not one of them. I appreciate the sacrifices you have made and the solidarity you have shown during this public health crisis. Please continue to keep in your thoughts and prayers the members of our community who have been infected, or are at risk of being infected, by this virus.  </p>\n<p><strong>Maryland General Assembly 2020</strong></p>\n<p>Not since the Civil War has the General Assembly adjourned early. This year, legislators completed their work in record time for reasons of public health.</p>\n<p>The legislature and the Governor set aside a minimum of $160 million to respond to the outbreak in the coming fiscal year and made emergency funds available right now.</p>\n<p>The overall budget demonstrates ongoing support for public higher education. The operating budget will keep us on an even keel, enabling us to maintain the mandatory day-to-day expenses. To keep education affordable, it caps in-state tuition at 2%. It includes a 2% cost-of-living increase for all state employees, starting next January.</p>\n<p>The capital budget funds the continuing construction of the new Chemistry and Biochemistry building and the new School of Public Policy building. The latter is made possible by additional and substantial philanthropic funding. The capital budget also provides resources for repair or upgrade of some existing buildings and campus infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The General Assembly renewed the Maryland E-Nnovation Initiative. Designed to spur basic and applied research in various fields, it offers matching state grants to recruit and retain top faculty and researchers. To date, this program has enabled the University to secure 11 endowed chairs.</p>\n<p>Legislators also enacted bills to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase funding for the Maryland Small Business Development Center, which the University operates as part of its land-grant mission of advancing economic development. This Center trains small business owners and helps them to secure needed capital. This work could not be more critical than at this moment, when many small businesses are tottering amid the safety restrictions to slow the transmission of the coronavirus.</li>\n<li>Make it easier to secure a conviction for a hate crime, by not requiring the prosecution to prove that hate was the sole motive for the crime. It is named after 2nd Lt. Richard Collins III. The University's plans to honor and memorialize the legacy of Lt. Collins will be announced on a date that all the parties deem is most opportune.</li>\n<li>Settle a long-running lawsuit on behalf of the State's four historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), to compensate them for unequal practices in the past that have disadvantaged these institutions. The legislation would increase funding for the HBCUs over a ten year period.</li>\n<li>Implement the recommendations of the Kirwan Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, intended to make major improvements to the State's K-12 public schools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this time, we do not yet know what will happen to the funding of the HBCU and the Kirwan Commission legislation. We also do not know what the State's budget would look like next fall, because of the uncertainties on tax revenues and increased expenses resulting from the pandemic.</p>\n<p>I thank the Hogan Administration and the General Assembly for their response to the public health crisis and for their continuing support of higher education and of the flagship institution. I also want to recognize all who advocated for UMD in Annapolis: USM officials; our state government relations staff; many faculty, staff, students, and administrators; our Alumni Association; and our UMCP Foundation Board of Trustees.  </p>\n<p><strong>Federal Assistance for Students and Institutions 2020</strong></p>\n<p>COVID-19 is disrupting profoundly the lives of students, faculty, and staff; institutional operations; and institutional finances, across the entire higher education landscape.</p>\n<p>The Federal Government is working on a coronavirus stimulus plan to boost the economy in anticipation of an economic recession. Therefore, the American Council of Education, together with other higher education associations (and UMD is a member of these organizations), has requested $50 billion in federal assistance as part of the stimulus plan.</p>\n<p>It would provide (1) emergency aid to students, including direct grants; (2) support for institutions to cover the operating losses and increased expenses because of COVID-19; (3) support for federally-funded research labs on campuses, that must wind down now and restart operations later; and (4) funding for the transition to distance education. Access to federal funds would relieve pressure on state budgets that will be stretched during a financial crisis.

The grade cut-off for a “P” will be the same as the traditional grade minimum for students to receive course credit, which is a C-.</p>\n<p>Students who are interested will be able to request that their “P” for a course be converted to a letter grade through a process that will be described in greater detail in the weeks to come. Such requests must be made by July 1.</p>\n<p>Students who receive “No Record Covid,” or “NRC,” will receive no course credit, but their grade point average will not be affected. Language will be added to transcripts explaining the university’s policy this term.</p>\n<p>This new policy also applies to undergraduates enrolled in graduate courses, but would not apply to classes graded before March 10.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the university will institute a more flexible withdrawal policy, allowing students to withdraw from a course up until April 21 and not have the course appear on their transcript.</p>\n<p>We plan to share additional information regarding graduate and professional coursework grading policies next week.</p>\n<p>While other institutions across the nation have adopted similar policies on grading, it is undoubtedly an unprecedented step for the University of Michigan. But these are unprecedented times, and I appreciate your flexibility.</p>\n<p>You should expect to receive additional information and guidance from your school or college next week. In the meantime, remember that <a href=\"https://coronavirus.umich.edu/\">https://coronavirus.umich.edu/</a> is our hub for all news and updates regarding the ongoing COVID-19 situation.</p>\n<p>Please take good care of yourselves, and those around you, during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Susan M.

I recognize the difficulties the outbreak has created for everyone, and appreciate the engagement and support we have seen within our community in recent weeks.</p>\n<p>Today, I am announcing a set of changes to accomplish two important goals:</p>\n<p>Further protect health and safety by minimizing the potential spread of the disease within our community and in the broader society.</p>\n<p>Keep all university operations up and running.</p>\n<p>More details are included below, and these actions apply to all three of our campuses:</p>\n<p>All final exams will take place remotely in alternative formats.</p>\n<p>All managers are encouraged to provide opportunities for employees to work remotely when possible, while keeping their units open for business.</p>\n<p>Students who can do so are encouraged to move home as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>All U-M commencement ceremonies are canceled. We will look at ways to celebrate 2020 graduates in the future.</p>\n<p>Everyone is encouraged to avoid gathering socially in large groups.</p>\n<p>We have launched a one-time paid time-off bank for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>All final exams will take place remotely in alternative formats</p>\n<p>This essentially extends our previous action to prevent all classes from meeting in person. Faculty and instructors will communicate how this will be handled as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, classes remain canceled today but will resume Monday, March 16, delivered remotely in alternative formats. The Ann Arbor Provost’s Office has additional information and resources on remote instruction on our Keep Teaching at U-M page.</p>\n<p>Students will not be required to come to our campuses for instruction or exams for the remainder of this semester.</p>\n<p>Encourage opportunities for employees to work remotely</p>\n<p>I ask all managers to provide opportunities for employees to work remotely when possible while keeping their units open for business. This includes student employees. I recognize that not all work can be performed remotely, so I encourage flexibility and creativity. Michigan Medicine faculty and staff should refer to the telecommuting policy currently in place.</p>\n<p>U-M is taking this action to reduce the density of people in physical spaces. This aligns with the general public health principles to diminish disease transmission and protect everyone in our communities, particularly the most vulnerable, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.</p>\n<p>Employees who are sick need to stay home from work. All U-M employees who may be at greater risk should contact human resources in their school, college or unit or Staff Human Resources Services for assistance.</p>\n<p>Please note that we are not currently moving to our “reduction in operations” protocols, and that we recognize that there’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all plan that covers every U-M unit, given the size and complexity of our enterprise. This action to encourage working remotely will remain in effect until further notice, and we recognize there are additional challenges for many faculty and staff presented by the closure of K-12 schools.</p>\n<p>The university’s Work-Life Resource Center has information to support flexible work options, and the Remote Resource Guide we created contains technology resources to assist employees who are able to work remotely. The Ann Arbor Provost’s Office has additional information on remote instruction on our Keep Teaching at U-M page. Our Office of Research also has created guidance so faculty and staff can best manage their ongoing research and scholarship activities.</p>\n<p>To all employees, I very much appreciate your commitment to our university, students, parents, visitors and patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. The accounts of your dedication that I have heard are truly impressive, including supporting students, caring for patients, cleaning our buses and facilities, innovating to support our mission, or reaching out to support colleagues during a difficult time.</p>\n<p>We are an excellent university because of the people who work here.</p>\n<p>Students who can do so are encouraged to move home as soon as possible</p>\n<p>The university encourages students to go home to their permanent residences if possible. At the same time, we are taking additional precautions across the university to protect health and safety for everyone who remains on our campuses, including those who may not be able to leave. These include restricting traffic flows, stepping up cleaning, and canceling events to prevent interactions in large groups.</p>\n<p>U-M housing and dining operations, the University Health Service, and libraries will remain open to serve students who stay. We continue to urge everyone to practice social distancing of 5 to 6 feet when you are engaging with others.</p>\n<p>We’ve received numerous questions regarding pro-rating housing, dining, and other various school/college fees and we are examining this issue. We also ask that as students confirm plans, please complete the survey here to indicate if you intend to leave campus or to remain.</p>\n<p>Going home when possible will help to reduce the density of people in physical spaces. We recognize this may bring additional people to campus in the short term, but the reduction in density it will create over the next few weeks will help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It further follows general public health principles recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.</p>\n<p>All U-M commencement ceremonies are canceled</p>\n<p>We are canceling all Spring 2020 commencement activities across our three campuses. This includes both the large campuswide ceremonies and individual school, college and group recognition ceremonies. We know that this is very disappointing to many, and we are looking at ways to celebrate 2020 graduates in the future.</p>\n<p>Avoid gathering socially in large groups</p>\n<p>We need your help here, too. Gathering in large groups is not recommended – and this includes gathering socially. We strongly encourage you to limit interactions in groups this weekend and in celebrating St. Patrick’s Day. Reducing the density of people in physical spaces will help to prevent the spread of disease not just within our community but for society at large.</p>\n<p>Even in small groups, we strongly recommend practicing social distancing.</p>\n<p>These actions are based on general public health principles recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. They are designed to protect everyone in our communities, particularly those at higher risk from COVID-19.</p>\n<p>One-time paid time off bank for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>\n<p>To further minimize the impact of COVID-19, the university has established a one-time paid time off bank related to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, employees are eligible for up to 80 hours of paid time off to be used in the case of quarantine, isolation or family care needs related to COVID-19 exposure, illness or other related scenario or a temporary lack of work. This is a one-time bank of paid time off for use during the current pandemic.</p>\n<p>This one-time bank applies to faculty and staff on all campuses and in Michigan Medicine. Part-time and temporary employees, including student temporary staff, will be eligible for a prorated amount of time.</p>\n<p>More details about the policy and how to access this bank of time will soon be available on the University Human Resources website and from your appropriate human resources office.</p>\n<p>Additional updates</p>\n<p>The Washtenaw County Public Health Department has confirmed to the University of Michigan that a member of our community has tested positive for COVID-19. The individual who tested positive is self-isolating in Ann Arbor.</p>\n<p>The university has activated its emergency call center to assist those with COVID-19 questions specifically related to U-M responses. It will be available Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. at (877) 763-3040.</p>\n<p>The National Institutes of Health has made two announcements that may assist our research programs. The first allows institutions to apply for immediate financial support to assist with research operations during COVID-19. The second is NIH’s disaster policy, which allows latitude in items such as application deadlines, quarterly updates, adaptations in clinical trial protocols and staffing changes. We will post further details on the UMOR COVID-19 site.</p>\n<p>UMOR is announcing new restrictions for human subjects research in an effort to minimize the risk of contracting or spreading the virus, and also to preserve personal protective equipment for clinical care. Learn more at research.umich.edu/covid-19.</p>\n<p>There are everyday actions we can all take to help prevent the spread of all respiratory viruses:</p>\n<p>Stay home when you are sick.</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>\n<p>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</p>\n<p>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</p>\n<p>Consider alternatives to shaking hands.</p>\n<p>Unless you are sick with cough, sneezing and fever, it is not advised to wear a mask.</p>\n<p>Our health professionals are monitoring the spread of the virus and working closely with public health officials at the federal, state and local levels to protect health and safety. We will continue to post the latest information to our COVID-19 information page and I and other leaders will provide updates going forward.</p>\n<p>I again want to thank all of you for your diligence during these recent weeks. The rapidly changing situation due to the COVID-19 virus has created challenges across the breadth of our university, and I know that it has affected the work and personal lives of our students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Mark S.

This executive action directs all Minnesotans to stay home and limit trips outside the home to critical needs only. </p>\n<p>We anticipated this possibility as we planned our response to COVID-19 and we are prepared for today’s directive from the Governor. In fact, for most of us, the tremendous changes we have already implemented are closely aligned with the Governor’s action, and this will not significantly change the way we are currently teaching, learning, and working. We have already moved our coursework to alternative instruction formats, most employees are working remotely, and we have clarified the parts of our organization that must continue to come to work on campus under this stay-at-home scenario, among many other policy and operational considerations. Thank you for all you have done individually and together to ready us for this moment. </p>\n<p>Below is an overview of what the Governor’s order means for our University community: </p>\n<p>Purpose of This Action </p>\n<p>Stay-at-home executive actions are emerging across the country to limit broad community contact in an effort to slow the exponential growth of COVID-19 transmission—an important next step in our response to this pandemic. Public health officials have encouraged social distancing as a tool to stem the tide and Governor Walz’s order today aligns with that recommendation. For us, it means: </p>\n<p>• Do not leave your home or residence to go to work unless you have been informed by your supervisor that your job supports “critical services,” as defined by the Governor’s order. </p>\n<p>• Do not visit others outside your home or residence unless there is an urgent need to do so. </p>\n<p>• You may leave your residence for critical needs, such as buying groceries, picking up medication, seeking medical care, and other necessities. Providing care or support for a friend or family member in need is also allowed. </p>\n<p>• If you do need to leave your home to address a critical need or for outdoor activities, continue to practice social distancing (staying at least six feet away from others). </p>\n<p>University Operations and Exceptions for “Essential On-Campus Staffing” Plan</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, we communicated with you that we are now in an Extended Reduced Operations status. That status includes identifying positions designated as “Essential on-campus roles.” Only those of us whose positions have this designation (and received this direction from your supervisors) will continue to work on campus until further notice. The University was granted explicit exemptions in the Governor’s order that include, but are not limited to, all 16 critical infrastructure worker categories identified by the Department of Homeland Security.  </p>\n<p>In the case of the University, this includes staff required to provide: clinical patient care; childcare for health care workers and first responders; power plant and system utility operations; minimal sustaining care to irreplaceable research animals; staff specially trained to maintain hazardous or very high-value research equipment and materials; information technology and data center support; critical maintenance of University facilities and equipment; public safety; housing and dining services and others as designated under our Extended Reduced Operations status. </p>\n<p>Prior to today’s announcement, the University communicated with the Governor and his staff about the University’s Essential on-campus services and employees. I appreciate the Governor’s willingness to accept our recommendations to ensure the safety and health of our students remaining on campus and our critical healthcare and research needs. </p>\n<p>For our students who have no other viable housing options and remain in on-campus residence halls or apartments, please note that University housing and dining facilities will continue to be accessible to you. For students and staff who remain on campus, know that law enforcement and other emergency response personnel will continue to keep our University community safe and secure. </p>\n<p>Other University Actions </p>\n<p>Based on Governor Walz’s action and emergency declarations already issued by the state and local governments in our campus communities, I am planning to declare a state of emergency at the University of Minnesota pending Board of Regents action. This declaration does not change our Extended Reduced Operations status. It should not change how you’ve been approaching your teaching, learning, or work since our response to this public health challenge started. This declaration does trigger some important human resources policies, among others, that may be needed by a few of you at some point, such as an updated University emergency leave provision. This declaration also allows the University to seek state and federal resources to respond to COVID-19. </p>\n<p>We will continue to update this FAQ on our Safe Campus website as we learn more about this order and its impact on our community—but please know that we have been preparing for this moment so the disruption should be minimal to most of you. </p>\n<h1>StayHomeMN</h1>\n<p>Today’s announcement requires all of us to stay home as much as possible and to do our part to change the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the University, you have shown that anything—even this—can be possible if we are creative, committed, and take care of each other. I continue to be humbled and inspired by how you have pulled together in recent weeks. Please continue to share your successes using #UMNProud, and encourage others to #StayHomeMN. </p>\n<p>Be healthy, safe, and well. </p>\n<p>With warmest regards,\nJoan Gabel </p>","id":"3395f851-6793-5cdd-8ee6-c5e2dcd125d6","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-umn/2020-04-09-14_28_33/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Message from the Office of the President"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://president.umich.edu/wp-content/themes/um2014/images/umich-logo.png\"></p>\n<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered the university we love and affected every one of you – our students, faculty and staff. Missing are many of our traditional rites of spring, from seniors taking photos in their caps and gowns, to the walk-off victories of our softball and baseball teams, and faculty and staff on campus excited to close out another successful semester.</p>\n<p>The loss of each of these moments robs us of the closure and celebration that come with the season. Instead, our community fears for its health, is concerned about the economy and faces a major test of its resolve. Mounting uncertainties and new and ongoing challenges are disrupting how we pursue our education, research and patient care mission. These are anxious times, both for us as individuals and as a 203-year-old institution. I want to take this opportunity to share some of the actions we have taken in response to the pandemic –to address fast-changing circumstances, demonstrate our crucial value as a public research university, and be supportive of our students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Slowing the spread of COVID-19</p>\n<p>As health and safety guidelines have evolved, so has the university’s response. One of our earliest actions was reaching out to inform and assist U-M students abroad in areas where infection rates were highest. New recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and executive orders from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer followed in the days and weeks since.</p>\n<p>Our state went from its first positive case on March 11 to being one of the hardest hit in less than three weeks.</p>\n<p>I’m very proud of the way individuals from all parts of our university have responded. Collectively, we got the word out on the importance of social distancing and hygiene practices, provided expertise to elected leaders on virtually all aspects of COVID-19, helped those in need and transformed how we convene, work and learn.</p>\n<p>Serving the U-M community and our broader society</p>\n<p>Our focus on operations that are critical to our mission has resulted in several developments that are impressive and important in light of the current crisis. We’ve revamped the way we work, asked our students to change how they learn, and confronted the realities of having to operate in a world that has changed dramatically. These are the moments, created by you, that will come to define the University of Michigan in the spring of 2020.</p>\n<p>Michigan Medicine opened a special unit for COVID-19 patients, ceased many activities in order to increase capacity in critical areas, and implemented measures to protect patients and the health professionals on the front lines saving lives.</p>\n<p>Numerous teams have helped us tackle the pandemic as well, including reconfiguring patient rooms, procuring special equipment, stepping up cleaning, facilitating remote technology, and enhancing safety and security during rapidly changing conditions.</p>\n<p>Faculty moved winter, spring and summer courses to alternative modes of instruction.</p>\n<p>Researchers have ramped down labs, found ways to continue research remotely, and many are using their expertise to address COVID-19 across a wide variety of disciplines.</p>\n<p>Numerous staff are supporting students under often chaotic conditions, helping those abroad to relocate and supporting those living on or near our campuses.</p>\n<p>Human Resources implemented paid time off banks for employees affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to provide stability and support in March and April.</p>\n<p>Preserving financial resources wherever we can</p>\n<p>In the past few weeks, we’ve reduced university spending amid this uncertainty, while also maintaining pay for full-time employees through April. Actions include:</p>\n<p>Suspending all university international and domestic air travel, with rare exceptions requiring approval. We did this first and foremost to protect safety, and it also is financially prudent.</p>\n<p>Changing hiring guidelines for new and existing positions to include careful consideration of whether a role is critical during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Significantly reducing discretionary spending across U-M.</p>\n<p>The work each of you has already done to reduce spending has been appreciated. It is vitally important that we continue to remain focused on creative ways to continue to reduce discretionary spending as we move forward. We’ve incurred unpredicted expenses at the same time many of our sources of revenue have become less certain.</p>\n<p>Facing uncertainty</p>\n<p>The constantly evolving situation continues to call for more change. Michigan Medicine is preparing for the possibility of setting up a field hospital in anticipation of a surge in patients needing care, and we still cannot predict when it will be safe to return to more normal operations across U-M.</p>\n<p>U-M leadership is working closely with all of our schools, colleges and units to better understand and plan for longer-term realities of the pandemic. There is so much we simply do not know right now. We cannot yet be certain about how long we’ll be asked to stay home, future expenses, demand for classes, the nationwide economic slowdown, potentially greater needs for patient care, and projecting future levels of state support and federal stimulus measures. As we examine all of these factors and the effects of the pandemic unfold, there will be more difficult decisions ahead.</p>\n<p>Right now, we are asking everyone to use as appropriate the banks of paid time off for COVID-19-related absences as guided by U-M and the federal Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act (EPSLA). Throughout April, the university will provide the additional funds needed to cover COVID-related absences for any regular faculty or staff members who exhaust both banks of time. Additionally, we recommend judicious use of all available paid time off options because of the uncertain duration of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>With each passing day, the pandemic affects us on every level. We have lost or deeply fear losing friends and loved ones during a time when our ability to support each other is limited by the requirements of social distancing. We are enduring major disruptions to our work and personal lives and have been forced to refocus on how we deliver the most important aspects of our mission.</p>\n<p>I want to thank each one of you for demonstrating such high levels of professionalism and commitment – even as your own lives are upended. Your strength is the reason why we are able to teach, discover and care for the sick during this pandemic.</p>\n<p>I know that life is exceedingly difficult right now, and ask you to please take care of your physical and mental health and that of your loved ones. While social distancing remains essential, distant socializing is also strongly recommended. Keep in touch with one another, your families and friends.</p>\n<p>You have my utmost appreciation and gratitude. As a strong community we will overcome these difficult times. Thank you for your myriad contributions to our success and resilience, and stay healthy.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Mark S.

Please take advantage of the resources available to support you if you find yourself or your loved ones needing support. </p>\n<p>I have a couple of updates to share with you today: </p>\n<p>Alternative Formats for Summer Coursework While we manage through the immediate concerns and challenges presented by COVID-19, my leadership team and I are also considering plans for the intermediate and long-term future. Through it all, we continue to stay focused on several key principles in our decision-making: prioritize the health, safety, and well-being of all members of our University family; continue the teaching, research, and outreach mission of our University to the extent our circumstances allow at the highest possible quality; keep solutions as simple as possible; and communicate our actions transparently and regularly. </p>\n<p>With this in mind, registration will soon begin for summer term courses systemwide. We have decided that all upcoming summer term classes (for undergraduates, as well as for graduate and professional students) across the University system will be conducted through alternative instruction. In many cases, this will not be a significant change. We were already considering alternative methods of instruction for many of our summer term courses. Our Crookston campus, for example, has been a leader in alternative formats for many years and its summer courses were already planned to be exclusively online. </p>\n<p>Each campus will communicate with students and faculty this week about its specific summer plans for 2020, so keep an eye out for those messages. You will have all of the information you need in the very near future to make your summer academic plans. </p>\n<p>Board of Regents Meeting - April 7 The Board of Regents will meet again at 10 a.m. tomorrow. Meeting materials will be posted on the Board of Regents website after 7 a.m. The meeting will also be live streamed online. We anticipate this meeting will cover a lot of ground, including additional consideration of the start date for financial credits authorized by the Board on Friday, the significant steps we have taken in the last few weeks to position our students and institution for success, and the steps we now must begin to take to prepare us for the near and long-term future. </p>\n<p>COVID-19 Town Hall - April 7 I am hosting a systemwide Town Hall meeting tomorrow to discuss our University’s response to the public health challenges presented by COVID-19—past, present, and future. Students, faculty, and staff may submit questions in advance through an online form (U of M login required). Information for connecting to the live Town Hall from 4-5 p.m. will be available tomorrow at this link. </p>\n<p>It has been more than three weeks since we took our first significant steps toward slowing the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

These past few weeks have been a period of disruption, worry and loss. Many of you have had to return suddenly from study abroad programs that you had long looked forward to attending. Others have had to leave your residence halls and apartments just as springtime is arriving in Chapel Hill. Still, others have lost the opportunity to compete with your teammates. And all of you have had to say goodbye for now to campus life with friends who inspire you, and to the daily joys of face-to-face community with one another.</p>\n<p>It is important to acknowledge these losses and also to see that there is a way forward and trust that we will find it together. The same strengths that brought you to Carolina — your brilliance; your work ethic; your willingness to see the best in others — will help you respond to the current moment with courage, resilience and creativity. These strengths will also help you finish this semester and continue to make progress towards your degree and towards the life you want to lead.</p>\n<p>Over the last two weeks, your professors have worked tirelessly to prepare for remote teaching and learning. They know that this is an extraordinary time for you, just as it is an extraordinary time for them, and they are committed to responding to your questions and helping you make the most of the rest of the semester. If you need something from them, please just ask, and we are confident they will do their best.</p>\n<p>Below are resources available to support you as the semester resumes and remote learning begins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The University has provided <a href=\"https://registrar.unc.edu/files/2020/03/emergency-grading-accomodation.pdf\">guidance on emergency grading accommodations</a> for the spring 2020 term.

We are all being asked to do things that are new for us, including avoiding contact with others. However, infectious disease experts from our campus and beyond all agree this is a crucial step we must all take to slow the spread of the coronavirus.</p>\n<p><strong>It is important that everyone in our community practice social distancing.</strong>That means staying home as much as possible, going out only when essential, avoiding groups of 10 or more people and staying 6 feet away from others when you must be out.</p>\n<p>Remember the COVID-19 virus can be contracted and carried by someone without them knowing it, which makes it possible for you to give it to someone else without even realizing you are sick. It is important to protect yourself and so many people around you, including loved ones, who are at high risk of dying from this disease. It is also a selfless act of public service. Our health care workers and first responders are on the front lines fighting this disease, and we need to decrease the number of potential cases to avoid overloading our health care system.</p>\n<p>For those students still in Chapel Hill either on campus due to a special circumstances waiver or staying in off-campus housing, we understand getting outside and exercising are important to your physical and mental health. However, we are not permitting large groups on our sports fields or our campus. We encourage you to exercise on your own or with a partner at least 6 feet away. Moving forward, we will ask large groups to disperse, and you may be at risk of losing your special circumstances waiver if you continue to gather on campus.</p>\n<p>Please do your part to help “flatten the curve” by following these guidelines.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Kevin M.

This means that someone may have the virus and be able to spread it to others but not exhibit any symptoms, and of course they are not aware they have the infection.</p>\n<p>The University is hearing reports that students continue to gather in large groups off campus with disregard to the social distance guidance that we and others have continued to urge. This is more than asking our students to follow direction. This is a matter of significant public health safety. If our students are not following the orders to stay at home and practice social distancing and other safe hygiene practices, they may be transmitting the virus to the people they come in contact with unknowingly. This could include transmitting it to their parents, grandparents, pregnant women and newborns who appear to be in even greater danger of rapid and even fatal progression of the disease.</p>\n<p>We realize many students may be confused by early reports indicating that those aged 18 to 22 are not impacted by the disease. This is not accurate. Young people can catch COVID-19 and there are instances of even healthy people in their 20s being hospitalized and dying due to the virus. In addition, people of all ages who continue to socialize and participate in group activities can be what experts call “Super Spreaders,” who can create a large cluster of infected people among their friends and families. Such irresponsibility has the potential to place further stresses on our health care system, which is already working to manage a growing high volume of patients.</p>\n<p>Orange County and the Town of Chapel Hill have issued stay at home orders, effective March 27 at 6 p.m., and Governor Cooper has issued a stay at home order for North Carolina, effective March 30 at 5 p.m. UNC Police and the Chapel Hill Police Department will ask groups of 10 or more to disperse when they are identified, but we should not have to use our public safety resources to monitor this behavior during a pandemic.</p>\n<p>We urge you to speak with your young adults today, especially if they are remaining here in Chapel Hill on or off-campus, about the high stakes of their decisions. Please take time to have this family conversation. We have included several resources to help your conversations our <a href=\"https://www.unc.edu/coronavirus/students-and-parents-faqs/#chapter-30\">COVID-19 webpage</a>. We have communicated with them about the importance of social distancing, staying at home, and listening to the guidance of experts, and we will continue to do so. We are also asking for your help to reinforce these critical messages.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Kevin M. Guskiewicz<br>\n<em>Chancellor</em></p>\n<p>Robert A.

The situation is evolving quickly, and today the UNC System instructed all System institutions, including UNC-Chapel Hill, to significantly reduce all operations on our campuses. Protecting the health, safety and well-being of our campus community is our first priority; and secondly, we need to provide the best possible student experience that we can under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Below are changes that will affect all UNC-Chapel Hill students, faculty and staff, so please read this message thoroughly.</p>\n<p>Following the UNC System directive to significantly reduce campus operations and services, many of Carolina’s buildings will be closed and in-person, non-essential services will be suspended effective March 20 at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p>Exceptions will be made for a small number of emergency staff, administrators and researchers, as well as for students who are granted special circumstances waivers to remain in campus residence halls.</p>\n<p>Information for students</p>\n<p>Residence halls are closing to the majority of students</p>\n<p>Carolina’s residence halls and Granville Towers will be closed to all residents for the rest of the academic year, with few exceptions. For students currently on campus, we are encouraging you to begin moving out as soon as possible, but no later than March 21 at 5 p.m. A schedule for those currently away from campus who need to complete their move out will be made available soon. Guidance will come to residents directly from Campus Housing.</p>\n<p>Those who need to remain due to special circumstances will be able to apply for a waiver. Waivers will only be granted to those residents who complete an appropriate health screening and clearly establish that no other practical alternative is available. Please fill out this survey to request a special circumstances waiver.</p>\n<p>All other students should remain at, or return to, their permanent off-campus residence.</p>\n<p>Counseling and Psychological Services will continue to be available for students via the CAPS 24/7 line at 919-966-3658. A mental health professional will work with you to determine if an in-person or remote appointment is needed.</p>\n<p>Carolina Dining Services will be limited to take out</p>\n<p>Campus residential dining operations will be reduced to limited locations and will only offer takeout meals to the limited number of residents granted special circumstances waivers.</p>\n<p>Accommodations are available for remaining students in quarantine and isolation</p>\n<p>The University will make accommodations for quarantine and isolation if directed by a health care provider. This will be made available only for remaining residential students who have been granted a waiver to live on campus or students who live off-campus and use Campus Health as their primary health care provider.</p>\n<p>Carolina will make provisions for handling the quarantine and/or isolation should the need arise.</p>\n<p>Campus Health will remain open</p>\n<p>Campus Health will remain open for limited services. Call 919-966-2281 before going to the office in person.</p>\n<p>Facilities that support the academic and recreational pursuits of our students, faculty and staff will be closed, including the UNC Libraries (online consultation and services available), Campus Recreation, Carolina Union, Student Stores (extremely limited operations), classroom buildings, etc.</p>\n<p>Faculty will communicate your remote instruction details shortly</p>\n<p>Remote instruction will commence, as planned, on March 23.</p>\n<p>Faculty will confirm details for specific course remote instruction. If you have questions regarding specific course instruction, please contact your instructor.</p>\n<p>As part of the remote instruction commencing March 23, labs associated with coursework will no longer meet in person. Faculty will send students guidance on how that instruction will be delivered.</p>\n<p>Decisions on refunds will be made by the UNC System</p>\n<p>Any decisions regarding potential refunds for housing or dining fees will be made by the UNC System after April 1, or after the universities are beyond the immediate challenges being faced regarding the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>We will share more with you when we receive that guidance from the UNC System.</p>\n<p>Information for faculty</p>\n<p>While there is still work to be done this week, we currently estimate that 95% of our courses will be ready to be taught remotely starting March 23.</p>\n<p>Faculty are encouraged to deliver this remote instruction from off campus, if at all possible.</p>\n<p>If you are concerned about adapting your lab or course to remote instruction, please contact your dean for further guidance.</p>\n<p>While there has been no decision regarding a potential extension of the academic calendar, we are working with the UNC System and SACSCOC for guidance to ensure faculty retain discretion for their specific courses.</p>\n<p>Information for graduate students and postdocs</p>\n<p>For graduate students and postdocs whose work can be conducted remotely, telework options should be implemented, and work should begin away from campus immediately. See the below employee section below for teleworking and leave guidance.</p>\n<p>The Graduate School will provide guidance for thesis and dissertations.</p>\n<p>Information for researchers</p>\n<p>The University plans to keep critical research operations (as determined by the vice chancellor for research), labs and related facilities operational until further notice.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Research Terry Magnuson will follow up with additional guidance.</p>\n<p>Information for employees</p>\n<p>For this COVID-19 issue, the UNC System has changed the definition of mandatory employee to employees who are directed by their supervisor to report to work, at a designated University worksite other than their personal residence, at specific dates and times. It is possible that an employee will have a portion of duties that are on campus and can fulfill the remainder of their duties remotely.</p>\n<p>Effective immediately and until further notice, only mandatory employees under this new definition who need to report to work on campus should do so. All non-mandatory employees — including temporary employees and student workers — will continue to be assigned work and will be expected to work remotely to the fullest extent possible.</p>\n<p>Supervisors are responsible for designating mandatory employees, and for assigning and tracking their non-mandatory employees’ remote work. To be clear, these changes do not remove an employee’s responsibilities to complete their work assignments. Supervisors should work with HR representatives to ensure mandatory employee designations are logged in the ConnectCarolina system.</p>\n<p>Mandatory and non-mandatory employees — including temporary employees and student workers — who cannot work remotely for either of the following reasons will receive paid administrative leave until March 31 for the period of time they are unavailable to work. Because of childcare or eldercare needs due to COVID-19-related school and facility closings; or Because their position duties cannot be performed remotely and no alternate remote work is available or feasible.</p>\n<p>This guidance, which is provided by the UNC System, is effective immediately through March 31 and will be revisited as the situation evolves. Further updates will be provided.</p>\n<p>Employees who are sick due to symptoms of a cold, flu or COVID-19 or who are caring for a dependent with such symptoms will receive paid administrative leave for any time lost through March 31.</p>\n<p>More information about the new COVID-19 Leave Provisions, as well as additional guidance from the UNC System, is available on the Human Resources website.</p>\n<p>Campus parking guidance for students, faculty and staff</p>\n<p>Beginning March 18, on-campus parking is available in parking lots throughout campus for mandatory employees and students reporting to work.</p>\n<p>To ensure access in the event of an emergency and to maintain specific campus services, parking is not available in fire lanes or in accessibility and reserved spaces without the appropriate credential.</p>\n<p>The Dogwood Deck and Ambulatory Care Center are expressly reserved for patients and visitors only. To accommodate the many health care providers with UNC Health and the School of Medicine, these employees will be directed to primarily utilize Craige, Dogwood, Jackson and S-11 decks due to the close proximity to the medical campus. With this information, please plan accordingly with daily shift changes.</p>\n<p>Information regarding Commencement</p>\n<p>We have not made a decision about our Spring Commencement ceremonies on May 10. We will be seeking input from our graduating seniors should we need to make a change to our current plans.</p>\n<p>Carolina is, at its heart, its people</p>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, this is an unprecedented time for our campus. We realize this update presents challenges for everyone. This is not the Carolina experience we wanted for this semester, especially for our graduating seniors and graduate students.</p>\n<p>We appreciate your patience and flexibility as we make decisions for the health, safety and well-being of our community. Please stay safe and make it a point to stay informed on a daily basis. We will provide updates on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Carolina is, at its heart, its people. So many of you have come together to help our campus through the last few weeks, and together — even if remotely — we will work through these challenges and continue to thrive.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Kevin M.

Their guidance urges Americans to reconsider travel abroad due to the global impact of COVID-19. In light of these upgraded warnings and the University’s prohibition of travel outside of North Carolina, all summer 2020 study abroad and international education programs are canceled. This decision includes undergraduate, graduate and professional programs.</p>\n<p>We know this presents a significant disruption, and that you have been looking forward to an exciting, challenging and rewarding experience abroad for many months, if not years.

Over the past week, we have been inspired by the enthusiasm and imagination that so many faculty and teaching staff have brought to this endeavor, and we are grateful for your continued commitment to fulfilling the University’s core mission of teaching and learning during these difficult times.</p>\n<p>Our faculty continue to show great compassion for their students, and that has never been more evident than the past week as we contemplate the challenges all of you are now facing in this new reality. We all understand the uncertainty and anxiety that moving to a remote teaching format may cause our students, and we want to offer as much flexibility as possible to support the academic goals of our community. With that in mind, we write today to share an Emergency Grading Accommodation regarding grading for this semester. Among the key changes: beginning March 23, we will expand the pass/fail grade option to undergraduate students. Undergraduate students can elect the pass/fail option on undergraduate courses registered in the spring 2020 semester. Students, including undergraduates, enrolled in professional schools or programs in the Graduate School will follow the decisions of their professional school or of the Graduate School about which courses, if any, are eligible for the pass/fail declaration. Consideration for professional and graduate students will be made by their respective deans by March 27.</p>\n<p>We are making these changes in consultation with our deans, registrar, and the Faculty Executive Committee.</p>\n<p>Courses graded as pass/fail under this exception will count towards applicable curricular, major, continuation, and graduation requirements.</p>\n<p>A grade of pass will not count toward a student’s GPA but will count toward earned semester hours.</p>\n<p>Students will have until August 7, 2020 to elect to put a course on or take a course off of pass/fail for the Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>The Dean’s list recognition for the spring semester will be suspended.</p>\n<p>A note will be added to all academic transcripts indicating the major disruption this pandemic has caused to the academic experience.</p>\n<p>Further, for undergraduate students unable to complete their work because they are adversely affected by COVID-19, we will create a new grade of ‘CV’ as an alternative to the Incomplete (‘IN’) grade. Students with ‘CV’ grade designations will have an additional three months beyond the ‘IN’ guidelines to complete their work.</p>\n<p>We are making all of these modifications understanding the extraordinary circumstances COVID-19 has created for us all. Even with these changes, we know our students may face unexpected challenges. We are working to create a Student Success Hub so they can access the resources they need and will share those details as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we are grateful for the determination of our faculty and students to adapt and finish the next six weeks strong.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Kevin M.

In order to continue to mitigate the spread of the virus and keep our campus safe, we have determined that all summer 2020 courses (Maymester, Summer I and Summer II) will be delivered only through remote instruction. To allow greater opportunity for students to progress to degree, we will allow them to enroll in 9 credits in Summer I and 9 credits in Summer II, without requiring approval from their dean.</p>\n<p>Please note that the College of Arts &#x26; Sciences will suspend the regular “no pass/fail” Summer School grading policy and will extend the Spring 2020 Emergency Grading Accommodation through the Summer 2020 terms. The deans of the graduate and professional schools will continue to have full discretion and oversight of courses in their schools or under their purview, including programs with undergraduate students, to make decisions regarding pass/fail.</p>\n<p>Making the decision to transition summer courses to remote instruction will help professors get ahead on developing effective remote learning strategies and maximizing their pedagogical impact. Instructors will find many resources at keepteaching.unc.edu, including the opportunity for one-on-one consultation with a member of the Keep Teaching instructional design support team.</p>\n<p>We thank our faculty and staff for helping in the effort to keep students on track despite the academic disruptions caused by COVID-19. More than 1,650 undergraduates have been impacted by the cancellation of UNC-Chapel Hill’s spring and summer academic programs abroad. Many graduate students have had to alter their plans as well. We are determining what additional courses may be needed. Our preference is to maintain all current summer 2020 course offerings to preserve the widest range of academic options possible. We will be following up with some department chairs and instructors individually to fill gaps and possibly add courses in specific disciplines.</p>\n<p>We recognize that these are uncertain times and look to summer with great hope for a reprieve from these unprecedented circumstances. With a strategy in place that provides students with the academic options that they need, we will help them rebound and earn their degrees.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Robert A.

None of us expected – or wanted – the disruptions to this semester. We are now excited to return on Monday to teaching and learning, our most important work together as a Penn community.</p>\n<p>Along these lines, we are now writing with an update about grading options for the rest of this semester. We have decided that all undergraduate students, across the four undergraduate Schools, may choose to designate any course pass/fail for the Spring 2020 term – including courses satisfying your major or general education requirements. You may take as many of your Spring 2020 courses pass/fail as you choose, and you will have until the end of the day on April 13 to decide whether to take any course on a pass/fail basis. You must “opt in” to this expanded pass/fail option, and any courses taken on a pass/fail basis during Spring 2020 do not count against the total number of courses you may take pass/fail according to the policy of your School.</p>\n<p>We are confident that, next week, our great Penn faculty and students will continue the outstanding academic experience of this semester. At the same time, we know that many of you have concerns about the shift to remote learning and the stresses of this unexpected global situation. That is why we are offering all students the option to choose how to handle your grades this semester. We strongly encourage you to discuss your plan with your academic advisor in the weeks ahead.</p>\n<p>Thanks to all of you as we together navigate these unprecedented changes. We are determined to continue our most profound mission of education at Penn, and we will continue to keep you informed as the semester moves forward.</p>\n<p>Wendell Pritchett, Provost</p>\n<p>Beth Winkelstein, Vice Provost for Education</p>\n<p>Steven Fluharty, Dean, School of Arts and Sciences</p>\n<p>Geoffrey Garrett, Dean, Wharton School</p>\n<p>Vijay Kumar, Dean, School of Engineering and Applied Science</p>\n<p>Antonia Villarruel, Dean, School of Nursing</p>","id":"80db5e25-37ad-5422-b2cb-1772ba063ca9","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-upenn/2020-04-08-23_39_27/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"March 20 - Pass/Fail Options"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/sites/all/themes/penn_coronavirus/logo.png\"></p>\n<p>March 16, 2020 - I write today to share what I know will be disappointing for so many, as it is to me. Based on the recent recommendations of the CDC and leading public health experts, who are now directing against any public gatherings of more than 50 people for the next two months, we cannot responsibly plan to bring thousands of people to campus for our traditional Commencement and Alumni Weekend in May. To protect the health of our graduates, their families, alumni, and faculty and staff of the University—our highest priority in the face of this unprecedented coronavirus pandemic—we are cancelling this year’s on-campus Commencement events and moving them to a virtual ceremony that will be broadcast online.</p>\n<p>Given the uncertainty of when it might again be safe to bring such large groups together, and the rapidly changing scale of the pandemic, we know that this change is the only responsible action we can take.</p>\n<p>Many things have rapidly changed in our world in the past few weeks, and we know how difficult and confusing this can be. Commencement is such an important tradition at Penn, a time of abundant joy and pride, where we all publicly celebrate the extraordinary achievements of our graduates. While it will not be the same as our traditional ceremony, we are committed to finding the best way possible to recognize the achievements of the Class of 2020, and we will strive to make the virtual event as meaningful and celebratory as the circumstances permit. We are also exploring the possibility of an on-campus celebration for this year’s graduates that could be held in the fall. We will let you know details of that as they become clearer.</p>\n<p>I wanted to get this information to you as soon as possible, so that graduates and their families, along with our wonderful Penn alumni, can make appropriate plans. We will provide more specific details regarding the virtual ceremony as they are developed in the coming weeks. We will broadcast the events on the same dates as were originally planned for the on-campus activities so please hold those same days—May 16-18—for the virtual celebrations. There will be communication to Penn Alumni about the reunion celebrations later this week from Alumni Relations.</p>\n<p>I regret that this semester has been upended in so many ways. But in our lifetime the world has not faced a challenge as unique and complicated as the one that we currently confront.

Our faculty, staff, students, and medical personnel have stepped up in remarkable ways to tackle the most complicated and difficult period most of us have ever experienced. We are deeply grateful. We are steadfast in our commitment to keeping you safe and we are thinking of you, your families, and your working life as we weather this storm together.</p>\n<p>One of the ways we will get through this is by recognizing the realities we are facing and dealing with them head on. This is a monumental health crisis, and as a significant healthcare provider in Los Angeles, we care for the well-being of our community. And our great medical team is doing just that. At the same time, the economic effects of this pandemic are dire. U.S. jobless claims rose by 10 million in the past two weeks, manufacturing is grinding to a halt, and millions of Americans are sequestered in their homes. We are experiencing an unprecedented situation. No one knows how long it will last. But we are confident we will come out of this stronger.</p>\n<p>Now is the time for us to look inward to ensure that when USC emerges from this crisis, we will remain the thriving research university that has and will continue to make our community, our city, and our world a better place. We need to make some tough calls right now to address the serious financial consequences we face.</p>\n<p>Despite our resilience and liquidity, the magnitude of the shock will be significant. We are experiencing sizable additional costs associated with stopping the spread of COVID-19 in our 80,000 strong community and we are suffering a significant decline in many important sources of revenue. We are seeing slowdowns in philanthropy and declines in endowment value. We are also experiencing revenue losses from lower collection rates on student and donor receivables, reductions in clinical revenue, uncertainty about enrollment rates, and increased need for financial aid. Moreover, we are still dealing with the significant financial and cash ramifications of legacy legal issues, including the $215 million federal settlement in the Tyndall case.</p>\n<p>We are taking some immediate steps, as follows, to better position our University for the future. We did not make these decisions lightly but taking swift action now will leave us with more flexibility as this crisis unfolds. In the coming days and weeks, we will collaborate with leaders across the University on any future adjustments we may need to make to address the ongoing financial impact.</p>\n<p>Pause in Hiring – Effective immediately, we are pausing University-wide hiring for faculty and staff positions until further notice. Our objective is to focus support on our existing faculty and staff. Deans will review with the Provost the status of authorized, ongoing faculty searches and jointly determine which, if any, can proceed this spring. Additional guidelines, which will include an exception process, will be announced shortly.</p>\n<p>Pause in Merit Increases and Senior Leadership Compensation Reductions – We have decided to pause merit increases for both faculty and staff. Any staff exceptions must be approved by the Senior Vice President of Human Resources and the Senior Vice President, Finance. Academic exceptions must be approved by the Provost. Due to unprecedented challenges faced by the faculty and staff of our clinical enterprise and our first responders, a salary program will be developed for these groups. Groups in bargaining units will receive pay as dictated by contracts.</p>\n<p>The University’s senior leadership has volunteered to take a reduction in compensation. The President will be taking a 20 percent reduction, while the Provost, Senior Vice Presidents, and Deans will give 10 percent. The resulting funds will be donated to provide financial aid and emergency assistance to our undergraduate, graduate, and professional students as well as our employees.</p>\n<p>Pause on Travel – All non-essential USC business travel remains suspended until further notice.</p>\n<p>Pause on Discretionary Spending – We are pausing discretionary spending on food, meals, events, holiday parties, gifts, recognition banquets, and other expenditures that are not critical to the operation of the University.</p>\n<p>Pause on Capital Projects – We will re-evaluate all capital projects.</p>\n<p>Summer Programs – Given the uncertainty of when the campus will open again, all in-person summer programs and associated in-person activities will move to online offerings through the end of the first summer term. In addition, there will be no summer learning abroad programs. In late April we will evaluate if we can have in-person on campus activities for the second summer term.</p>\n<p>We understand the uncertainty that the COVID-19 crisis has created for our community and we are so grateful for how everyone is working together during these difficult times. Given the extraordinary nature of this crisis, we will continue to evaluate the global economic situation as well as our own, look for opportunities for improvement, and communicate regularly with you.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your dedication to USC.</p>\n<p>Fight On!</p>\n<p>Charles F.

Every student’s transcript will note that the semester was disrupted due to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>In addition, we are announcing that any future applicants to our undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools will not be disadvantaged by course work taken under Pass/No Pass grading options offered at any school during the COVID-19 pandemic. We understand students are working under unprecedented conditions, and we appreciate what they are going through. We are committed to evaluating all pass grades for course work without prejudice and are making this historic accommodation because we believe right now students should be able to focus on learning.</p>\n<p>Our deans, faculty leaders, and admissions officers all agreed these are the right steps to take, and we will continue to be as supportive as we can during this time. We will be posting an FAQ on the COVID-19 website before the end of the week on these policy modifications. Please check the site for updated information.</p>\n<p>We also know there are a lot of concerns and questions remaining about grading options at the graduate level. The provost is working with the deans on this, and we will issue FAQs in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Stay safe and well.</p>\n<p>Carol L. Folt Charles F.

Please note that students will have the ability to make this decision only during a one-week window after final letter grades are posted at the end of the semester by their instructors. Some classes will be exempt from this policy, and students are strongly advised to consult with their academic advisers and other faculty before making decisions. (This policy does not apply to students in the School of Law, as the law school will be communicating with its students separately.) Please review the full policy carefully. More details regarding exceptions, considerations, and the implementation process will be posted in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>I am keenly aware that the disruptions of the semester, including classes being moved online and students abruptly having to move off campus, have been incredibly stressful. We are all affected in different ways. USF is deeply committed to caring for the whole person, or cura personalis, and so it is my hope that having the option to elect a Pass (P) grade helps alleviate some anxiety. The well-being of each and every member of the USF community is what matters most and so we are doing everything possible to be flexible, to listen, to be patient, and to support one another during this time.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about grading options, please reach out to your academic adviser, faculty, or dean’s office.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Tyrone H.

Our highest priority is the safety and well-being of each and every one of you — especially at this very difficult, uncertain time in our history.</p>\n<p>Most campus events are canceled for the foreseeable future. Through the end of the semester, we are offering online classes, virtual learning environments, and robust student support services. With recent announcements — including the City of San Francisco’s shelter-in-place order; additional guidance from the CDC around social distancing; and the escalation of COVID-19 cases across the country and around the world — we are looking carefully at all of our decisions and examining what needs to be postponed or moved online.</p>\n<p>After careful consideration, we have decided that we will not be able to hold commencement ceremonies this May in St. Ignatius Church, so we are going to postpone them to a future date. It will also be necessary to postpone other campus commencement activities and celebrations until we are assured that we can safely convene as a community.</p>\n<p>Bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees will be awarded. As is our custom, diplomas are mailed to the addresses students provide when they apply to graduate. Final transcripts will reflect students’ degrees and their conferral date. We will send information as soon as possible to graduating students about procedures to obtain those important documents.</p>\n<p>To our students: I know in my heart that this is sad news for you, your families, and your friends. For each USF student, commencement represents the culmination of years of work, learning, and significant academic achievement — as well as the joy and gratitude that comes from gathering with the people who loved and supported you along the way. Commencement provides our entire community the opportunity to celebrate what our students have contributed to USF and what they will contribute to the world. This necessary change in schedule is also sad news for your professors, deans, and mentors — and for me.</p>\n<p>I am appointing a group comprised of representatives from across the university to study possibilities for alternative ceremonies and celebrations. I will charge the group with exploring creative ideas for how and when we will celebrate our graduates’ accomplishments here at USF. I will also ask the group to work as quickly as possible so that I can share an update with the community no later than April 15.</p>\n<p>I share this news about commencement changes to assure you that we are indeed committed to holding ceremonies and celebrations at a future date, in a venue and format that will best honor your accomplishments as members of this beloved university community. I also commit to giving our students and families as much time as possible to plan travel and accommodations for this celebration.</p>\n<p>All of us have had to adjust to many new realities in recent weeks, and there have been many challenges. This moment has required that we come together in new ways — even as many of us are working, living, and studying away from campus and dispersed across the country and around the globe. Already we are finding new and creative ways of relating and connecting to each other and the world. Guided by our Jesuit values that shape and animate our community, I am confident that each of us will find reasons to hope and grounds to trust that there will be much grace and many blessings as we learn to navigate this new way of proceeding.</p>\n<p>I eagerly look forward to celebrating the amazing accomplishments of the Class of 2020.</p>\n<p>My prayers are with you and your loved ones.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Paul J.

I know this is not the semester you were planning nor hoping for and I want to assure you that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to ensure that you continue to have an engaging and transformative USF experience.

Supervisors will also identify additional areas or tasks that may present opportunities for another student employee who may not be eligible for a remote working arrangement due to the nature of their job. Supervisors may contact Student Employment for support. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring appropriate remote working plans are in place, including agreed upon tasks, substantiation of their student employees work, and virtual check-ins throughout the semester.

These changes affect all members of our community, and include details that impact our employees’ working arrangements, our students’ online instruction, our faculty’s teaching resources, our residential students’ on-campus living situations, as well as important travel information for everyone at USF. I urge you to reference the myUSF resource page for more detailed information.</p>\n<p>We are taking these actions in support of the University of San Francisco’s commitment to protecting your health, safety, and well-being in accordance with our Jesuit mission, vision, and values. I realize that all of you (and your families) are dealing with anxiety, disruption, and uncertainty due to the spread of COVID-19. Please know that today — and in the days and weeks ahead — you and your loved ones are in my prayers.</p>\n<p>As we navigate this challenging time together, I am grateful for your patience, understanding, and flexibility. Every member of our community has adjusted their schedules and changed their established practices as USF has shared news and announced changes. It is what members of this community do for each other.</p>\n<p>We had hoped our intermediate steps would be sufficient, but it is clear that we need to take a next wave of actions to help slow the spread of COVID-19. These are very difficult actions to take, but we are asking individuals to make deep sacrifices for the good of those in our community who are most vulnerable to the threat of infection.</p>\n<p>I am so grateful for the flexibility and understanding of students and their families during this time. I am also thankful for the dedication of faculty, staff, and administrators who are working around the clock to help our community adapt to, prepare for, and support our students and one another during this public health crisis. Even if we are not in the same geographic location, I hope you know that we are companions for one another at this moment and through all that lies ahead.</p>\n<p>The Situation in San Francisco and the Bay Area</p>\n<p>Although we have yet to have a confirmed case of coronavirus on campus, we have community members who have had exposure to the virus. Late yesterday afternoon, Mayor London Breed announced that there are 23 cases of COVID-19 in San Francisco, at least 117 cases and one death in the Bay Area, and an increasing number of assumed cases by community transmission. Mayor Breed also ordered a series of restrictions* to be put in place, and encouraged private organizations and institutions to consider how we can work actively to reduce the spread of this virus, limit day-to-day interaction and activities, and focus on providing essential services.</p>\n<p>For the sake of our own community and our neighbors throughout the Bay Area, we must embrace the concept of social distancing and continue to work to minimize risk and exposure to our campus community.</p>\n<p>Remote Instruction Extended Through the End of the Semester</p>\n<p>In consultation with university leadership and deans, we have made the decision to extend our online instruction, which will begin March 18, through the end of the semester.</p>\n<p>This was a very difficult decision, but we knew it was the best choice as we prioritize the health and safety of our students and our community. USF, of course, is not alone. We are joined by nearly 150 colleges and universities that have had to make difficult decisions when facing this unprecedented global crisis. We all wish we were not in this situation.</p>\n<p>Students, faculty, and academic support staff are encouraged to review USF resources for how to keep teaching and learning through this crisis.</p>\n<p>On-site experience or other experiential learning required for progression and graduation in programs such as nursing and education will continue and will follow CDC guidelines.</p>\n<p>I trust that our students will continue to have transformative educational experiences as they connect with our talented, dedicated faculty online in the weeks ahead. Our professors and staff have stepped forward to prepare these courses, immersing themselves in trainings about online education and infusing that with the Jesuit, liberal arts approach we value. I’m so grateful to our staff and faculty who are committed to ensuring that our students have an outstanding educational experience.</p>\n<p>Residential Students</p>\n<p>We will only be able to provide on-campus undergraduate housing and dining for a very limited number of students — those who have no other option than to be here. We will prioritize international students who cannot go home; students who have known and severe health or safety risks; and students who currently are experiencing housing insecurity. Students will need to move out of their residence halls by March 21, 2020. Additional information, including about remaining in campus housing and exceptions to the move-out date, will be sent to all residential students on Monday, March 16, 2020. Please know that for those who remain on campus, there will be a number of actions taken to further reduce the risk of infection spread. For example, there may be no in-person programming for students; dining options will be limited; students may be asked to change residences; and students staying will be expected to remain on campus and not bring guests from off campus.</p>\n<p>Remote Work for Employees</p>\n<p>While we do not mandate telecommuting, we do want to increase the number of employees who are working remotely to the greatest extent possible, while doing so in a way that still supports the necessary operations of the university. Decisions about who can telecommute should be made in consultation with each dean, vice provost, or vice president (or their delegate) at the school or unit level. Please review the USF telecommuting and remote work policy.</p>\n<p>Travel Guidelines and Quarantine</p>\n<p>There have been significant developments in the global efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, including new local, state, and national health advisories regarding travel. As a result of the new advisories issued this week, USF has updated its travel guidance.</p>\n<p>In Conclusion</p>\n<p>This is not the spring semester you — or any of us — imagined. This time of the year is typically packed with anticipated and treasured events and occasions, lectures and gatherings. It must be particularly difficult and sad for our students to be separated from our campus at this time. But I have faith that our students will stay in close communication with friends and mentors wherever they are.</p>\n<p>At this time, I find myself reminded of how St. Ignatius and the early Jesuits talked about their communitas ad dispersionem — community in dispersion. In contrast with the older religious orders, who often lived, worked, and prayed together in a single monastery or convent, Jesuit communities spent much of their time scattered or dispersed in service to those in need. It wasn’t just that communities were dispersed; it was rather that the communities existed precisely to be scattered in this way.</p>\n<p>While we may be scattered temporarily during this time of disruption, wherever they are living, working, and studying, the people of USF are strong, supportive, and members of one beloved community.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Paul J. Fitzgerald, S.J.</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please note that the email of this message sent 3/14 had the incorrect link to the additional series of restrictions put in place by Mayor Breed on 3/13.

So much has changed during these past two weeks, yet when it comes to being a student, your goals have not. You came to the Forty Acres to get a UT education, and that’s what our faculty and staff members will continue to provide. We want every student to complete your classes this semester.</p>\n<p>It’s going to take teamwork. Your professors will bring their passion and expertise to your classes online, and I know you will continue to bring your enthusiasm, curiosity and dedication to your education.</p>\n<p>Grading Policies</p>\n<p>With the semester halfway complete, you have been working hard on your classes, and now you’ll also be adjusting to a new way of learning. Your professors recognize the challenges this will present, so through the end of the semester, undergraduate students will have the option of taking all classes Pass/Fail, and graduate students will have the option of taking all classes Credit/No Credit. This is not a decision that you need to make now. You will have until May 29 to make this choice.</p>\n<p>Getting Help</p>\n<p>If you have problems with the online technology, we have representatives available by email, chat (click the “Ask Bevo!” pop up) and phone (512-232-6988). We are providing technology for students with financial need who don’t have access to personal computers or internet connections, and we are also supporting students in need with food and housing. If you require help with any of these issues, please complete the Student Emergency Services form. And if you still have to retrieve belongings from a university residence hall, you can schedule a day and time here.</p>\n<p>Learning from Home</p>\n<p>As you study and learn from home, there are services available to assist you, including Keep Learning, a new digital resource dedicated to student success. Keep Learning provides tips and tools for navigating the transition to remote learning and staying on track toward earning your UT degree. It also has portals to helpful campus-wide support resources.</p>\n<p>Commencement</p>\n<p>As we work to adjust to our new reality this semester, there will be disappointments, particularly for those seniors and graduate students who plan to earn their degrees in May.</p>\n<p>UT commencement is unlike any other, and graduating students look forward to this special celebration of their achievement. Unfortunately, because of the public health risk to our community, we decided to postpone the physical Spring 2020 Commencement ceremony.</p>\n<p>To the Class of 2020: We will still honor you. We’ll be hosting a virtual ceremony in May, as well as a university-wide ceremony on the Forty Acres later in the year. Both of these events will feature your commencement speaker, Brené Brown, who is thrilled to have the opportunity to celebrate with you twice. There will be individual college and school ceremonies later in the year. It won’t be the same as in years past, but these celebrations will still be a tribute to our graduates.</p>\n<p>To all UT students, Monday is a continuation of your studies as well as a new beginning. You will rise to the occasion and thrive in your academic work. You will make the most of this opportunity, and I wish you all the best during the remainder of this unprecedented semester.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Gregory L.

Your professors and the campus are diligently preparing for the transition to new learning environments and are eager to support your academic success.</p>\n<p>I want you to know that I fully understand how hard this is on you, your friends and your families. My son was sent home from college last week and began his online classes yesterday. This requires an adjustment for the entire family as we make sure he has what he needs. We deeply appreciate your flexibility and patience during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>And we know that many of you are facing significant challenges right now: concerns about access to technology, housing, finances, and the health of yourself and your family. Please contact Student Emergency Services if you need support. Our central priority is doing what is necessary to help you. We want to be sure that you have what you need to be successful. This message is intended to address some of the academic questions you might have.</p>\n<p>What you can expect as classes begin</p>\n<p>Your professors and staff have been working tirelessly to prepare their remote classrooms for your return. We must ensure students have reliable internet access and computer equipment to engage in remote learning. If you need Wi-Fi or equipment for online classes, please contact Student Emergency Services and complete this online form for assistance.</p>\n<p>Instructors are being asked to communicate with you about their remote course plans by this Friday, March 27 at noon. Their plans will allow you to be prepared to complete the remainder of the semester and provide guidance on expectations and assignments.</p>\n<p>Technology Support for Remote Learning</p>\n<p>To support this unprecedented shift to remote learning, we have developed resources for students who lack personal computers or who have other technology access challenges that impede remote learning. (PDF)</p>\n<p>Q-drop and Withdrawal Deadline Extended to May 8</p>\n<p>We understand changes to your classes are significant. To support the transition to this new mode of course delivery, the deadline for Q-drops and withdrawals is now the last class day — May 8. Typically, students are allowed a maximum of six Q-drops, but Q-drops made this semester will not count toward this limit (this includes Q-drops during the first half of the semester).</p>\n<p>In addition, we will be making changes to our grading system. This may be similar to what our peer universities have done across the country and will allow for students to choose a Pass/Fail grading option in courses where that was not previously available. We have heard from students about their concerns about grading. We know that an option like this will alleviate many of those concerns, and you can expect more details later this week after Faculty Council has voted on this issue and made their recommendations to the president and myself.</p>\n<p>Regularly Check Texas One Stop Website</p>\n<p>Before classes begin and throughout the semester, Texas One Stop will have critical information about registration, tuition, and financial aid. This information will be updated frequently. Staff members are there to help you prepare and remain on track with your degree plan. Don’t hesitate to contact them if you have any questions. They are there to help you navigate through issues you encounter, and they want to support you in your progress toward graduation.</p>\n<p>Staying Healthy</p>\n<p>Please remember to access these services throughout the semester should you need them.</p>\n<p>University Health Services (UHS) is open to provide care for acute illness or injury, including evaluation of COVID-19. Call the UHS Nurse Advice Line — 512-475-6877 — for guidance about when to come to UHS, especially if you have a fever and respiratory symptoms. UHS can also schedule telehealth appointments at 512-471-4955 for some health concerns.</p>\n<p>The Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC) remains available for services over the phone, and the CMHC Crisis Line, 512-471-2255, operates 24/7.</p>\n<p>Take preventative steps, like regularly washing hands, adhere to social distancing guidelines and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Finally, please be sure to regularly check the UT Austin COVID-19 webpage for the most recent updates. You can also provide feedback and submit questions there so we can continue to respond and support you through this challenging period. Our goal is to preserve your academic experience and continue your educational journey as much as possible and ensure your success at UT.</p>\n<p>As you prepare to continue your classes next week through new online environments, I want to thank you in advance for your patience and resilience throughout all of this. This will be a considerable adjustment for everyone, but we are committed to helping you to pursue your goals through this period. I so deeply admire how well our community has responded, and we will continue to work to support you during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Maurie McInnis</p>","id":"a521d439-76a8-5d8b-be9f-6b959361d246","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-utexas/2020-04-08-23_43_28/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What you need to know when classes start"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://president.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/twitter_pres_emblem.png\"></p>\n<p>March 17, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear UT Community,</p>\n<p>I am writing to inform you of the latest actions The University of Texas at Austin is taking in response to the ongoing spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus). Starting on March 30, the university will be moving all spring semester classes online. We are asking students not to return to campus this semester unless there is a specific need. This decision has been made to protect the health and safety of all members of the UT community and reduce the spread of COVID-19 within the university and beyond.</p>\n<p>I’d like to extend my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to all staff and faculty members who are sacrificing greatly for the health, well-being and safety of our university community — especially health care workers, police officers, residence hall and janitorial staff members, IT staff members and many more. I am grateful for your service and selflessness.</p>\n<p>This decision today will create new challenges for many of our students, specifically regarding the completion of courses and credit (especially for students intending to graduate this year), housing, the retrieval of personal items from university residence halls and access to technology away from campus. Our goal is for all students to complete the courses they are registered for during the spring 2020 semester. I am directing faculty members, deans and university leaders to work to accommodate student needs throughout these difficult times.</p>\n<p>Below, you will find guidance and information on policies and resources for students, faculty members and staff members.</p>\n<p>Instruction</p>\n<p>When classes resume on March 30, undergraduate and graduate instruction will transition to remote delivery through Zoom, Canvas and other methods. Students will have the opportunity to complete the courses for which they are currently registered, especially those who are expecting to graduate this semester. Graduate courses will also be held online.</p>\n<p>There are exceptions to this. In these specific and unusual cases, such as clinical placements leading to professional licensure, we will review requests and faculty members will work directly with those students to make arrangements that adhere to social distancing guidelines.</p>\n<p>If you are a student who does not have off-campus access to a computer and/or Wi-Fi, please reach out to Student Emergency Services for support.</p>\n<p>We are asking students not to return to campus for course instruction after March 30 if they have living arrangements elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Residence Halls</p>\n<p>The university is requiring students to move home from their residence halls, though emergency housing will be available on a case-by-case basis to students who have compelling reasons to remain on campus, or who do not have other living arrangements. We will provide details for how to apply for emergency campus housing in the upcoming days.</p>\n<p>Residents who are currently on campus can begin to move out immediately.</p>\n<p>Students who are not currently on campus will need to sign up for a time to move out via the University Housing and Dining website starting on Monday, March 23. The university will also offer pro-rated refunds on housing and dining contracts and coordinate those decisions with financial aid packages.</p>\n<p>Recreational Sports and University Unions facilities are closed until further notice.</p>\n<p>Campus Operations</p>\n<p>Staff members who are working this week to support the university’s core priorities should continue to do so, and supervisors will continually assess the staffing needs as we prepare for the rest of the semester. As a reminder, these priorities are:</p>\n<p>Providing support to UT’s education and research missions in preparation for the transition to online learning;</p>\n<p>Maintaining critical mission services on campus such as public safety, utilities, core administrative functions, IT support for online learning, business operations and vital research functions; and</p>\n<p>Supporting students who are on campus, living in residence halls and relying on university services.</p>\n<p>As I wrote earlier this week, I am pursuing all options to preserve your compensation regardless of your work status.</p>\n<p>Research</p>\n<p>Some research — including efforts specifically related to COVID-19 — will continue, with social distancing procedures put into place in laboratories. All lab directors will make localized decisions about whether to maintain operations and are preparing shutdown procedures in case that is needed. Undergraduates will no longer participate in research in person. Graduate students may opt out of lab work at their discretion.</p>\n<p>Meetings and Events</p>\n<p>All on-campus programs, gatherings and events with more than 10 people through May 1 will be canceled, postponed or moved online. These include office or faculty meetings, student programs and religious or cultural celebrations in addition to all athletics events and public performances.</p>\n<p>As we get closer to May commencement, we will assess the public health situation to determine whether any public ceremonies are appropriate.</p>\n<p>In Closing</p>\n<p>Life on our campus, in our city and across the world has changed for the coming months. I have seen firsthand how extraordinary the UT community is, and I am proud of the dedication, compassion and leadership you have shown throughout these uncertain weeks.</p>\n<p>The university will keep you updated. Please continue to check our website to stay informed. Thank you for all that you do for UT. Please focus on your health and well-being during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Gregory L.

I know that this is a stressful time for everyone as we navigate the implications of the public health crisis and what it means for us, and our families, friends, communities and our work lives.</p>\n<p>The president’s message earlier today means that there is a lot of work for us to do to ensure instructional continuity for our students. It is also meant to address other questions we received about how the current situation has impacted your professional lives.</p>\n<p>As we transition to a new reality of remote teaching, meeting and research work life, we want to try to answer your questions, address your concerns, and respond to your suggestions. Please feel free to contact us by email.</p>\n<p>Instructional Continuity</p>\n<p>Beginning March 30, we need for undergraduate and graduate courses to transition to Zoom, Canvas, or some other mode of remote instruction. We know that courses take many different forms and that this necessitates considerable work to make this transition. We also know that you have many questions about this transition. We hope the following FAQs will help. There is also guidance about how to teach with technology here.</p>\n<p>More important than technology, however, is the support and care you provide to our students.</p>\n<p>Communication with Students</p>\n<p>We expect for every faculty member to communicate their plans with your students no later than 12 noon on Friday, March 27, with information about how each class will proceed beginning Monday, March 30th.</p>\n<p>Course Plans</p>\n<p>For accreditation purposes, it is critical that each faculty member fill out the Course Plan for Instructional Continuity form for each class. The link will ask for your plans for continuing instruction during this move to remote learning. For guidance, please see this document.</p>\n<p>Zoom license</p>\n<p>UT has purchased a new campus-wide license for Zoom that has been integrated with EIDs, Canvas, and existing Zoom licenses. You can create your Zoom account at: <a href=\"https://zoom.its.utexas.edu/\">https://zoom.its.utexas.edu/</a>.</p>\n<p>LAITS has additional information on this website: <a href=\"https://facultyinnovate.utexas.edu/instructional-continuity\">https://facultyinnovate.utexas.edu/instructional-continuity</a> that can help you get started using Zoom. And many of your Colleges and Schools are already offering excellent training and additional resources.</p>\n<p>Impact on faculty evaluations</p>\n<p>We know that faculty are concerned about how the COVID-19 disruption in teaching and research activities might impact your future evaluations. These concerns extend to include promotion and tenure, annual and mid-probationary review, comprehensive periodic review, teaching/learning ratings, etc. Please know that we are aware of your concerns and we are working on mitigation plans that will explicitly recognize the anticipated impact. We will continue to work on guidelines and procedures for handling this disruption.</p>\n<p>Impact on teaching evaluations</p>\n<p>The drastic change in course delivery from face-to-face to online is expected to impact students’ learning and may, therefore, alter course and instructor evaluation results. All faculty are strongly encouraged to document the challenges you encounter and how you worked to find solutions. We also strongly encourage you to engage the help of peers many of whom are skilled in online and remote instruction. The FIC and LAITS offer a number of resources as do many of the College and Schools’ teaching and learning centers that will assist you as you prepare to move to distance instruction.</p>\n<p>Impact on tenure-track faculty members’ scholarship</p>\n<p>We also understand that a tenure-track faculty member’s scholarly and creative productivity might be slowed by the impact of COVID-19. If this is true for you, consider applying for a probationary period extension (“extend the clock”). We also encourage department chairs, division heads and deans to discuss this option with their tenure-track faculty. Faculty members should request this extension as soon as it becomes apparent that their productivity has been negatively impacted. However, faculty will also be able to make the request for an extension retrospectively. Currently, Regents’ Rule 31007 limits the maximum number of probationary period extensions to two academic years (also see UT Austin’s HOP 2-2020). We have requested an exception for COVID-19 extensions and encourage any faculty member who meets the maximum to reach out to us to discuss.</p>\n<p>Bright Horizons back-up child- and elder-care</p>\n<p>In light of recent school district closings, it is critical for our faculty parents to read this: as a faculty member, you have access to the Bright Horizons Back-Up Care if your regular care is unavailable. The university has also opted-in to the Crisis-care program. This program is for faculty when situations significantly impact the availability of their network providers.</p>\n<p>Please follow these instructions to ensure you have access to the care you need for your family. Faculty members should notify Faculty Affairs if they experience difficulties connecting with Bright Horizons. It is also important to note, however, that this is a particularly challenging area of the current crisis. The first priority will need to be given to health care providers.</p>\n<p>Sick &#x26; Self-isolating Faculty</p>\n<p>If you are ill due to COVID-19 (or any other illness), unable to work or need to work part-time due to illness, then you should use sick leave for the hours that are missed. Department chairs, if you think a faculty member might need to apply for Family Medical Leave, please notify HR, which will send relevant information to the faculty member. Information summarizing sick leave and related policies for faculty members can be found here.</p>\n<p>These are unprecedented times. The top priority must always be the health and safety of our community. Please take good care of yourselves and your loved ones. I know that we will be there to help support one another as we transition into this new reality of being a community connected remotely. We are all figuring this out as we go along. We will have some stumbles. There will be some mistakes. But I know that we will figure out a way to continue instruction for our students, support one another, and, hopefully, flatten the curve of the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>We will continue to update you with information as best we can. And again, do reach out to me and my team using the faculty affairs email with any suggestions, questions and concerns.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>MAURIE MCINNIS | Executive Vice President and Provost</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Austin | provost.utexas.edu</p>","id":"f9372d43-c459-5e57-ae5a-8e9ce48cee19","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-utexas/2020-04-08-23_43_33/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 — transition to online instruction"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-wp0/wp-content/uploads/sites/327/2020/03/11114153/6280146331_9a6abc790a_o-1024x683.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Mar. 29, 2020 – Message from the Office for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and the Provost’s Office for Inclusive Excellence</p>\n<p>Many in our community are likely experiencing moments of anxiety and concern given the unprecedented times we are living in as a result of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>We also acknowledge that an unfortunate reality has emerged in communities around the world—an increase in expressions of xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiments, especially targeting the Chinese community.</p>\n<p>Please know that Vanderbilt continues to be committed to fostering a safe and welcoming community that is inclusive and respectful of differences. As a university, we condemn expressions of hate, bias and discrimination in all forms.</p>\n<p>If any member of our community has experienced harassment or bias related to concerns about the virus, or otherwise, we want to know as part of our commitment to creating and sustaining an inclusive community. Students should not hesitate to contact the Title IX and Student Discrimination Office to file a report about such conduct. Faculty, staff and postdoctoral fellows are encouraged to file a report with the Equal Employment Opportunity Office.</p>\n<p>We also encourage those who are feeling anxious, have experienced losses, or otherwise need support in coping with the impact of the coronavirus disease outbreak to seek assistance. Students may contact the Office of Student Care Coordination regarding support resources. For faculty, staff and postdoctoral fellows, the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is an important resource.</p>\n<p>If you have ideas or suggestions on ways that we can better support you, we encourage you to share them with us by sending an email to either the Office for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion or the Provost’s Office for Inclusive Excellence.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, please refer to the Vanderbilt University coronavirus website, particularly the FAQs, should you have any questions or concerns.</p>\n<p>Above all, please practice care for yourselves, your communities and each other, particularly during this time when social distancing can make many feel isolated.</p>\n<p>If there is anything that we can do to bring you clarity and comfort as these circumstances continue to unfold, we encourage you to reach out and let us know.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>André Churchwell</p>\n<p>Interim Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion</p>\n<p>William H.

We are making decisions based on the best information we have at any given time, and our staff is working around the clock to provide student support and assist with getting each student’s belongings back to them.</p>\n<p>That being said, we have an update on our campus residences. Vanderbilt will begin consolidating remaining students into a smaller number of residence halls on campus. Consolidation will allow us to better support the students remaining on campus in terms of managing facilities, providing meal deliveries, and ensuring adequate staffing in the buildings. We want to ensure students continue to feel safe and supported while on campus during this unusual time.</p>\n<p>The consolidation will also enable Vanderbilt to support Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). As the demands on health care may increase exponentially, Vanderbilt will assist VUMC by providing housing for medical staff working long hours and multiple shifts to address the expected surge in health care needs. VU will be able to assist VUMC through utilization of Vanderbilt facilities that are unoccupied after the consolidation of students who remain on campus.</p>\n<p>If you have already left campus, what does this mean for you?</p>\n<p>We know many of you departed campus, or did not return after spring break, and are eager to make plans to retrieve your belongings. Nashville Mayor John Cooper has declared a “Safer At Home” order until April 6. As a result, students will not be permitted to return to campus to remove belongings from their on-campus spaces until further notice.</p>\n<p>As a result of this planned consolidation, we may need to reassign current residents, and pack and ship, or store, belongings of already departed residents in certain residence halls. We will notify affected current and departed residents prior to taking any action. Please note that UPS, our preferred provider, will be granted access to student spaces for the purpose of packing and shipping or storing student belongings at the student’s expense. Multiple occupant spaces may pose challenges to identifying ownership of items and we may reach out to roommates to provide remote assistance in order to properly pack belongings.</p>\n<p>We are asking for your help.</p>\n<p>We have prepared a very brief survey that we are asking you to complete as soon as possible. The “Belonging Status Form” can be accessed in the Student Housing Portal under the Applications menu.</p>\n<p>The survey will ask if you have left campus, if you left belongings behind, if the belongings are packed and labeled, and other questions that will help us plan appropriately to assist you to the best of our ability. If you lived in a building we are seeking to clear for VUMC use, we will communicate with you before we begin boxing any of your belongings.</p>\n<p>We value and appreciate your cooperation as we do our best to support the critical health care workers serving our community during this crisis.

Wente’s full message to students graduating in May 2020 and their families:</p>\n<p>Dear graduating students and families,</p>\n<p>The historic circumstances of the last few weeks have required some of the most difficult decisions university leaders across the country have ever faced—and have brought about unprecedented challenges for graduating students and their families. Today, I write to you with one of the most painful decisions of all, and one that has been on my mind from the moment the COVID-19 crisis began.</p>\n<p>Based on current CDC public health recommendations for maintaining social distancing through mid-May, and after deliberation with the deans of all of Vanderbilt’s schools and colleges and with our Board of Trust ad hoc committee on university COVID-19 response, I have reached the profoundly difficult decision not to hold Vanderbilt Commencement ceremonies, or other related activities, for this academic year.</p>\n<p>In lieu of gathering on May 8, we are committed to holding a set of special events for you in May 2021. We envision these events in May 2021 as both a historic postponed Commencement ceremony and a one-year reunion for the Class of 2020. Although we are working to determine specific dates, we are planning for these events to be held between May 12 and May 16, 2021. I am launching the process of assembling a group of students from the Class of 2020 to give input into the planning of these events to help us ensure they reflect your hopes and expectations for this incredibly special moment.</p>\n<p>Please know your degrees will still be conferred when you have completed all requirements to be eligible to graduate, but no formal ceremony will be held in May 2020. Further, as they would have done in May 2020, the August and December 2019 graduates also will be welcomed for the postponed events in May 2021. For more information on degree conferral, please visit the Commencement website.</p>\n<p>This has been an incredibly difficult decision. Commencement is a sacred time that we all share across the Vanderbilt community as a way of recognizing and celebrating the remarkable achievements and diligent work of our newest graduates. Yet we are in a time in history that demands—first and foremost—the protection and safety of our students and their families. My heart truly aches knowing that we will not be able to celebrate in person on May 8.</p>\n<p>I have said before that this year’s graduating students’ resilience and ability to persevere through trying times are extraordinary. There is no doubt in my mind that you will use these circumstances to learn and to grow. Perhaps for some of you, it may even alter the course of your lives in a positive way, whether that comes in the form of discovering new ways to fight this disease or finding innovative solutions to help safeguard the public from future pandemics—or it may simply renew your spirit of empathy and compassion.</p>\n<p>As we move forward, I encourage you to stay focused on your studies, pursue your academic and professional goals with vigor, and remain connected to your friends, classmates, professors, advisers and the Vanderbilt community at large. We are here for you—today, this semester, on the day your degrees are conferred and for many years to come.</p>\n<p>With respect and admiration always,</p>\n<p>Susan R.

Although we are working to determine specific dates, we are planning for these events to be held between May 12 and May 16, 2021. I am launching the process of assembling a group of students from the Class of 2020 to give input into the planning of these events to help us ensure they reflect your hopes and expectations for this incredibly special moment.</p>\n<p>Please know your degrees will still be conferred when you have completed all requirements to be eligible to graduate, but no formal ceremony will be held in May 2020. Further, as they would have done in May 2020, the August and December 2019 graduates also will be welcomed for the postponed events in May 2021. For more information on degree conferral, please visit the Commencement website.</p>\n<p>This has been an incredibly difficult decision. Commencement is a sacred time that we all share across the Vanderbilt community as a way of recognizing and celebrating the remarkable achievements and diligent work of our newest graduates. Yet we are in a time in history that demands—first and foremost—the protection and safety of our students and their families. My heart truly aches knowing that we will not be able to celebrate in person on May 8.</p>\n<p>I have said before that this year’s graduating students’ resilience and ability to persevere through trying times are extraordinary. There is no doubt in my mind that you will use these circumstances to learn and to grow. Perhaps for some of you, it may even alter the course of your lives in a positive way, whether that comes in the form of discovering new ways to fight this disease or finding innovative solutions to help safeguard the public from future pandemics—or it may simply renew your spirit of empathy and compassion.</p>\n<p>As we move forward, I encourage you to stay focused on your studies, pursue your academic and professional goals with vigor, and remain connected to your friends, classmates, professors, advisers and the Vanderbilt community at large. We are here for you—today, this semester, on the day your degrees are conferred and for many years to come.</p>\n<p>With respect and admiration always,</p>\n<p>Susan R. Wente</p>\n<p>Interim Chancellor and Provost</p>\n<p>Vanderbilt University</p>","id":"65ccfefb-38cb-5e64-9d11-727102110d5e","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-vanderbilt/2020-04-08-23_47_49/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mar. 25, 2020 – Graduating Students and Families: Update on Commencement"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-wp0/wp-content/uploads/sites/327/2020/03/13115258/COVID19-featuredimage-1024x512.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Apr. 7, 2020 – Vanderbilt University prepares to assist VUMC; Housing to send students updates</p>\n<p>Dear Undergraduate Students,</p>\n<p>I sincerely hope this message finds you healthy and well as you continue your studies remotely. I wanted to share some updates on activity in the residence halls, spaces we know are your homes at Vanderbilt University.</p>\n<p>First, in consultation with the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the university has decided to use its campus residence halls to provide essential close-proximity housing for medical staff as they work around the clock to fight the global pandemic. Providing this housing option to medical staff on the front lines will allow them to continue their work while protecting their families by limiting their exposure. VUMC is one of the largest academic medical centers serving not only Tennessee but also the mid-South region, and we feel a deep responsibility to serve the community in these uncertain times by being the very best partner we can to our heroic healthcare providers.</p>\n<p>Second, this decision has some implications. The most obvious one is that we need to make those spaces ready as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>If you are among the students still residing on campus, you have already been notified that we are in the process of relocation. The purpose of this move is to enhance your safety and security as well as our ability to support you. Remaining students will each be assigned to living spaces with a bathroom and kitchen, a living room, and at least one bedroom. Housekeeping has increased its sanitizing efforts in residential common areas; security posts continue to be staffed; and Campus Dining has established a food distribution site for campus residents.</p>\n<p>If you are not living on campus, you will be asked to make an important choice regarding your belongings still on campus: Vanderbilt can pack, insure, and store your items on campus at no expense to you, or UPS can pack and ship your items at your own expense. When it is time for your residence hall to be packed, the Office of Housing and Residential Experience (OHARE) will contact you to provide more details and tell you how to indicate your choice. As a reminder, you can also apply to the university’s Hardship Fund for possible assistance with shipping.</p>\n<p>Third, unfortunately you cannot come back to campus now to do this yourself. Due to Nashville Mayor John Cooper’s Safer at Home order, which is currently in effect, students and/or their family members cannot return to campus at this time to retrieve personal belongings. If and when all travel restrictions and Safer at Home orders are lifted, and we can ensure that it is safe to do so, OHARE will communicate details and provide instructions about when and how to retrieve belongings from campus storage.</p>\n<p>In closing, I’d like to share an observation. Inside and outside of the classroom, some of my favorite conversations with students are about complex issues, issues raising questions and revealing needs that make us realize multiple things can be true and important at the same time. It is true that this is a difficult time for many of us personally and within our own families and relationships. It is also true that Vanderbilt needs to respond to this call to act by supporting our partners at VUMC as they care for residents from across the region. I send you my gratitude for thinking of others in our community and for supporting them as they carry out their mission. You came to Vanderbilt to expand your sense of your own mission and role in the world. Now, as we have this same opportunity as a university, it is important we step up and act. This unprecedented time in history gives us the opportunity to support a larger mission of service to the community and society at large.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, for the most updated information, visit the university’s COVID-19 website.

This includes evaluating all possible scenarios and necessary actions to support university operations after April 30, including any necessary changes to staffing levels and compensation.

I am grateful for the suggestions and feedback of many in our Villanova community—including faculty, students, staff, academic leadership and the University’s Academic Policy Committee—in helping to craft these options.</p>\n<p>In summary, all Villanova undergraduate and graduate students—excluding at this time those in the Widger School of Law (see note below)—may choose to earn Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grades rather than normal letter grades in any course in which they are enrolled this semester. Please see below for specific details and more information.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, the University continues to offer learning support, tutoring and career services online. These areas all have comprehensive websites and are ready to offer their services online. We encourage students to use these resources, which include:</p>\n<p>We remain committed to delivering a quality Villanova education, and thank you for your patience and understanding as we do our best to navigate the host of issues with which we continue to be faced. We hope that this option helps alleviate some of the stress and anxiety many of you may be experiencing during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Finally, please know we wish you and your family safety and good health during these unprecedented times.</p>\n<p>Warm regards,</p>\n<p>Patrick G. Maggitti, PhD</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>Spring 2020 Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grading Option Details (see also: FAQs for Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grading FAQs for Spring 2020)</p>\n<p>All undergraduate and graduate students may select S/U grading for one or more of their courses, including those that were designed from the beginning to be online. The Fitzpatrick College of Nursing will award S/U for all clinical practice courses rather than allow students to choose. The University and colleges have waived the normal rules restricting the use of S/U grading in Spring 2020 as follows: There is no limit on the number of courses for which a student may choose S/U grading. Courses in which a student earns an S grade will count toward the core curriculum, major, minor or certificate. All undergraduate students, including those in their first year, may choose S/U grading. The signature of the student’s adviser is not required for a student to select S/U grading. However, students are encouraged to consult with their advisers or staff in their colleges’ advising offices before electing this option. The S/U grade will continue to not count toward a student’s GPA. The S grade value remains a C grade or better; the U grade is for a C- or lower. Students have until the day after final grades are due to decide to use S/U grading in one or more of their courses. This approach allows students to see their final grades and then decide if they want to use S/U grading in a course. For the large majority of students, the deadline will be May 12, 2020. Note: Some courses using a non-standard academic calendar will have a different deadline. The student’s decision to select S/U grading is final. In order to select S/U grading, students must complete and submit an online form. The Office of the Registrar will notify students when the form is available.</p>","id":"8613f279-eb84-5a16-9448-0b2d88d0dea8","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-villanova/2020-04-08-23_27_09/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"March 25 Message from the Provost"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www1.villanova.edu/etc/designs/villanova/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>March 23, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Villanova Community,</p>\n<p>Although I have several updates and announcements to share with you, I want to start by saying that you and your families and friends have continually been in my thoughts and prayers. My hope is that you are taking care of yourselves, physically, mentally and spiritually.</p>\n<p>No one has been left untouched by COVID-19, and it is important—maybe more than ever—that we are here for one another. This past week has had an impact on us all, and I am grateful for everyone’s care, concern and flexibility. We have successfully moved classes online and are continuing to provide a Villanova education. While the transition wasn’t without its challenges, it highlights how Villanovans step up in times of trial. I continue to be inspired by the kindness of our community; grateful for the devotion of our faculty and staff and the perseverance of our students; and awed by the selfless efforts of everyone to keep Villanova moving forward.</p>\n<p>The situation surrounding the COVID-19 virus in our country has continued to escalate, and, as promised, we have closely monitored the advice of experts. I was hopeful that some of the difficult decisions shared below would not be necessary, but, like all of you, I have watched the additional precautionary measures being taken by government, business, institutions and individuals to safeguard our country and communities. Given recent developments, it became clear that we cannot return to our normal routine as quickly as we all had hoped. Therefore, I feel it is best for our community that we take the following actions:</p>\n<p>CLASSES and RESEARCH</p>\n<p>Classes will remain online for the rest of the spring semester. Given the most recent updates from health experts, it is no longer advisable or safe for students to return to campus as I had hoped. The Bursar’s Office will be providing information regarding prorated refunds and credits for dining and housing. If you left any belongings in your residence halls, we will continue to safely store your items. The Office of Student Life will reach out soon with details regarding retrieval.</p>\n<p>Given the most recent updates from health experts, it is no longer advisable or safe for students to return to campus as I had hoped.

Let me assure you that the small number of students who remain on campus will be supported for as long as they are with us.</p>\n<p>Amid this unpleasant news, there are some bright spots. I have heard from numerous faculty members stating that “you can teach an old dog new tricks,” as many have embraced online instruction. The Career Center staff is available to assist students and alumni with their employment needs. This is true for all of the support offices on campus, whether it’s Learning Support Services, the Student Health Center, Student Life, Campus Ministry or the Counseling Center—our staff is available and ready to help. I also appreciate the staff members from Dining Services, Facilities Management, the Student Health Center, Public Safety and others who have continued to report to the campus to serve the vital needs of our remaining students. And, thank you for the countless notes from people sending prayers for our community. Please know how grateful I am to everyone for making the best out of a very stressful situation.</p>\n<p>I am truly sorry that it has come to this point. Never could I have imagined the far-reaching and lasting impact COVID-19 would have. If anything, this whole situation is a good reminder for all of us. Going forward, let’s not take for granted the simple joy of an uneventful day or daily routines. Let us hope that we will soon be able to resume our normal activities. And let us come back stronger and more determined to live out our Augustinian values of VERITAS, UNITAS, CARITAS in everything we do. Throughout our history, Villanova has pulled through many difficult times, and we will do the same again.</p>\n<p>Let’s continue to be there for one another. Everyone is experiencing this—the anxiety, the uncertainty, the stress. Let’s make sure we are checking in on one another, helping those most vulnerable find resources—both physical and mental—and let us remember we are not alone. We are in this together, and together we will get through it. As Augustine reminds us:</p>\n<p>Let’s not allow past things to hold us back from hearing about what lies ahead; let’s not allow our involvement in present events to prevent us from thinking about the future. Let us look forward to the things that are to come. Don’t let the sweetness or bitterness of the past hide the word of God from you. Don’t let your past or present prevent you from looking to the future.

Approximately 2,400 instructors are now teaching about 4,500 sections via Canvas, Zoom and other distance learning systems. Academic advising and student support programs are also now being delivered electronically, with over 2,700 online appointments scheduled through the Navigate platform last week. The number of students living on campus was reduced from over 10,000 to approximately 800, thus allowing single occupancy accommodation of the remaining students, and student dining services have been limited to pick-up and delivery.</p>\n<p>These actions and many more are designed to mitigate the health risk posed by COVID-19 and would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of faculty and staff. While not everything has gone smoothly – for example, some students do not have adequate access to the internet – you nevertheless have enabled Virginia Tech to continue to educate students in the face of adversity.</p>\n<p>Read full statement</p>","id":"87d105aa-ca4c-5f86-8494-78a32b37047f","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-vt/2020-04-08-23_30_36/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mar. 31, 2020 - Executive VP and Provost Cyril Clarke; Dean Karen P.

The spirit of Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) has been shining through since we began to realize in late January that COVID-19 might strike at the heart of what Hokies value – coming together in communities of discovery and engaging with those we serve to solve complex societal problems in every corner of Virginia and around the globe.</p>\n<p>While necessary, I understand these changes have had a significant impact on our community. Nowhere is social distancing more apparent than on the Drillfield in Blacksburg, where April is traditionally characterized by gatherings of thousands of Hokies for the Big Event, Relay for Life, and the 3.2-Mile Run in Remembrance. Every day I speak with a student or parent who is adjusting to experiential learning opportunities that have been postponed or a hands-on laboratory or clinical experience that may not be possible. Students who remained in Blacksburg out of necessity have few opportunities for on-campus engagement, while the engagement of students who are staying at their primary residence is completely virtual. This week, we also made the difficult decision to move summer term academic programs, courses, and lab sections, as well as new student orientation sessions, Summer Academy, and all scheduled summer camps, conferences, and events to online delivery.</p>\n<p>For our seniors, their hard work and dedication is culminating in a last semester spent off campus and disconnected from the community they formed over the years at Virginia Tech. Graduate students, professional students, and researchers in Blacksburg, Roanoke, and our Agricultural Research and Extension Centers are dealing with the challenges of managing projects, clinical engagement, and research under restricted conditions. Faculty, staff, and students in urban regions of Virginia face the additional burden of operating in a region where the virus is currently more prevalent.</p>\n<p>As a continuing student you may be concerned about the experience you will have when you return to campus this fall. As of April 6, we have one confirmed positive case in Blacksburg and a small number of cases in the region. At our other sites, we have small numbers of cases and varying degrees of community spread. We are incredibly fortunate in most of Virginia to have had much more time to prepare for this pandemic than urban centers in some other states and around the world. I am impressed with the seriousness with which our community has taken the guidance to stay at home whenever possible. Yet, we have no illusions that we will escape this round of COVID-19 unscathed, even in Blacksburg, and models suggest that our peak will come in late April or May.</p>\n<p>Read full statement</p>","id":"2c4f1cf6-a93f-5c1a-b741-a1ded60b4ebb","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-vt/2020-04-10-14_01_41/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Apr. 8, 2020 - A message to students from President Tim Sands; Updates and Notices"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://assets.cms.vt.edu/favicon/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>From: Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost;</p>\n<p>Office of the Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer</p>\n<p>As Virginia Tech continues “essential operations” and campus safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the university will move summer term academic programs, courses, and lab sections to online delivery.

When using the Virginia Tech Remote Access Virtual Private Network (VPN) service, users should select ‘connect to VT Traffic over SSL VPN’ whenever possible. This improves internet performance for the user and leaves campus resources available for others who need them. Users should also keep in mind that connecting via VPN is not needed to access Canvas, Zoom, or the email and collaboration tools in Office or G Suite. The university has increased the capacity of the VPN to meet increased demands for the move to online learning for the remainder of the spring semester, however, capacity is not unlimited. The VPN makes it possible for users to access applications that are only available through a Virginia Tech IP address.</p>\n<p>Slack licensing fee reduced through June 17, 2020. To aid the university in slowing the spread of COVID-19 and make it easier for employees to stay connected while working remotely, IT Procurement and Licensing Solutions (ITPALS) is reducing licensing fees for the online chat tool Slack to $5.00 for a period of 90 days, effective immediately. The license will allow access to Slack through the annual renewal date of December 19, 2020. With telework now required for Virginia Tech faculty and staff whose jobs can be performed remotely, Slack can be a valuable communication tool, allowing employees to communicate instantly within teams as well as with individuals across the university.</p>\n<p>TLOS Top 10: Instructional Continuity Special Edition. The COVID-19 situation has dramatically altered the spring semester at Virginia Tech, and Technology-enhanced Learning and Online Strategies (TLOS) is doing everything they can to support the university's swift transition to online instruction.

At the end of winter quarter, you quickly transitioned, concluding your courses and final exams remotely in order to give your students the best academic experience possible. Because of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, we must pivot again and deliver all of our courses remotely for spring quarter in order to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff and community. We must strive to “flatten the curve” and help the outbreak subside, while continuing to educate our students as best we can.</p>\n<p>Through this, we must remember that a UW education, whether delivered in-person or online, is still an excellent education. UW faculty have always developed and delivered exceptional traditional, hybrid and online courses by drawing on their scholarly and pedagogical expertise. The challenges we face require that we draw upon this expertise and reflect upon our commitment to the wellness and success of our students and of the UW community as a whole. We write today to provide more information on the instructional program for spring quarter and how, together, we will continue the vital work of our University.</p>\n<p>Classes and instruction will be delivered remotely throughout spring quarter</p>\n<p>Spring quarter will begin as scheduled on March 30, with fully remote instruction that will continue through the quarter, which will end as scheduled, after final exams conclude on June 12, 2020. In-person classes will not be held. Our intent is to offer as many currently scheduled spring quarter courses as is reasonable. In some cases this will not be possible, and certain courses may have to be cancelled altogether, but we will make rescheduling those courses a priority for summer and fall quarters. All of us are deeply committed to helping our students make progress towards their degrees, and to ensuring that students graduate in a timely manner. This change to remote instruction will require significant adjustments in course pedagogy and delivery; at the same time, it represents the best way to maintain the instructional mission of the University.</p>\n<p>In cases where a student may require a spring quarter course for June graduation that, due to its nature, had to be cancelled, departments will be urged to either waive the requirement or identify substitute courses that satisfy degree requirements.</p>\n<p>Recognizing that changing to remote instruction presents a series of challenges, we ask that you follow these guidelines as you develop your courses:</p>\n<p>For undergraduate courses, treat the first week of the course as transitional. Together, you and your students are exploring – and learning – what it means to teach and learn remotely. Test the technology in a low-stakes manner. If your class is meeting synchronously (for example, through video conferencing), use the first meeting to review your course syllabus and discuss learning goals. This will allow you to “kick the tires” on the technology, assess connectivity challenges and provide a smooth transition to remote instruction. Please note that the first week must include instruction in order to meet accreditation and financial aid requirements.</p>\n<p>Together, you and your students are exploring – and learning – what it means to teach and learn remotely.

Craft a course that is sustainable and practical, and one that allows your students to achieve defined learning outcomes. Online instruction can be extremely effective, but it takes time and resources to optimize. We are asking you to do something different: transition your in-person courses to remote learning. We are not asking you to develop a highly-polished, complete online course ready for day one of instruction. Instead, we ask that you implement a viable and sustainable pedagogical and technological approach that will allow for remote delivery of your course. This way of teaching will be new to many of us, and there will be differences by field, discipline and the pedagogical styles we are familiar and comfortable with. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good!

As you have probably heard, the UW will be holding classes online for the duration of spring quarter, and you are likely wondering what that will mean for research. Even as many research universities around the country close their research facilities and buildings, I want to assure you that the UW is doing everything possible to keep our research programs open and productive, while also protecting the health and safety of our students, postdocs, faculty, and staff.</p>\n<p>My goal in this communication is to provide you with guidance and resources to help you in planning during this time when constraints due to COVID-19 are constantly evolving and changing how we conduct research. How we plan can minimize the negative impact we may experience. Here is how you can help.</p>\n<p>Research Considerations</p>\n<p>Make sure your research business continuity plan is up to date and share it with your group. Consider documenting critical step-by-step instructions.</p>\n<p>Please encourage everyone in your research group to work at home if they can. It is a great time to analyze data, write proposals and progress reports, and get caught up on manuscripts (especially working on that review you have been wanting to write). Students may be able to write the first chapter or two of their thesis, or work on a portion of an upcoming progress report or General Exam document. I encourage you to set up journal clubs and hold them remotely, if you have not already done so.</p>\n<p>Discuss plans with each member of your research team; it may be useful to have a regular remote check-in on weekly plans and progress. Remember, everyone should be able to find a way to stay productive even if they are working at home (see HR policy and advice).</p>\n<p>For those who continue working at UW research facilities, remind them to NOT COME IN IF THEY ARE SICK, and encourage frequent hand-washing.</p>\n<p>Maintain social distancing. If it is difficult to maintain social distance due to crowding, you will need to work out shifts and set up schedules so that the number of people working at any one time does not preclude the ability to keep social distance. Ensure that research team members are able to arrange personal interactions to maintain a comfortable six-foot distance from each other.</p>\n<p>If it is difficult to maintain social distance due to crowding, you will need to work out shifts and set up schedules so that the number of people working at any one time does not preclude the ability to keep social distance. Ensure that research team members are able to arrange personal interactions to maintain a comfortable six-foot distance from each other. Cross-train research staff to fill in for others who may be out sick or unable to come to work.</p>\n<p>Remember to be as accommodating as possible for the members of your research team; each person will have unique circumstances. Regular and frequent communication is key for your research group.</p>\n<p>If you feel that the best course of action for your research group is to ramp down your research activities, you should do so. Every situation will be different. If you do begin to ramp down, please be sure to address the issues noted below in the section, “Guidance for the Possibility of a Research Facility Shutdown.”</p>\n<p>Office of Sponsored Programs and Human Subjects Division</p>\n<p>The Office of Research has continuity plans in place so our work can continue. OSP is able to access all UW and sponsor systems remotely to e-support proposal handling, award acceptance, issuance of subawards, handling of non-award agreements, and pre- and post-award activities. HSD and the UW IRBs are fully functional and operating remotely at our standard capacity, however, please look for further messaging from HSD regarding a temporary halt of some human subjects research. Priority will be given to inquiries, requests, applications, and modifications related to SARS-COV-2 or COVID-19 research, or their impacts on other research. We are prioritizing our workload to accommodate changes in our work environment and we are strategizing to handle the expected increase in workload (within our current constraints) due to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Other Research Support Offices</p>\n<p>Please use the links listed below to access information on other research support offices. They are all open and functioning, and each has important information for research continuity.</p>\n<p>Building Access and Security</p>\n<p>Finally, for security, UW buildings have moved to a locked mode, similar to on weekends or holidays, so you and your research team will still have access. Your building coordinator will be working on plans for deliveries, but make sure you have a plan for communication with anyone who might not have after-hours access but has legitimate access needs (such as an undergraduate researcher or a repair person, for instance). You will need to call ahead for access to recharge facilities that are in a different building. Note that some of these facilities are curtailing hours and/or services, so it is wise to check in advance anyway.</p>\n<p>Although there are no plans to restrict access to UW research facilities to those who currently have after-hours access, this is a rapidly evolving situation and could change. As the Governor noted yesterday, they are considering all potential options. It is prudent to plan, just in case, and some ideas are listed below. In addition, as we have seen around the nation, two-week quarantines are a real possibility. Plan ahead and challenge your research group to consider what each would do if they could not come to the UW tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Guidance for the Possibility of a Research Facility Shutdown</p>\n<p>Prepare for a significant drop in support services on which you depend. By thoughtful planning you may be able to minimize the long-term impacts on your research.</p>\n<p>Make sure all data is backed up on the cloud, that all labile materials are stored appropriately, and that all instruments are shut down every night. Plan as if you may not have access tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Take stock of your inventory and pre-order reagents and supplies that have long shelf lives.

This means that all members of your committee may participate remotely.</p>\n<p>Those of you serving as Instructors of Record and Teaching Assistants should follow the guidelines from Provost Richards and Faculty Senate Chair Janes and also be in touch with your faculty mentors for advice. The Center for Teaching and Learning maintains a site devoted to Teaching and Grading During the Coronavirus Outbreak.</p>\n<p>All Academic Student Employee spring quarter contracts will be honored; however, there may be reassignments of activity.</p>\n<p>Additional information, including guidance on lab work, fieldwork, and public dissertation defenses, can be found in the Academic and Student Affairs FAQ. The UW’s COVID-19 FAQ remains your best source for general news and the latest updates. There are also a number of sites intended to address more specific sub-topics, as well, including the Registrar’s FAQ and the Mitigating Impacts to Research Activities page. We will continue to update these with new information as we receive questions and develop new resources and policies. If you wish to submit a question for inclusion in one of the FAQs, please send to gradnews@uw.edu.</p>\n<p>We ask that you thoroughly read the available FAQs and be in close contact with your faculty advisor as you plot a path forward. We also urge you to practice social distancing and self-isolate as much as possible.

Thank you, again, for your perseverance and goodwill as we navigate difficult, uncertain and rapidly changing times in our country and the world.</p>\n<p>Classes and instruction to be offered remotely throughout spring quarter</p>\n<p>Spring quarter will begin as scheduled on March 30, with remote instruction that will continue through the end of the quarter. As country-wide social distancing requirements continue to increase and evolve daily, we believe this is the best course of action for reducing uncertainty and anxiety and establishing a reliable, high-quality method of instruction and academic progress for UW students through the spring.</p>\n<p>At the outset of the quarter, you and your instructors will work together to establish class norms for teaching and learning remotely. They will offer a grace period with no written assignments due in the first week. Your instructors will also connect you with resources to support this transition, including online advising to support your questions about academic progress. As important, we will be developing online resources focusing on wellness and on how to maintain community and prevent isolation as we work together virtually to cope with the challenges of this ongoing public health crisis. Our faculty, staff and student leadership are here to help you both with your continued academic success and with new ways to engage in this uncharted chapter of your UW education.</p>\n<p>The quarter will end as scheduled, after final exams conclude on June 12, 2020.</p>\n<p>We recognize the nature of some courses precludes their being offered online due to the experiential nature of the content, or lack of access to required materials. We will be flexible with shifts in your schedule and hope to increase course offerings over the summer and fall to ensure access to classes required to meet major requirements. We will also provide, as much as possible, flexibility in requirements to support those nearing graduation, so as not to impede your post-graduation plans or opportunities. You can expect to hear more from your college or department soon about these and other issues. We also understand you likely have many questions. We have created a page with answers to many key questions about spring quarter and will be updating that frequently. Online student support services for advising, financial aid, libraries, counseling and career services will be available, and staffing adjustments are underway to expand our service capabilities. There will be no change in financial aid for full-time students enrolled in spring quarter who qualify for and planned to receive it.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that while there are many other practical details to attend to as we transition to a remote environment, a UW education, whether delivered in-person or online, is still an excellent UW education. Our faculty and staff are welcoming this quarter with a spirit of innovation and exploration, drawing on their scholarly and instructional expertise to create an active, engaging and experiential learning experience for students. We fully expect that for graduate and undergraduate students alike, research, vigorous inquiry, meaningful projects and a variety of programs and offerings will continue – online, but with the same creativity and commitment to quality that they do in person.</p>\n<p>Housing, dining and campus operations</p>\n<p>We expect that most students who returned home prior to spring break will remain there, and we encourage that. Housing and Food Services will send additional information directly to all students who currently have housing agreements with the University. We will provide those students with ample time to retrieve your possessions to ensure you have a smooth transition process.</p>\n<p>Our residence halls, along with limited dining services, remain available to students who need to reside on campus. All students who remain in campus housing will be required to stay in residence halls or apartments with private bathrooms to limit shared hygienic spaces and encourage social distancing. As mentioned, more information will be sent directly to all students who currently have housing agreements with the university.</p>\n<p>For those who do live on or near campus and wish to access campus services, modified operations will be in place. We continue to encourage all employees who can perform their work remotely to telework as per public health guidance. Those offices that remain open will have limited operations that minimize in-person interaction.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience, flexibility and dedication to your education. We understand how profoundly disruptive and disappointing this crisis is to your academic and campus experience, and we share your sadness and appreciate your sacrifice on behalf of those who are most susceptible to this virus. We also recognize that the loss of in-person community and remote learning can feel socially isolating, and we encourage you to reach out and stay connected. Be assured that we will do the same.</p>\n<p>As we deal with so much uncertainty, there is one thing about which I am certain – even from afar, we are a part of a great Husky family. Together, we will come through this, stronger, wiser and more deeply connected than ever before.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Ana Mari Cauce</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Professor of Psychology</p>","id":"52625cd0-863a-5865-a2f9-8d9b7840e12d","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-washington/2020-04-08-23_43_54/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"UW spring quarter classes will be held remotely (Message to students)"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uw-s3-cdn/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/21094817/Univ-of-Washington_Memorial-Way.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Learning remotely: Resources for instructors and students</p>\n<p>This message is being sent to instructors and students across the University of Washington.</p>\n<p>Dear Instructors and Students,</p>\n<p>Our first week in virtual classrooms has introduced a range of questions and concerns as well as new opportunities for all of us. What follows are summarized links to important information for both the short and long term, which supplements a special page with spring quarter resources that is updated frequently. You can also find answers to a range of questions related to the UW’s response to COVID-19 at the University’s novel coronavirus site.</p>\n<p>Learning and teaching remotely</p>\n<p>Teaching Remotely, hosted by the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL), provides instructors with resources for remote-course planning and teaching. Faculty who would like additional pedagogical and technical support from peers can participate in CTL’s Evidence-Based Teaching Program, while UW-IT and Learning Technologies offer workshops and resources on how to use various technologies for teaching. In addition, Faculty Senate leadership is working with my office on updated guidance for course evaluations, and I will send more information on that soon.</p>\n<p>For students, Undergraduate Academic Affairs offers a guide to online learning. If you are a student with an emergent financial need, I urge you to visit Emergency Aid. Instructors, feel free to direct students there, as well. The Race &#x26; Equity Initiative also has posted many resources for students.</p>\n<p>Grading</p>\n<p>For instructors, information and advice regarding grading options (numeric or Credit/Non-Credit grades) are addressed on the Teaching Remotely site.</p>\n<p>Students also have the ability to opt for a Satisfactory/Not Satisfactory (S/NS) grade, but we strongly suggest that students confirm with their advisers whether S/NS makes sense before choosing this option. Information regarding this option and other advice is provided through the Office of the University Registrar.</p>\n<p>Student registration fees</p>\n<p>Two registration fees have been suspended or eliminated. First, the late change in registration fee (add/drop) is suspended until April 13, providing an additional week for students to adjust courses without penalty. Second, the $25 late first-time (quarter) registration fee will not be charged for spring quarter. Students who have already paid this fee will be reimbursed. For more information, refer to the Office of the University Registrar.</p>\n<p>Using Zoom and security</p>\n<p>Like in-person classrooms, virtual classrooms need to be respectful, safe spaces for learning. UW-IT has provided methods for making classes via Zoom safer and protecting against misuse.</p>\n<p>Intellectual property and copyright</p>\n<p>The change to remote instruction has given rise to questions about the intellectual property rights of instructors. It’s important to note that nothing has effectively changed, aside from the sheer volume of materials being made available online to our students. Instructors have controls over the use of the materials they develop for their courses. More information regarding intellectual property and copyright can be found on Teaching Remotely.</p>\n<p>With gratitude</p>\n<p>President Cauce and I deeply appreciate your dedication to academic progress and excellence and recognize the significant amount of work by instructors and students to shift to remote learning in such a short time. We hope that this note clarifies a few important academic concerns and that you utilize these resources throughout the quarter.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Mark A.

Your resilience, ingenuity and generosity are powerful reminders that the University of Washington is not defined by where we are, but who we are. As our state continues social distancing and other practices that show signs of effectiveness, our University continues to plan for the future to ensure we serve our students and community well, both in this quarter and throughout the upcoming recovery and rebuilding.</p>\n<p>Commencement</p>\n<p>Commencement is one of the most joyous occasions in the life of our University, especially for students and their families. We all look forward each year to celebrating our graduates’ achievements and the great promise they bring to the world. Despite all our hopes to the contrary, it is now clear that in-person campus ceremonies in June won’t be possible. I am, however, looking forward to honoring all of our graduating seniors, graduate and professional students in two ways: First, with a one-of-a-kind, live, worldwide and interactive webcast on June 13, 2020. This dynamic and personalized experience will be the first time that graduates of all three of our campuses will have the opportunity to celebrate commencement together. Second, knowing the significance that a physical ceremony holds for many students, this year’s graduates are also invited to take part in and receive special recognition at the 2021 commencement exercises for all three campuses. Please visit the Bothell, Seattle or Tacoma commencement website for information specific to your campus.</p>\n<p>To the members of the Class of 2020, the persistence and grace you have demonstrated through these historic circumstances is extraordinary. Your achievements are even more impressive and inspiring in light of the hurdles that the pandemic has put in your way. It will be our great privilege to celebrate your launch into a global society that has never been in greater need of your talent and dedication. We will do everything in our power to ensure your virtual and in-person commencement exercises are meaningful, joyful experiences, made all the more memorable for you and your friends and family given the historic time your class finds itself in. Please consider participating in both!</p>\n<p>Summer quarter</p>\n<p>In order to put safety and health first, not only for our community, but for the public we serve, the full and A terms of summer quarter will be offered remotely. No decision has been made about B term, which begins on July 23, 2020. As we plan for B term and the start of autumn quarter in September, we are adjusting course offerings to backfill courses with clinical, lab, studio and practicum requirements that cannot be fulfilled remotely. Summer registration begins April 13.</p>\n<p>Your University’s vital role in the fight against COVID-19</p>\n<p>As we all continue the challenging work of adapting to circumstances, I’m deeply grateful for and proud of the extraordinary work happening across the community. Our heroic frontline health care workers are saving lives. Just yesterday, we announced that more than $20 million has been contributed by our community to the UW Medicine Emergency Response Fund and UW volunteers have collected more than 600,000 units of donated personal protective equipment for healthcare providers. Today, we are starting a campaign for the Student Emergency Fund to provide much-needed emergency support for our students, many of whom are continuing their education in extremely challenging circumstances as they feel the effects of this crisis.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has also brought into sharp relief how profoundly important our research and data science expertise are for grasping the scale of the outbreak and understanding what it will take to end it. Outstanding work is happening across our university to attack the problem from every angle. UW Virology has led the way in developing and ramping up testing capacity, as has the Center for an Informed Public in combatting misinformation and pointing to its serious consequences. In the Allen School of Computer Science &#x26; Engineering, a team is developing an app to allow health organizations to monitor coughs from COVID-19 patients self-quarantined at home. A UW geographer has created an interactive map to monitor the global spread of the novel coronavirus. Our School of Public Health is analyzing the economic impact of the crisis to predict who will be most affected, and the UW Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation is at the forefront of the national fight to flatten the curve through its data modeling and expert guidance to public health officials.</p>\n<p>When I launched the Population Health Initiative nearly four years ago, it was necessary to explain to people why it was important to look at health through more than an individual lens. We had to detail how the factors that most affect our well-being are ones shared by all of humanity, that health knows no geographic barriers and that our well-being is intertwined with that of everyone on our planet. Today, we are living that reality.</p>\n<p>This crisis has brought grief, anxiety and loss. It has taken members of our UW community and deeply affected many more. But it has also revealed the enormous strength at the core of our Husky family. As we navigate the challenges that lie ahead, we will continue to keep each other safe and advance the work and learning that we are passionate about. And we will emerge from this ordeal with our hope intact, rededicated to the mission that unites us.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Ana Mari Cauce</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Professor of Psychology</p>","id":"6ee0966f-d27e-5823-9247-3868a63baaa7","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-washington/2020-04-10-14_06_41/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Plans for commencement and summer quarter"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://prod.wp.cdn.aws.wfu.edu/sites/369/2020/03/C19_Covid-1920x1080-1.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Dear Wake Forest Community,</p>\n<p>My message today is one of continued gratitude. Thank you, to our faculty and staff working to sustain our vital educational mission through remote learning options. Thank you, to the essential staff still on campus delivering resources and support to approximately 400 students, who, out of necessity, still call our campus home. And thank you, to our students who are adapting to a new learning experience and adjusting expectations along with the rest of us for how this semester will play out. I am grateful to all of you for your flexibility in these unprecedented times.</p>\n<p>The public health community is now unified in their advice that we will not be able to resume in-person classes this spring. Therefore, Wake Forest courses will be delivered remotely for the remainder of the semester. This one decision has an impact on final exams, refunds for housing and meal plans, summer school and summer international trips, and the logistics of safely retrieving personal belongings from residence halls. Of significant importance to all graduate and undergraduate members of the Class of 2020, we must also rethink our plans for a traditional Commencement ceremony this May.</p>\n<p>Final Exams</p>\n<p>Final exams will be delivered virtually. The University has extended the pass/fail decision period (until April 17) to minimize the impact of final exams being delivered remotely.</p>\n<p>Academic deans will communicate with faculty about options and resources to support remote delivery of exams. Students should direct questions to their professors for information about expectations specific to each course.</p>\n<p>Refunds for Housing and Meal Plans</p>\n<p>Undergraduate students will receive a prorated refund for meal plans and on-campus housing and will receive information about their refunds on or before April 17. Please note, there is a high degree of variability based on room and board packages, and we have created different options to claim your refund. We are grateful to those families who have indicated a desire to decline any refund and to contribute these funds as a charitable gift to the Wake Forest Crisis Response Fund, and we will provide information about how to do so.</p>\n<p>Retrieving Personal Belongings From Residence Halls</p>\n<p>Wake Forest will continue to put the safety and health of students, their families and University staff among our top priorities. The University asks students and families NOT to travel to our Winston-Salem campus to retrieve personal belongings. Access to residence halls is currently restricted to those currently approved to be living on campus.</p>\n<p>On March 27, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper issued a “stay at home” order that runs through April 29. This order is in addition to the “stay at home” order issued earlier in the week by the mayor of Winston-Salem. These orders restrict travel and activities throughout the state with exceptions for essential activities as defined by these orders. On or before April 30, we will send an update about plans regarding retrieval of personal belongings, as well as options for storage of such belongings.</p>\n<p>Commencement for Class of 2020</p>\n<p>My heart goes out to the Class of 2020. I regret the need to postpone the opportunity to walk across the stage and hear your name called in front of your classmates, family, friends and faculty. We will soon address plans to celebrate your accomplishments in an email specific to each undergraduate, graduate or professional school.</p>\n<p>We will be in touch to seek your input to help shape the postponed Commencement experience. In general, you can anticipate two things:</p>\n<p>A virtual conferring of degrees on May 18 An in-person Commencement ceremony when it is safe to gather in large numbers (undergraduate, graduate and professional schools will each tailor a ceremony to meet the needs of their respective students)</p>\n<p>Future Academic Sessions</p>\n<p>Based on current information, we have made the following adjustments to future academic sessions:</p>\n<p>Summer Session I classes will not be held on campus, but opportunities will be available for remote and online classes.</p>\n<p>All summer Wake Forest-sponsored study abroad programs are regrettably cancelled.</p>\n<p>Our ability to hold Summer Session II classes on campus has yet to be determined, but remote and online classes will be available.</p>\n<p>We plan to conduct fall semester classes on campus.</p>\n<p>We plan to conduct fall semester Wake Forest-sponsored study abroad/away undergraduate programs as usual; if you have questions, contact the Center for Global Programs and Studies.</p>\n<p>Please note that these plans are subject to change depending on evolving circumstances, and an update will be sent should changes be required.</p>\n<p>This worldwide pandemic continues to stretch us all to think differently about how we create, share and acquire knowledge. It is redefining how we connect and how we celebrate. I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the way the Wake Forest community is facing each new challenge head on, moving together toward a better tomorrow.</p>\n<p>With great appreciation,</p>\n<p>Nathan O.

More details about this option are now available on the Office of the Registrar website.</p>\n<p>The message below (originally sent on March 26, 2020) and its reference to a special “Pass/Fail (P/F) grading option,” is superseded by the April 1, 2020 announcement.</p>\n<p>(Posted March 26, 2020)</p>\n<p>UW-Madison is in an unprecedented situation, faced with decisions that we have not navigated before. As a result, we are announcing a special Pass/Fail (P/F) grading option for students during the Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>Maintaining instruction and the quality of academics is and has been our most important campus goal, short of preserving the health and safety of our community. Recognizing that our lives have been significantly impacted by COVID-19, our grading and credit policies must adapt.</p>\n<p>We are planning to extend the time for students to elect a special P/F grade for a qualified course until May 22nd, 8 days after the final grade deadline. This approach is similar to those taken by several of our peer institutions. It will require adjustments to pass/fail rules and possibly other academic policies. Enacting these changes is complex.</p>\n<p>Under our new policies, just as before, students will receive a grade for any class they take, but also have the option to replace that grade with an alternative COVID-19 P/F grade for courses where this is allowable. We seek to extend this opportunity to most courses, undergraduate and graduate, but there will be exceptions, such as when strict program degree requirements or accreditor rules prohibit it. We will work to minimize these exceptions.</p>\n<p>We will provide information on policy details within the next few weeks, but we can share one detail now. P/F grades for this semester will be specially designated due to the COVID-19 crisis in a way that differentiates them from normal P/F grading.</p>\n<p>Our instructional staff and faculty have remarkably, in a 12-day period, adapted nearly 9,000 sections and courses to an alternative format that allows us to complete the Spring 2019-20 semester. Advisors and those providing other support services have made herculean efforts to bring their services fully online. Labs and other hands-on courses have had to radically shift their approach in this short window. Students are scattered around the nation and world, across time zones and with disparate access to high speed internet and other learning resources. To students, who are being asked to learn in new ways, and to all our students, staff, and faculty, we recognize the challenges the curtailment of economic activity and the variability of technology has on our lives.</p>\n<p>We care deeply about the well-being and learning of our students. We are inspired by our instructional staff and faculty and our advisors and other colleagues who support the academic enterprise.

I have also recorded a video message to the members of the Class of 2020.</p>\n<p>Of all the decisions we’ve had to make in this extraordinary time, this one has been the most heartbreaking for me. There is no better event at UW than commencement when we award degrees and celebrate the completion of school for our graduates.</p>\n<p>We held out on this decision as long as possible, in hopes that the outlook for late spring might brighten and we’d be able to gather as usual, but as you probably know, both the CDC and State of Wisconsin have put out guidance regarding gatherings of large groups of people. That means that in addition to the main ceremonies, graduation celebrations in schools, colleges, departments and campus organizations will also not go forward in May.</p>\n<p>These are important and necessary steps for the health of our community, but I know they add to the stress and uncertainty you’re feeling. The upheaval we’ve all lived through in the past few weeks has had a particularly deep impact on our graduating seniors. For you, this final semester should be about completing your degree and celebrating your years of hard work with your faculty mentors, classmates, family, and friends.</p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has changed many things. But it doesn’t change the exceptional achievements of the Class of 2020. You’ve voted in record numbers, helped to perform more than 30,000 hours of community volunteer work, and made UW-Madison the #1 university in the nation for Peace Corps volunteers. You are Rhodes Scholar finalists, national champion athletes, inventors, entrepreneurs, and dedicated students with the skills and passion to lead our nation and our world to a better place.</p>\n<p>In consultation with the senior class officers, we are developing a virtual commencement that we’ll post online on Friday, May 8, for all graduates to watch in celebration of the successful completion of your studies. Our students are also helping us design an in-person event that we’ll host when we emerge from this public health crisis, for everyone who can attend.</p>\n<p>Let me emphasize that the lack of an in-person commencement ceremony does NOT mean you are not graduating. We will share information about how you will receive your diploma as soon as we have it. You can continue to find important updates on our Commencement website.</p>\n<p>I am immensely proud of every one of you. You are living through the kind of moment that shapes an entire generation, and you’re doing it with grace, resilience, and compassion.</p>\n<p>Thank you. I look forward to offering my congratulations both virtually in May and in person later in the year.</p>\n<p>On, Wisconsin!</p>\n<p>Chancellor Rebecca Blank</p>","id":"69ed4ec5-b09b-52da-b7d3-8fd362461d0f","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-wisc/2020-04-08-23_42_59/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Our plans for May commencement"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://covid19.wisc.edu/content/themes/covid19-theme/dist/images/EOC-covid-update-03.png\"></p>\n<p>In consideration of the health and safety of UW–Madison students, Guido Podestá, vice provost and dean of the International Division, has instructed that all IAP study abroad programs and IIP international internships planned for summer 2020 be cancelled.

Law, Medicine, PharmD and Vet Med students should consult forthcoming guidance provided by their Dean.</p>\n<p>At the end of the Spring 2020 term, instructors will submit a standard grade to the Office of the Registrar. After the grade is received, students may choose to convert their letter grade in any course to one of two new grades: SD (Satisfactory-Disruption) and UD (Unsatisfactory-Disruption). The SD grade will count for all University General Education, degree/major, certificate, and PhD minor requirements and will satisfy future course prerequisites. The UD will not count for any credit.

We already had a robust online offering and in response, we are offering even more online courses than ever before so students can continue their academic progress.”</p>\n<p>UW–Madison Summer Term is experienced in the online space, having offered online classes for over 10 years.

This order reinforces the guidelines on social distancing and restriction on congregating in groups of ten or more people he previously recommended. The new order does not impact our current operations. The directive is based on the advice of national and state health officials and continues to mean that all employees who can telework should do so. Faculty who must be on campus to conduct a lecture, should maintain a dedicated footprint (enter by the same door, visit the same office, use the same restroom) while in a university facility and then leave campus as soon as possible. Essential personnel should continue to be in contact with their supervisors. While the COVID-19 outbreak is far from over, either in our region or nationwide, we are at a pivot point operationally on campus. Moving forward, in addition to communication from the Emergency Management Team you will also receive communications directly from departments and units. The university’s COVID-19 website will remain a central source of information. We encourage you to refer to it often. This site was redesigned last week, we hope you find that helpful. If you have a question that is not addressed in the FAQs, you may continue to submit them at the bottom of that page. Stay well and safe. Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>COVID-19 Update XVII: Office remain closed to public walk-in traffic, other updates March 20, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community, Last weekend we announced that university offices would be temporarily closed to the public for walk-in access. Given the advice of federal, state and local health officials, we are extending that restriction through at least May 1. University offices remain operational and all employees who can work remotely should plan to telework through at least the end of the semester. This measure is part of a coordinated effort to support social distancing and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our area. Employees should not be on campus just because they prefer to work from their W&#x26;M office. Additionally, any member of this community who has been asked by public health officials to self-quarantine or self-isolate must follow those directives and should not be on campus. Please understand that these steps are being taken with the health and wellness of our entire community in mind. Everyone’s cooperation is greatly appreciated. Essential employees should continue to be in touch with their supervisors for their assignments. There has been a lot of information on a variety of topics this week. Our COVID-19 web hub, www.wm.edu/coronavirus, is the best central source for all information related to the university’s COVID-19 response. Highlighted below are a couple of items announced this week: Residence halls will close for the remainder of the spring semester for all students on Wednesday, March 25. Details related to this closure are available on the Residence Life website. Any residential student, including graduate and international students, with an issue or concern related to this should contact the Dean of Students Office at deanofstudents@wm.edu. We want to emphasize that in these difficult times, we remain committed to our William &#x26; Mary values of belonging and respect. This office is assisting students, international and domestic, in identifying viable options for accommodation based upon their individual situations, and they are in touch with those students.</p>\n<p>In addition to university offices being closed to the public, university buildings are in a “locked, but not closed” status. Under this status, employees are reminded they need their card key or manual key to enter buildings. Students who are still on campus have access to their residence hall (until March 25) and the Commons.</p>\n<p>And a couple of academic updates: Pass/Fail . The Provost’s Office has announced that Pass/Fail grading will be available for undergraduate courses through the end of the semester. Additional details are available on the University Registrar’s No Decision on Commencement . As President Rowe announced in her March 19 message to the W&#x26;M community, any decision on Commencement has been postponed until April. Summer Study Abroad . In light of COVID-19 developments around the world, including the US Department of State Global Level 4 Health Advisory – Do Not Travel as well as increasing travel restrictions in many countries, W&#x26;M has made the decision to cancel all summer study abroad programs. Students and faculty directly affected by these cancellations have been notified, and we are working to help support students as they adjust their academic plans. Remote Teaching &#x26; Learning . All in-person classes will be taught remotely beginning Monday, March 23 and continuing through the end of the semester. Resources are available online to faculty, staff and students for both connecting remotely to university resources and faculty for remote teaching and learning strategies.</p>\n<p>Also, we’d liked to remind each of you to take care of yourself. We have all experienced a lot of change in recent weeks and we need to take care of both our physical health and mental health. To aid in this, the McLeod Tyler Wellness Center has transitioned its in-house services to online delivery. We understand they had 160 members of our community “at” a yoga class this week. See the options at www.wm.edu/wellness/virtual. On that site is a special article on flourishing during unexpected change. We hope it will be a valuable resource for this community as we explore how to healthfully manage the wide range of emotions and thoughts associated with this challenging time. In true W&#x26;M fashion, look out for yourself and one another.

With that in mind, effective this morning, William &#x26; Mary is instituting a “locked, but not closed” policy for all W&#x26;M buildings, including VIMS. This means W&#x26;M buildings will be locked and only accessible by electronic or manual key to faculty, staff and students who require entry. The university is also asking our community members to always lock doors behind them when entering a facility. If you require entry, but do not have a key, please contact W&#x26;M Police at 757-221-4596. William &#x26; Mary closed all offices to the public on March 16, and advised employees to work remotely wherever possible. Students have been strongly urged to physically leave campus if they can; only limited services are available and access may be restricted further in the coming days. The W&#x26;M Post Office is currently open with limited access from 8 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday through Friday. The post office can be accessed through the sliding doors next to the Sadler Center loading dock. Community members whose buildings are locked can call 757-221-4491 to make arrangements for pick-up or delivery. University leadership continues to work diligently on this situation and we will provide updates as we know more.

We announced earlier this week that all William &#x26; Mary campus offices would be closed to the public until at least March 23 as part of a coordinated statewide effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. Additionally this week, Gov. Ralph Northam also announced the state was banning gatherings of 10 or more people. The university remains operational and just those students with extenuating circumstances remain on campus with limited services.Given the rapidly changing nature of this situation, we encourage any of those students still on campus to leave if you can. If you cannot leave, we encourage you to be ready with your personal emergency evacuation plan should it become necessary for us to close residence halls. If you have questions, you may contact residence life at living@wm.edu. As a reminder, the www.wm.edu/coronavirus website is the most up-to-date source about William &#x26; Mary’s response.

Ralph Northam has issued a directive closing executive branch and state facility offices in the Peninsula Health District, which includes William &#x26; Mary. In support of this directive, the university is closing all offices to the general public, effective noon today, for one week through March 22. This includes all W&#x26;M campuses, including VIMS. Classes remain on schedule to resume via online and distance platforms on Monday, March 23. Online classes currently underway will continue uninterrupted. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience as we navigate this rapidly changing situation. Please review the following guidance related to today’s announcement: Telework Employees should contact their supervisors and plan to work remotely if at all possible. Advance approval is not required for telework. Essential personnel should report as normal, unless advised otherwise by their supervisors. Other personnel may need to report as requested by their supervisors. Emergency Leave According to the governor’s directive, hourly wage employees, including adjunct faculty, who are unable to telework may use Public Health Emergency Leave provided by the state. The employees will be paid based on the hours they are normally scheduled to work each week. HR will provide additional details to eligible employees. Limited Campus Services We strongly advise all students to physically leave campus if they can. While William &#x26; Mary is not open to the public, the university will continue to provide essential services to students who remain on campus due to extenuating circumstances. We will provide students with additional information today on modified dining operations. Resources and Training IT developed a resource page of tools to assist with employees’ telework. Additionally, employees who need to take university desktops or laptops home to facilitate their work may do so for the duration of their telework arrangement. Supervisors received an email last week from HR regarding two virtual training sessions this week on supervising teleworking employees. One is scheduled for today and the other is planned for March 19. Please plan to participate in one of these sessions. Supervisors who have urgent questions on matters related to telework and alternate work arrangements, please e-mail hrguy@wm.edu. Employees with questions should contact their supervisors. University leadership continues to work diligently on this situation and we will provide updates as we know more.

As of this notification, this is the first and only case of COVID-19 involving a member of the W&#x26;M community. That is very likely to change in the near future as more cases are diagnosed in the surrounding Williamsburg area. In accordance with privacy laws and our own policy, we will not be releasing detailed information about this positive case or any subsequent cases. The Virginia Department of Health is in the process of contacting people who may have been in close contact with this individual. If you have received a call from VDH regarding self-quarantine, please follow their instructions. If you have not received a call, you do not need to take specific action related to this case but please continue practicing good preventative hygiene measures and limit close interaction with others as much as practically possible. We are in contact with VDH and are closely following their recommendations. Please remember that amidst this serious pandemic, the vast majority of affected individuals will develop only mild to moderate symptoms. Preparation, not panic, will provide the best assurance that the health of our community is protected. The campus remains open and operating under the interim policies announced March 11. William &#x26; Mary is a close-knit community and we know this message will generate both empathy and concern. Please know we are doing all we can to provide this member of our community support and protect the health and wellness of our community.

Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>Back to the top Update XII: COVID-19 - Operational Details March 13, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – William &#x26; Mary leadership continues to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak and develop the university’s response. We want to provide you additional details on the interim policies President Rowe announced in her March 11 message. Information and links are below and please remember that www.wm.edu/coronavirus is the best source for all W&#x26;M-related information. Thank you to all members of the community who continue to reach out and contact us via the website question box and the Call Center. Your feedback and information is very helpful in our planning and communications. Yesterday, we posted detailed frequently asked questions for faculty, staff and students. We are also reopening the Call Center this afternoon until 5 p.m. That number is 757-221-1565. Here are some important updates and reminders: Working Remotely. Over the coming weeks the university will continue normal administrative operations, albeit with some adjustments. These adjustments — in relative order of priority — include a) utilizing telework if appropriate b) practicing social distancing in work spaces, c) using flexible scheduling of staff and d) developing creative solutions. The health and safety of our employees is a priority and following CDC guidelines for social distancing and hygiene are the first and best courses for action. If an employee does not already have a current telework agreement, they should start the approval process by speaking with his/her supervisor. Supervisors will be flexible in allowing employees who have appropriate work and are able to work remotely to do so. Ultimately, approval by the unit vice president, vice provost, dean or their designee(s) is required to telework during the COVID-19 emergency. That approval will be obtained by the supervisor. Not all requests to telework can be approved due to the nature of the job. HR will be providing training sessions for supervisors on telework principles and policies March 16 and 19.

Back to the top Update VIII: COVID-19 - Spring Break March 6, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community - Spring break is here. Please enjoy a safe, healthy and relaxing time. Many of you have had questions regarding campus events. At this time, the only changes announced by the university involve study abroad and university-sponsored international travel. Anyone taking a personal trip over the break is reminded to follow CDC guidelines regarding restricted travel locations and, in the case of international travel, protocols and requirements for reentry into the United States. Links to those resources are available at www.wm.edu/coronavirus. This website remains the best source for information and updates related to our campus community and COVID-19. Also included on that site are FAQs regarding actions the university has taken and preparations related to COVID-19. There is also a comment box should you have a question that isn’t already addressed in the FAQs. Feedback and questions received via our online form will help inform future campus messages and information we include on the website. Over the break, please pay extra attention to the recommendations of health officials for the prevention of catching and spreading COVID-19, especially washing your hands regularly with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face and following CDC guidelines for quarantine or self-isolation if you have traveled. Upon your return, we expect the university to be operating under a normal class schedule. The Emergency Management Team will continue to monitor this situation and inform you of any updates. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update VII: COVID-19 - Spring Break &#x26; Ongoing Communications March 4, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – As you prepare for spring break and potentially leaving campus, please pay close attention to recommendations and guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Virginia Department of Health. The status of COVID-19 is changing rapidly both the United States and a number of countries overseas. Domestically, Covid-19 is now reported in 13 states and more than 75 other countries worldwide. If you are planning personal travel abroad over the break, please be advised that travel warning and restrictions are very fluid. Leaving the country at this time includes the risk of potentially not being able to leave the country you visit and/or delays or quarantines in returning to the United States. Anyone who is not a U.S. citizen should be especially aware of the possibility of U.S. government restriction on reentry. State Department and CDC websites are the best sources of the most up-to-date- information related to overseas travel. All official information on COVID-19 and the university’s response to it will continue to come from the W&#x26;M Emergency Management Team (Sam Jones in your Inbox). The information we share is important and we ask that you review each of these messages carefully. The Reves Center, and its Global Education website, are the information source for those who are currently studying abroad, or plan to do so in the summer or fall. Please contact the Reves Center as you have questions. The university will continue to update the website <a href=\"https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus</a> on a daily basis so it remains a primary source for the most up-to-date information. Once you return to William &#x26; Mary, our focus will continue to be on prevention. All the standard rules apply. Wash your hands frequently and long enough to make a difference. Do not share water bottles, etc. If you are sick, go to the doctor. If you are sick, do not go to class, and faculty and staff should not come to work. Cough into you sleeve, or into a tissue which should be immediately discarded. Wipe down work and study spaces with a disinfectant. While these actions may seem basic, they are fundamental to preventing the spread of Covid-19 as well as other diseases. This video from Student Health Center Director Dr. David Dafashy is a good reminder of general COVID-19 information and prevention tips. Have an enjoyable and safe spring break. We look forwarding to seeing you back on campus and expect to be operating under a normal schedule for both classes and events. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update VI: COVID-19 - New Travel Restrictions March 2, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – You have likely heard that travel warnings to both Italy and Iran were elevated over the weekend due to COVID-19 outbreaks. Given these additional warnings, all university-sponsored undergraduate student travel is now currently prohibited to Italy, China and South Korea and all other countries on our restricted destinations list. This new prohibition means that undergraduate students may not remain in Italy on university-sponsored travel at this time. The university’s Global Education Office is working individually with any of our students impacted by this. No decisions have been made yet regarding summer study abroad. The university is currently assessing the viability of specific summer programs and will be in contact soon with applicants.

Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>Back to the top COVID-19 Update XVIII: Governor's \"stay-at-home\" order March 30, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam issued a statewide “stay-at-home” order this afternoon. This order reinforces the guidelines on social distancing and restriction on congregating in groups of ten or more people he previously recommended. The new order does not impact our current operations. The directive is based on the advice of national and state health officials and continues to mean that all employees who can telework should do so. Faculty who must be on campus to conduct a lecture, should maintain a dedicated footprint (enter by the same door, visit the same office, use the same restroom) while in a university facility and then leave campus as soon as possible. Essential personnel should continue to be in contact with their supervisors. While the COVID-19 outbreak is far from over, either in our region or nationwide, we are at a pivot point operationally on campus. Moving forward, in addition to communication from the Emergency Management Team you will also receive communications directly from departments and units. The university’s COVID-19 website will remain a central source of information. We encourage you to refer to it often. This site was redesigned last week, we hope you find that helpful. If you have a question that is not addressed in the FAQs, you may continue to submit them at the bottom of that page. Stay well and safe. Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>COVID-19 Update XVII: Office remain closed to public walk-in traffic, other updates March 20, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community, Last weekend we announced that university offices would be temporarily closed to the public for walk-in access. Given the advice of federal, state and local health officials, we are extending that restriction through at least May 1. University offices remain operational and all employees who can work remotely should plan to telework through at least the end of the semester. This measure is part of a coordinated effort to support social distancing and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our area. Employees should not be on campus just because they prefer to work from their W&#x26;M office. Additionally, any member of this community who has been asked by public health officials to self-quarantine or self-isolate must follow those directives and should not be on campus. Please understand that these steps are being taken with the health and wellness of our entire community in mind. Everyone’s cooperation is greatly appreciated. Essential employees should continue to be in touch with their supervisors for their assignments. There has been a lot of information on a variety of topics this week. Our COVID-19 web hub, www.wm.edu/coronavirus, is the best central source for all information related to the university’s COVID-19 response. Highlighted below are a couple of items announced this week: Residence halls will close for the remainder of the spring semester for all students on Wednesday, March 25. Details related to this closure are available on the Residence Life website. Any residential student, including graduate and international students, with an issue or concern related to this should contact the Dean of Students Office at deanofstudents@wm.edu. We want to emphasize that in these difficult times, we remain committed to our William &#x26; Mary values of belonging and respect. This office is assisting students, international and domestic, in identifying viable options for accommodation based upon their individual situations, and they are in touch with those students.</p>\n<p>In addition to university offices being closed to the public, university buildings are in a “locked, but not closed” status. Under this status, employees are reminded they need their card key or manual key to enter buildings. Students who are still on campus have access to their residence hall (until March 25) and the Commons.</p>\n<p>And a couple of academic updates: Pass/Fail . The Provost’s Office has announced that Pass/Fail grading will be available for undergraduate courses through the end of the semester. Additional details are available on the University Registrar’s No Decision on Commencement . As President Rowe announced in her March 19 message to the W&#x26;M community, any decision on Commencement has been postponed until April. Summer Study Abroad . In light of COVID-19 developments around the world, including the US Department of State Global Level 4 Health Advisory – Do Not Travel as well as increasing travel restrictions in many countries, W&#x26;M has made the decision to cancel all summer study abroad programs. Students and faculty directly affected by these cancellations have been notified, and we are working to help support students as they adjust their academic plans. Remote Teaching &#x26; Learning . All in-person classes will be taught remotely beginning Monday, March 23 and continuing through the end of the semester. Resources are available online to faculty, staff and students for both connecting remotely to university resources and faculty for remote teaching and learning strategies.</p>\n<p>Also, we’d liked to remind each of you to take care of yourself. We have all experienced a lot of change in recent weeks and we need to take care of both our physical health and mental health. To aid in this, the McLeod Tyler Wellness Center has transitioned its in-house services to online delivery. We understand they had 160 members of our community “at” a yoga class this week. See the options at www.wm.edu/wellness/virtual. On that site is a special article on flourishing during unexpected change. We hope it will be a valuable resource for this community as we explore how to healthfully manage the wide range of emotions and thoughts associated with this challenging time. In true W&#x26;M fashion, look out for yourself and one another.

With that in mind, effective this morning, William &#x26; Mary is instituting a “locked, but not closed” policy for all W&#x26;M buildings, including VIMS. This means W&#x26;M buildings will be locked and only accessible by electronic or manual key to faculty, staff and students who require entry. The university is also asking our community members to always lock doors behind them when entering a facility. If you require entry, but do not have a key, please contact W&#x26;M Police at 757-221-4596. William &#x26; Mary closed all offices to the public on March 16, and advised employees to work remotely wherever possible. Students have been strongly urged to physically leave campus if they can; only limited services are available and access may be restricted further in the coming days. The W&#x26;M Post Office is currently open with limited access from 8 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday through Friday. The post office can be accessed through the sliding doors next to the Sadler Center loading dock. Community members whose buildings are locked can call 757-221-4491 to make arrangements for pick-up or delivery.

As of this notification, this is the first and only case of COVID-19 involving a member of the W&#x26;M community. That is very likely to change in the near future as more cases are diagnosed in the surrounding Williamsburg area.

The Virginia Department of Health is in the process of contacting people who may have been in close contact with this individual. If you have received a call from VDH regarding self-quarantine, please follow their instructions. If you have not received a call, you do not need to take specific action related to this case but please continue practicing good preventative hygiene measures and limit close interaction with others as much as practically possible. We are in contact with VDH and are closely following their recommendations. Please remember that amidst this serious pandemic, the vast majority of affected individuals will develop only mild to moderate symptoms. Preparation, not panic, will provide the best assurance that the health of our community is protected. The campus remains open and operating under the interim policies announced March 11.

We want to provide you additional details on the interim policies President Rowe announced in her March 11 message. Information and links are below and please remember that www.wm.edu/coronavirus is the best source for all W&#x26;M-related information. Thank you to all members of the community who continue to reach out and contact us via the website question box and the Call Center. Your feedback and information is very helpful in our planning and communications. Yesterday, we posted detailed frequently asked questions for faculty, staff and students. We are also reopening the Call Center this afternoon until 5 p.m. That number is 757-221-1565. Here are some important updates and reminders: Working Remotely. Over the coming weeks the university will continue normal administrative operations, albeit with some adjustments. These adjustments — in relative order of priority — include a) utilizing telework if appropriate b) practicing social distancing in work spaces, c) using flexible scheduling of staff and d) developing creative solutions. The health and safety of our employees is a priority and following CDC guidelines for social distancing and hygiene are the first and best courses for action. If an employee does not already have a current telework agreement, they should start the approval process by speaking with his/her supervisor. Supervisors will be flexible in allowing employees who have appropriate work and are able to work remotely to do so. Ultimately, approval by the unit vice president, vice provost, dean or their designee(s) is required to telework during the COVID-19 emergency. That approval will be obtained by the supervisor. Not all requests to telework can be approved due to the nature of the job. HR will be providing training sessions for supervisors on telework principles and policies March 16 and 19. Contact HR for details. Emergency Leave. With Governor Northam’s declaration of a state of emergency, university employees have access to Emergency Health Leave. This leave is available to both salaried and hourly employees and may be used for an employee’s own illness or to take care of an immediate family member. The leave is for illness or care directly related to COVID-19 and is to be used prior to any existing leave an employee may already have. Please contact HR if you have questions regarding eligibility. Residence Hall Access. Yesterday, Residence Life provided detailed information regarding residence hall access and student services. Swem Library has modified operating hours on its website and a list of building access times is available on the university’s COVID-19 website. Grading Guidance.

Additionally, the deadline for undergraduate, graduate A&#x26;S and marine science students to withdraw for a grade of “W” from full-semester classes has been extended to Monday, March 30. Online instruction. As a reminder, the university has prepared this website to support the online instructional, remote learning and technology needs of faculty, students and staff as we transition to remote and online platforms. COVID-19 exposure/suspected exposure. Anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to a positive case of COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider. Staff should also call their supervisors, and faculty should also call their deans. Students on campus should call the Student Health Center. Supervisors and deans should contact the Emergency Management Team and the Student Health Center. We will continue to update you regularly as the situation warrants.

Back to the top Update VIII: COVID-19 - Spring Break March 6, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community - Spring break is here. Please enjoy a safe, healthy and relaxing time. Many of you have had questions regarding campus events. At this time, the only changes announced by the university involve study abroad and university-sponsored international travel. Anyone taking a personal trip over the break is reminded to follow CDC guidelines regarding restricted travel locations and, in the case of international travel, protocols and requirements for reentry into the United States. Links to those resources are available at www.wm.edu/coronavirus. This website remains the best source for information and updates related to our campus community and COVID-19. Also included on that site are FAQs regarding actions the university has taken and preparations related to COVID-19. There is also a comment box should you have a question that isn’t already addressed in the FAQs. Feedback and questions received via our online form will help inform future campus messages and information we include on the website. Over the break, please pay extra attention to the recommendations of health officials for the prevention of catching and spreading COVID-19, especially washing your hands regularly with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face and following CDC guidelines for quarantine or self-isolation if you have traveled. Upon your return, we expect the university to be operating under a normal class schedule. The Emergency Management Team will continue to monitor this situation and inform you of any updates. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update VII: COVID-19 - Spring Break &#x26; Ongoing Communications March 4, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – As you prepare for spring break and potentially leaving campus, please pay close attention to recommendations and guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Virginia Department of Health. The status of COVID-19 is changing rapidly both the United States and a number of countries overseas. Domestically, Covid-19 is now reported in 13 states and more than 75 other countries worldwide. If you are planning personal travel abroad over the break, please be advised that travel warning and restrictions are very fluid. Leaving the country at this time includes the risk of potentially not being able to leave the country you visit and/or delays or quarantines in returning to the United States. Anyone who is not a U.S. citizen should be especially aware of the possibility of U.S. government restriction on reentry. State Department and CDC websites are the best sources of the most up-to-date- information related to overseas travel. All official information on COVID-19 and the university’s response to it will continue to come from the W&#x26;M Emergency Management Team (Sam Jones in your Inbox). The information we share is important and we ask that you review each of these messages carefully. The Reves Center, and its Global Education website, are the information source for those who are currently studying abroad, or plan to do so in the summer or fall. Please contact the Reves Center as you have questions. The university will continue to update the website <a href=\"https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus</a> on a daily basis so it remains a primary source for the most up-to-date information. Once you return to William &#x26; Mary, our focus will continue to be on prevention. All the standard rules apply. Wash your hands frequently and long enough to make a difference. Do not share water bottles, etc. If you are sick, go to the doctor. If you are sick, do not go to class, and faculty and staff should not come to work. Cough into you sleeve, or into a tissue which should be immediately discarded. Wipe down work and study spaces with a disinfectant. While these actions may seem basic, they are fundamental to preventing the spread of Covid-19 as well as other diseases. This video from Student Health Center Director Dr. David Dafashy is a good reminder of general COVID-19 information and prevention tips. Have an enjoyable and safe spring break. We look forwarding to seeing you back on campus and expect to be operating under a normal schedule for both classes and events. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update VI: COVID-19 - New Travel Restrictions March 2, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – You have likely heard that travel warnings to both Italy and Iran were elevated over the weekend due to COVID-19 outbreaks. Given these additional warnings, all university-sponsored undergraduate student travel is now currently prohibited to Italy, China and South Korea and all other countries on our restricted destinations list. This new prohibition means that undergraduate students may not remain in Italy on university-sponsored travel at this time. The university’s Global Education Office is working individually with any of our students impacted by this. No decisions have been made yet regarding summer study abroad. The university is currently assessing the viability of specific summer programs and will be in contact soon with applicants. If you have additional questions regarding study abroad visit the Reves’ Global Education Office webpage. Centralized information and resources related to COVID-19 are available at <a href=\"https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus</a>. Please continue to reference this site for the most up-to-date information. The Emergency Management Team continues to look at the best preventative actions for the university moving forward and the administration will ask each department and unit on campus to think about its continuity of operations plan should COVID-19 spread to our region. Again, all of this is preparatory. To date, there remain no confirmed cases of the disease either at William &#x26; Mary or in the state of Virginia. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and the Virginia Department of Health are encouraging anyone who has not yet had the flu vaccine to get one. If you have not had a flu shot this year, please consider doing so. Most local pharmacies are good sources for the vaccination.

Sam Jones, emergency management team chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update IV: New Travel Advisories/Spring Break Feb. 26, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – The university and its Emergency Management Team are monitoring developments here and around the world related to the COVID-19 virus. We are closely following university policy as well as guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the Virginia Department of Health. Thankfully, there remain no reported cases of the virus at William &#x26; Mary and no confirmed cases in Virginia. Yesterday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued additional travel warnings based on growing reports of COVID-19 cases in Europe and Asia. With spring break just a week away, we wanted to be sure to alert you to those updates. Currently, CDC recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to both China and South Korea. Additionally, they advise travelers to consider postponing nonessential travel to Iran, Italy and Japan due to the growing number of cases in those countries. Spring Break and Other Travel Spring Break runs March 7-13. Please follow all travel restrictions or warnings issued by the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the State Department if you are planning to travel outside the country. Based on CDC and State Department warning levels and in adherence with university policy, all university-sponsored undergraduate student travel is currently prohibited to China and S. Korea. All university-sponsored faculty, staff and graduate student travel to those countries must be reviewed and approved by the university’s International Travel Review Committee. As we have previously communicated, information related to overseas travel is available on the Reves Center’s Travel Alert page. Travel warnings and alerts are quite fluid; if you are planning to travel overseas please continue to reference this webpage. Health Matters For any questions you may have related to COVID-19, its symptoms, reported illnesses and how it can spread the most up-to-date and detailed information is available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Virginia Department of Health. Preventive measures for COVID-19 are the same as those recommended for colds and seasonal flu. The CDC recommends the following guidelines – stay home when sick; wash hands regularly; avoid touching public surfaces; cover nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing; seek medical care if feeling ill. Students may contact the Student Health Center at 757.221.4386. We expect additional guidance from the U.S. government over the next 24 hours and will share any new information at that time. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update III: Informational Health Advisory – Novel Coronavirus Dear William &#x26; Mary community –</p>\n<p>Health officials continue to report rising numbers of novel coronavirus COVID-19 cases, particularly overseas. While there have been several additional cases reported in the United States there remain NO confirmed cases in Virginia. The few illnesses in northern and central Virginia that were under investigation have all been cleared.</p>\n<p>Spring Break and Other Travel</p>\n<p>As you know, Spring Break begins March 7. As you begin to look toward your plans for that period, we encourage you to follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the State Department if you are planning to travel outside the country.</p>\n<p>For anyone planning university sponsored travel we remind you that given CDC and State Department warning levels for China in adherence with university policy, all university-sponsored undergraduate student travel is prohibited to China at this time. All university-sponsored faculty, staff and graduate student travel to that country must be reviewed and approved by its International Travel Review Committee.

Thank you.</p>\n<p>We recognize this is an incredibly stressful time—not only academically, but in your personal lives as well—which is why we have made the decision to update our policy on course grading for this term. This is to give you a choice in how your grades are recorded for one, some, or all of your classes.</p>\n<p>The WPI faculty have approved a special grading option for D-Term 2020:</p>\n<p>All undergraduate students will have the option to select either a Pass/NR grade scale in place of WPI’s usual A/B/C/NR scale.</p>\n<p>to select either a Pass/NR grade scale in place of WPI’s usual A/B/C/NR scale.

Individual students may have special situations or constraints that would guide their choice in this matter.</p>\n<p>This is a statement of support for all WPI undergraduate students from your WPI faculty who, as always, are invested in your success as well as concerned about your well-being in very trying times.

I’m so proud of each of you for doing your part to make this not only possible, but successful. And special thanks to those with designated emergency personnel status who are still working on the physical campus in these stressful times. Our transition has been largely smooth, with only a few bumps along the way, as we all adjust to balancing the needs of our families with learning and working in new ways. That success is entirely because of the commitment of this community. Thank you.</p>\n<p>These are certainly unprecedented times—and WPI’s student-centered, problem-solving DNA is more evident now than ever before. We have moved online with true WPI intensity—in just the first three days of D-Term, we held over 2,600 Zoom meetings totaling 1.1 million minutes!</p>\n<p>While I know that on occasion our home technology has presented challenges, I am pleased to report that the campus systems are holding up very well. Thanks to everyone—from faculty, to IT, to all our student support teams—for your contributions to getting us to this point.</p>\n<p>On to the business at hand … I want to provide a few updates:</p>\n<p>In line with state and federal guidelines, our current remote working directive will remain in place until further notice. Eventually we will all be able to return to our beautiful campus, and the CERT is working on plans for doing so when the time is right. When that time comes, we will be sure to provide ample notice of the transition so that you can make any necessary plans or preparations. For now, please continue work from where you are.</p>\n<p>With the COVID-19 situation still active and unpredictable, we have made the responsible but very difficult decision to postpone Commencement to a future date still to be determined. Over the next two weeks we will gather feedback from graduating students and, based on their input, we will make new plans to honor our graduates. For those who can join, we will hold an in-person Commencement ceremony for the Great Class of 2020 when it is safe to do so. Once we have consulted with our students, we will share more details on our plans.</p>\n<p>Since it is so important that we maintain our connection to each other during these unprecedented times, we will host our second virtual Town Hall on Wednesday, April 8, at 3pm, via Zoom and streaming on YouTube. The last Town Hall had nearly 700 participants across both platforms, and I hope you will join us again as we share updates and answer your questions. We will send a reminder as the date approaches, but if you’d like to mark your calendar now, here are the links to both Zoom (which will again have the Q&#x26;A feature) and to YouTube:</p>\n<p>Please continue to check our Coronavirus website for the latest updates and FAQs.

We surely are living in unprecedented times, and I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge the uncertainty that many of us are facing due to the rapid pace of change occurring not only at W&#x26;M, but also in our local communities, nationally, and globally. Now more than ever, I trust that our powerful sense of community will help sustain us, even as we adapt to new ways of connecting, learning, and affirming belonging.​</p>\n<p>​As the week begins here in Williamsburg, our top priority is supporting students as on-line learning commences and as we prepare for the closing of Residence Halls on Wednesday. Some of you have sought to understand better our decision not to keep any dorms open, especially for international students. We continue to be guided first and foremost by the advice of our local health authorities. Indeed, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our community. Given the growing number of Covid-19 cases in our surrounding area, including in our campus community, we recognized that our residence halls are unsuitable for long term self-quarantine and self-isolation, which will be necessary in the weeks ahead; additionally, we are not staffed to provide a high level of health care and living support for students under pandemic conditions.​</p>\n<p>​Students who are having difficulty implementing their personal evacuation plans under these unprecedented circumstances, will be helped on an individual basis, and we will deploy emergency funds wherever possible to ease the financial burden as students await housing, dining, and parking rebates (detailed information about rebates will be sent soon in a separate message). A compilation of resources was created and shared last week with all students who had alerted us to their urgent need; the Dean of Students and Reves Center teams are following up with those students by phone today to determine what needs have yet to be met. All students who alerted us should be contacted by the end of the day. Many of you have reached out and expressed compassion and concern for your fellow students who may be in need -- please be assured that no student will be without shelter when the residence halls close on March 25. If you, yourself, are a dorm resident who is having difficulty with your plan for moving out by Wednesday and you have not notified the Dean of Students Office, please do so right away by clicking here. ​</p>\n<p>​It is my sincere hope that each of you will tap into tools and resources that you have found work best for you during trying times. Below are some additional resources that you may find helpful as you transition to our new online educational environment:​</p>\n<p>From Health &#x26; Wellness​</p>\n<p>​The departments of Health &#x26; Wellness have created a Virtual Health &#x26; Wellness site. We have posted programs, videos and articles to enhance your wellness and resilience, including live wellness and fitness programs. Last week over 160 people join our first live, remote yoga class! Our live programs will be recorded to be used at your convenience. Be sure to visit our Virtual Health &#x26; Wellness site where you will find an article by Dr. Kelly Crace on Flourishing during Unexpected, Uncertain, and Unwanted Change. And please download the W&#x26;M Wellness App to stay current on all events and resources.​</p>\n<p>From the Dean of Students Office​</p>\n<p>While William &#x26; Mary is operating on a modified academic schedule, all the departments of the Dean of Students Office are available via phone (757) 221-2510 and email. Additionally, we will have the capability of scheduling meetings with students remotely via phone or Zoom. We want to support your success as we transition online. If you need assistance, please do not hesitate to visit our website for a full listing of our departments to help in your success.​</p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<p>In the days and weeks ahead, stay connected with us and with one another. We will continue to reach out to you with updates and information we think you may find useful. Best wishes as W&#x26;M moves forward into this new virtual educational environment. Remember that we are in this together -- all W&#x26;M offices are \"open\" and we are here for you.​</p>\n<p>Yours,​</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler​</p>\n<p>​Virginia M. Ambler, PhD​</p>\n<p>Vice President for Student Affairs​</p>\n<p>William &#x26; Mary</p>\n<p>Back to the top</p>\n<p>Update for Students from Vice President Ambler</p>\n<p>March 16, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Students,</p>\n<p>Below I share the additional details and guidance promised earlier today in the message you received from President Rowe and me related to directives from the Governor’s Office. As previously noted, we strongly advise all students to physically leave campus if they can. During the period of time where the university and its campuses are not open to the public, we will continue to provide essential services as best we can.</p>\n<p>Please keep the following in mind:</p>\n<p>All Students</p>\n<p>Questions About COVID-19 Response. The best source for updated information regarding the university’s response to COVID-19 remains the online Q&#x26;A by the university at www.wm.edu/coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you have questions directly related to the impact of COVID-19 in the Williamsburg/Peninsula area, state and local health authorities have set up two Call Centers:</p>\n<p>The Peninsula Health Department call center at 757-594-7069</p>\n<p>The Southside Health Department call center at 757-683-2745</p>\n<p>Pass/Fail Expansion. As we prepare to change our instructional delivery modes starting next week, we are expanding the pass-fail option for Spring 2020. Degree-seeking academic juniors and seniors may elect Pass/Fail grading for up to two normally-graded courses; academic freshmen and sophomores may elect to take one normally-graded course on a Pass/Fail basis this semester. If you intend to select Pass/Fail, you must do so in Banner during the extended withdrawal period, which now ends on Monday March 30 at 11:59 pm. See the student FAQ section at www.wm.edu/coronavirus for additional details.</p>\n<p>Room Selection. At this time room selection for returning students for the 2020-2021 Academic Year will proceed on schedule online, including Priority Housing.</p>\n<p>If you have direct questions for Residence Life, all communications have been sent to student W&#x26;M emails and shared via our Residence Life website. Please know that although the Residence Life office is closed to the general public they will still be responding to emails sent to living@wm.edu. However, please expect delays in responses due to high volume.</p>\n<p>Wellness Resources for You. Our Health &#x26; Wellness team is working to create a Virtual Wellness Center that includes a variety of wellness and fitness resources for students to access online. From exercise, personal training, and yoga videos to mindfulness and creative art, we will be offering a wide range of resources to help you manage the stress and emotions that are a part of this new challenge. For those who want to use this time to deepen their learning on various wellness areas, we will be providing educational resources on a wide range of topics, including managing cabin fever. Give us a couple more days to complete and compile our videos and then check in frequently on our main website, www.wm.edu/offices/wellness, or download our new W&#x26;M Wellness App! Simply browse our wellness departments' resource pages or our App and dive into something that speaks to you. For instance, this may be a great time to learn about our online training modules on mental health via SilverCloud (<a href=\"https://www.wm.edu/offices/wellness/ohp/general-wellness/silvercloud/\">https://www.wm.edu/offices/wellness/ohp/general-wellness/silvercloud/</a>).</p>\n<p>Students Away from Campus</p>\n<p>Access to personal items. In accordance with the governor’s directive, access to residence halls for pick-up of personal items left over spring break is temporarily suspended while the campus and campus offices are closed to the public. Faculty will be flexible about academic materials (textbooks and the like) that you do not have access to. Barnes &#x26; Noble, through VitalSource, has made arrangements for students to have free access to eTextbooks. Here are two web resources that provide additional information:</p>\n<p>Connecting remotely to campus IT resources. We are working to identify and support any students who might have equipment, connectivity or other assistance needs in accessing online instruction. Please contact the Dean of Students Office for assistance. Additionally, if you do not have WiFi connectivity or access to the internet and currently have a cellular phone, you may want to contact your carrier to determine if your phone has the ability to serve as a mobile hotspot.</p>\n<p>IT has set up the web resource that may also be helpful, <a href=\"https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/remoteresources/index.php\">https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/remoteresources/index.php</a>.</p>\n<p>Students Remaining on Campus Due to Extenuating Circumstances</p>\n<p>Group Gatherings. We are asking residents who remain on campus due to extenuating circumstances not to gather in groups. Medical advice at this time is that interaction is limited to immediate circle groups only. In our residential setting, we interpret this as roommate/suitemate groups. Do not gather socially in larger groups in your residence halls, across campus or in locations in the community. Remaining on campus and utilizing university resources while practicing social distancing - remaining 6 to 8 feet from other individuals is preferred.</p>\n<p>Building Access. Carry your keys and ID with you every time you leave the room. Residence Life staff will be unable to respond to lockout requests. You are responsible for locking your doors and carrying your keys. In an emergency situation, WMPD will help with a lockout, but we need this to be a last resort.</p>\n<p>Building Hours. Please note new hours for the Post Office in Sadler and the Student Health Center:</p>\n<p>The Post Office will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and is accessible from the west door of the Sadler Center.</p>\n<p>The Student Health Center remains open to students by appointment only. Students should call ahead to schedule an appointment.</p>\n<p>Dining Services. Commons is set up as a to-go option only and no self-service. Food is either pre-packaged or boxed by dining staff and is available 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Tribe Market is open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Chick-fil-A is to-go only, no indoor seating.</p>\n<p>Duty Office Hours. Duty Offices in Residence Halls will remain closed at this time.</p>\n<p>Emergencies. Emergencies need to be directed to the W&#x26;M Police at 757-221-4596.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and support as we move through these challenging days together.</p>\n<p>Yours,</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler</p>\n<p>Back to the top</p>","id":"7d19df3e-20be-514b-bd6c-746a97c03b35","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-wm/2020-04-08-23_27_06/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID messages to students"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.wm.edu/images/social/default.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Sam Jones, chair of W&#x26;M's emergency management team and Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs sent the following messages to the campus community regarding COVID-19. - Ed.</p>\n<p>Jan. 25 | Informational Health Advisory</p>\n<p>April 8, 2020 Dear faculty and staff, The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated many changes in a short period of time in both our work and personal lives.

The central source of all of this information remains our COVID-19 website. Here are some updates and reminders regarding current university operations. Summer sessions and research. Both summer sessions are planned for remote delivery. The Provost sent detailed guidance about these and other summer programs to the campus community yesterday, April 7. Additional guidance for students, including information about final move-out, will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>Both summer sessions are planned for remote delivery.

Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>Back to the top COVID-19 Update XVIII: Governor's \"stay-at-home\" order March 30, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam issued a statewide “stay-at-home” order this afternoon. This order reinforces the guidelines on social distancing and restriction on congregating in groups of ten or more people he previously recommended. The new order does not impact our current operations. The directive is based on the advice of national and state health officials and continues to mean that all employees who can telework should do so. Faculty who must be on campus to conduct a lecture, should maintain a dedicated footprint (enter by the same door, visit the same office, use the same restroom) while in a university facility and then leave campus as soon as possible. Essential personnel should continue to be in contact with their supervisors. While the COVID-19 outbreak is far from over, either in our region or nationwide, we are at a pivot point operationally on campus. Moving forward, in addition to communication from the Emergency Management Team you will also receive communications directly from departments and units. The university’s COVID-19 website will remain a central source of information. We encourage you to refer to it often. This site was redesigned last week, we hope you find that helpful. If you have a question that is not addressed in the FAQs, you may continue to submit them at the bottom of that page. Stay well and safe. Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>COVID-19 Update XVII: Office remain closed to public walk-in traffic, other updates March 20, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community, Last weekend we announced that university offices would be temporarily closed to the public for walk-in access. Given the advice of federal, state and local health officials, we are extending that restriction through at least May 1. University offices remain operational and all employees who can work remotely should plan to telework through at least the end of the semester. This measure is part of a coordinated effort to support social distancing and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our area. Employees should not be on campus just because they prefer to work from their W&#x26;M office. Additionally, any member of this community who has been asked by public health officials to self-quarantine or self-isolate must follow those directives and should not be on campus. Please understand that these steps are being taken with the health and wellness of our entire community in mind. Everyone’s cooperation is greatly appreciated. Essential employees should continue to be in touch with their supervisors for their assignments. There has been a lot of information on a variety of topics this week. Our COVID-19 web hub, www.wm.edu/coronavirus, is the best central source for all information related to the university’s COVID-19 response. Highlighted below are a couple of items announced this week: Residence halls will close for the remainder of the spring semester for all students on Wednesday, March 25. Details related to this closure are available on the Residence Life website. Any residential student, including graduate and international students, with an issue or concern related to this should contact the Dean of Students Office at deanofstudents@wm.edu. We want to emphasize that in these difficult times, we remain committed to our William &#x26; Mary values of belonging and respect. This office is assisting students, international and domestic, in identifying viable options for accommodation based upon their individual situations, and they are in touch with those students.</p>\n<p>In addition to university offices being closed to the public, university buildings are in a “locked, but not closed” status. Under this status, employees are reminded they need their card key or manual key to enter buildings. Students who are still on campus have access to their residence hall (until March 25) and the Commons.</p>\n<p>And a couple of academic updates: Pass/Fail . The Provost’s Office has announced that Pass/Fail grading will be available for undergraduate courses through the end of the semester. Additional details are available on the University Registrar’s No Decision on Commencement . As President Rowe announced in her March 19 message to the W&#x26;M community, any decision on Commencement has been postponed until April. Summer Study Abroad . In light of COVID-19 developments around the world, including the US Department of State Global Level 4 Health Advisory – Do Not Travel as well as increasing travel restrictions in many countries, W&#x26;M has made the decision to cancel all summer study abroad programs. Students and faculty directly affected by these cancellations have been notified, and we are working to help support students as they adjust their academic plans. Remote Teaching &#x26; Learning . All in-person classes will be taught remotely beginning Monday, March 23 and continuing through the end of the semester. Resources are available online to faculty, staff and students for both connecting remotely to university resources and faculty for remote teaching and learning strategies.</p>\n<p>Also, we’d liked to remind each of you to take care of yourself. We have all experienced a lot of change in recent weeks and we need to take care of both our physical health and mental health. To aid in this, the McLeod Tyler Wellness Center has transitioned its in-house services to online delivery. We understand they had 160 members of our community “at” a yoga class this week. See the options at www.wm.edu/wellness/virtual. On that site is a special article on flourishing during unexpected change. We hope it will be a valuable resource for this community as we explore how to healthfully manage the wide range of emotions and thoughts associated with this challenging time. In true W&#x26;M fashion, look out for yourself and one another. Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>COVID-19 update XVI -- W&#x26;M Building access March 18, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary Community, In accordance with local and federal guidance, William &#x26; Mary continues to take steps to protect the campus community and do our best to slow the spread of COVID-19. With that in mind, effective this morning, William &#x26; Mary is instituting a “locked, but not closed” policy for all W&#x26;M buildings, including VIMS. This means W&#x26;M buildings will be locked and only accessible by electronic or manual key to faculty, staff and students who require entry. The university is also asking our community members to always lock doors behind them when entering a facility. If you require entry, but do not have a key, please contact W&#x26;M Police at 757-221-4596. William &#x26; Mary closed all offices to the public on March 16, and advised employees to work remotely wherever possible. Students have been strongly urged to physically leave campus if they can; only limited services are available and access may be restricted further in the coming days. The W&#x26;M Post Office is currently open with limited access from 8 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday through Friday. The post office can be accessed through the sliding doors next to the Sadler Center loading dock. Community members whose buildings are locked can call 757-221-4491 to make arrangements for pick-up or delivery. University leadership continues to work diligently on this situation and we will provide updates as we know more. Please continue to reference www.wm.edu/coronavirus as the best source for all W&#x26;M-related information, including answers to frequently-asked questions, on COVID-19.

To that end, we wanted to make you aware that we learned today that a resident in Old Dominion Hall showed symptoms consistent with those of COVID-19 and is being tested. There is not a confirmed case.The university is in contact with the Virginia Department of Health and we are following all recommendations. You may have heard or seen that we had crews cleaning in that building. We did this out of an abundance of caution.The individual will remain under self-quarantine at another location and the university is currently providing support, including meals and healthcare. In accordance with privacy laws and our own policy, we will not be releasing detailed information in order to protect their privacy. William &#x26; Mary is a close-knit community and we know this message will generate both empathy and concern, especially for those who live nearby. Unless you are contacted directly by local or state health officials, you do not need to do anything specific as a result of this news. Please know we are doing all we can to not only support this member of our community but also protect the health and wellness of our entire community. If you have questions specifically related to area impact of COVID-19, the Virginia Department of Health has opened a call center at 757-594-7069. Please check the Peninsula &#x26; Hampton Health District Facebook page for hours of operation. We announced earlier this week that all William &#x26; Mary campus offices would be closed to the public until at least March 23 as part of a coordinated statewide effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. Additionally this week, Gov. Ralph Northam also announced the state was banning gatherings of 10 or more people. The university remains operational and just those students with extenuating circumstances remain on campus with limited services.Given the rapidly changing nature of this situation, we encourage any of those students still on campus to leave if you can. If you cannot leave, we encourage you to be ready with your personal emergency evacuation plan should it become necessary for us to close residence halls. If you have questions, you may contact residence life at living@wm.edu. As a reminder, the www.wm.edu/coronavirus website is the most up-to-date source about William &#x26; Mary’s response.

Ralph Northam has issued a directive closing executive branch and state facility offices in the Peninsula Health District, which includes William &#x26; Mary. In support of this directive, the university is closing all offices to the general public, effective noon today, for one week through March 22. This includes all W&#x26;M campuses, including VIMS. Classes remain on schedule to resume via online and distance platforms on Monday, March 23. Online classes currently underway will continue uninterrupted. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience as we navigate this rapidly changing situation. Please review the following guidance related to today’s announcement: Telework Employees should contact their supervisors and plan to work remotely if at all possible. Advance approval is not required for telework. Essential personnel should report as normal, unless advised otherwise by their supervisors. Other personnel may need to report as requested by their supervisors. Emergency Leave According to the governor’s directive, hourly wage employees, including adjunct faculty, who are unable to telework may use Public Health Emergency Leave provided by the state. The employees will be paid based on the hours they are normally scheduled to work each week. HR will provide additional details to eligible employees. Limited Campus Services We strongly advise all students to physically leave campus if they can. While William &#x26; Mary is not open to the public, the university will continue to provide essential services to students who remain on campus due to extenuating circumstances. We will provide students with additional information today on modified dining operations. Resources and Training IT developed a resource page of tools to assist with employees’ telework. Additionally, employees who need to take university desktops or laptops home to facilitate their work may do so for the duration of their telework arrangement. Supervisors received an email last week from HR regarding two virtual training sessions this week on supervising teleworking employees. One is scheduled for today and the other is planned for March 19. Please plan to participate in one of these sessions. Supervisors who have urgent questions on matters related to telework and alternate work arrangements, please e-mail hrguy@wm.edu. Employees with questions should contact their supervisors. University leadership continues to work diligently on this situation and we will provide updates as we know more. Please continue to reference www.wm.edu/coronavirus as the best source for all W&#x26;M-related information on COVID-19. Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>COVID-19 Important Update XIII: Confirmed Case March 14, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community, The university received confirmation today that a staff member has tested positive for COVID-19. As of this notification, this is the first and only case of COVID-19 involving a member of the W&#x26;M community. That is very likely to change in the near future as more cases are diagnosed in the surrounding Williamsburg area. In accordance with privacy laws and our own policy, we will not be releasing detailed information about this positive case or any subsequent cases. The Virginia Department of Health is in the process of contacting people who may have been in close contact with this individual. If you have received a call from VDH regarding self-quarantine, please follow their instructions. If you have not received a call, you do not need to take specific action related to this case but please continue practicing good preventative hygiene measures and limit close interaction with others as much as practically possible. We are in contact with VDH and are closely following their recommendations. Please remember that amidst this serious pandemic, the vast majority of affected individuals will develop only mild to moderate symptoms. Preparation, not panic, will provide the best assurance that the health of our community is protected. The campus remains open and operating under the interim policies announced March 11. William &#x26; Mary is a close-knit community and we know this message will generate both empathy and concern. Please know we are doing all we can to provide this member of our community support and protect the health and wellness of our community.

Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>Back to the top Update XII: COVID-19 - Operational Details March 13, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – William &#x26; Mary leadership continues to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak and develop the university’s response. We want to provide you additional details on the interim policies President Rowe announced in her March 11 message. Information and links are below and please remember that www.wm.edu/coronavirus is the best source for all W&#x26;M-related information. Thank you to all members of the community who continue to reach out and contact us via the website question box and the Call Center. Your feedback and information is very helpful in our planning and communications. Yesterday, we posted detailed frequently asked questions for faculty, staff and students. We are also reopening the Call Center this afternoon until 5 p.m. That number is 757-221-1565. Here are some important updates and reminders: Working Remotely. Over the coming weeks the university will continue normal administrative operations, albeit with some adjustments. These adjustments — in relative order of priority — include a) utilizing telework if appropriate b) practicing social distancing in work spaces, c) using flexible scheduling of staff and d) developing creative solutions. The health and safety of our employees is a priority and following CDC guidelines for social distancing and hygiene are the first and best courses for action. If an employee does not already have a current telework agreement, they should start the approval process by speaking with his/her supervisor. Supervisors will be flexible in allowing employees who have appropriate work and are able to work remotely to do so. Ultimately, approval by the unit vice president, vice provost, dean or their designee(s) is required to telework during the COVID-19 emergency. That approval will be obtained by the supervisor. Not all requests to telework can be approved due to the nature of the job. HR will be providing training sessions for supervisors on telework principles and policies March 16 and 19. Contact HR for details. Emergency Leave. With Governor Northam’s declaration of a state of emergency, university employees have access to Emergency Health Leave. This leave is available to both salaried and hourly employees and may be used for an employee’s own illness or to take care of an immediate family member. The leave is for illness or care directly related to COVID-19 and is to be used prior to any existing leave an employee may already have. Please contact HR if you have questions regarding eligibility. Residence Hall Access. Yesterday, Residence Life provided detailed information regarding residence hall access and student services. Swem Library has modified operating hours on its website and a list of building access times is available on the university’s COVID-19 website. Grading Guidance. The deadline for faculty to enter midterm grades for undergraduate courses has been extended to Sunday, March 29. Additionally, the deadline for undergraduate, graduate A&#x26;S and marine science students to withdraw for a grade of “W” from full-semester classes has been extended to Monday, March 30. Online instruction. As a reminder, the university has prepared this website to support the online instructional, remote learning and technology needs of faculty, students and staff as we transition to remote and online platforms.

Back to the top Update VIII: COVID-19 - Spring Break March 6, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community - Spring break is here. Please enjoy a safe, healthy and relaxing time. Many of you have had questions regarding campus events. At this time, the only changes announced by the university involve study abroad and university-sponsored international travel. Anyone taking a personal trip over the break is reminded to follow CDC guidelines regarding restricted travel locations and, in the case of international travel, protocols and requirements for reentry into the United States. Links to those resources are available at www.wm.edu/coronavirus. This website remains the best source for information and updates related to our campus community and COVID-19. Also included on that site are FAQs regarding actions the university has taken and preparations related to COVID-19. There is also a comment box should you have a question that isn’t already addressed in the FAQs. Feedback and questions received via our online form will help inform future campus messages and information we include on the website. Over the break, please pay extra attention to the recommendations of health officials for the prevention of catching and spreading COVID-19, especially washing your hands regularly with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face and following CDC guidelines for quarantine or self-isolation if you have traveled. Upon your return, we expect the university to be operating under a normal class schedule. The Emergency Management Team will continue to monitor this situation and inform you of any updates. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update VII: COVID-19 - Spring Break &#x26; Ongoing Communications March 4, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – As you prepare for spring break and potentially leaving campus, please pay close attention to recommendations and guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Virginia Department of Health. The status of COVID-19 is changing rapidly both the United States and a number of countries overseas. Domestically, Covid-19 is now reported in 13 states and more than 75 other countries worldwide. If you are planning personal travel abroad over the break, please be advised that travel warning and restrictions are very fluid. Leaving the country at this time includes the risk of potentially not being able to leave the country you visit and/or delays or quarantines in returning to the United States. Anyone who is not a U.S. citizen should be especially aware of the possibility of U.S. government restriction on reentry. State Department and CDC websites are the best sources of the most up-to-date- information related to overseas travel. All official information on COVID-19 and the university’s response to it will continue to come from the W&#x26;M Emergency Management Team (Sam Jones in your Inbox). The information we share is important and we ask that you review each of these messages carefully. The Reves Center, and its Global Education website, are the information source for those who are currently studying abroad, or plan to do so in the summer or fall. Please contact the Reves Center as you have questions. The university will continue to update the website <a href=\"https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus</a> on a daily basis so it remains a primary source for the most up-to-date information. Once you return to William &#x26; Mary, our focus will continue to be on prevention. All the standard rules apply. Wash your hands frequently and long enough to make a difference. Do not share water bottles, etc. If you are sick, go to the doctor. If you are sick, do not go to class, and faculty and staff should not come to work. Cough into you sleeve, or into a tissue which should be immediately discarded. Wipe down work and study spaces with a disinfectant. While these actions may seem basic, they are fundamental to preventing the spread of Covid-19 as well as other diseases. This video from Student Health Center Director Dr. David Dafashy is a good reminder of general COVID-19 information and prevention tips. Have an enjoyable and safe spring break. We look forwarding to seeing you back on campus and expect to be operating under a normal schedule for both classes and events. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update VI: COVID-19 - New Travel Restrictions March 2, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – You have likely heard that travel warnings to both Italy and Iran were elevated over the weekend due to COVID-19 outbreaks. Given these additional warnings, all university-sponsored undergraduate student travel is now currently prohibited to Italy, China and South Korea and all other countries on our restricted destinations list. This new prohibition means that undergraduate students may not remain in Italy on university-sponsored travel at this time. The university’s Global Education Office is working individually with any of our students impacted by this. No decisions have been made yet regarding summer study abroad. The university is currently assessing the viability of specific summer programs and will be in contact soon with applicants.

You have contributed new ideas and solutions for local, national, and global challenges. You have made personal discoveries, performed countless hours of service to help others, and persevered through trials big and small. When we began this semester, you and I fully expected to gather with your loved ones, professors, and friends in May to celebrate all that you have achieved.</p>\n<p>I know you have been following the news around the world closely. To continue to do our part to end the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot come together in May to commemorate commencement activities in the traditional ways. However, know that we will be welcoming you back to campus to celebrate your achievements when this crisis is behind us. In the meantime, we will find alternative ways to honor your hard work this May. Secretary and Vice President for University Life Kimberly Goff-Crews will write to you in the coming days to share more planning details.</p>\n<p>We have an obligation that extends well beyond our campus community. However, even though we know this is what we must do, this news is no less disappointing. The expectations we had for spring have unraveled, but recent events remind us of the ways we are connected and that there come extraordinary times when we are impelled to take care of one another in a basic and profound way. The pandemic calls on each of us to think beyond our own expectations—and to look forward to brighter days to come, together. Thank you for your understanding and for all you are doing to fulfill our responsibilities to the common good.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Peter Salovey</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology</p>","id":"0de3b62d-3a2b-5a10-9bc2-1eb56c14dc33","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-yale/2020-04-08-23_39_37/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 Update - Commencement Changes"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://covid19.yale.edu/misc/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>March 14, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Yale Community,</p>\n<p>I write to inform you of important decisions regarding the remainder of the spring semester and remind you of measures we must take in the interest of the health and safety of our community.</p>\n<p>First Yale COVID-19 Case</p>\n<p>Earlier today, Director of Yale Health Paul Genecin notified us that a member of our community has tested positive for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) on a preliminary test, and that we await confirmation of this result. Another community member and a household contact are also undergoing diagnostic evaluation, and we await test results for these individuals. All three are under the care of physicians and nurses at Yale New Haven Hospital. I join all of you in the wish that they make a complete and speedy recovery from their illnesses. They are very much on my mind.</p>\n<p>We are working to trace these individuals’ recent interactions with other people and communicate with them. We will—as Dr. Genecin writes—provide guidance as soon as possible to those who have had close contact with these members of our community.</p>\n<p>Online Classes, and Students Remain Off Campus, for Balance of Semester</p>\n<p>As this news highlights, the increasing intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic has required that we revisit decisions that seemed proactive when first announced just days before. On March 10, I let you know that through at least April 5, we would ask Yale College students to remain at home after recess and graduate students to remain off campus as much as possible, and that we would hold classes online using Zoom, Canvas, and other digital tools. It was my hope then that we might see a return to normalcy before the end of the semester.</p>\n<p>With regret, and in consultation with Yale’s medical and public-health experts and other university leaders, I have concluded that an early return to the classroom is not possible. The clearest relevant lesson we have drawn from our best-informed, wisest sources is this: pandemics are defeated by bold measures that blunt the curve of the rate of infection through the dramatic reduction of intense human contact.</p>\n<p>I have therefore decided that the measures we announced on March 10—keeping students off campus and moving teaching online—will apply through the full spring semester, including final examinations.</p>\n<p>I hasten to note one vital exception: Yale will house those students who simply cannot go home, whether because they come from a country severely affected by COVID-19, or for other serious reasons. Deans and others have been or will be in close touch with such students—they and a great number of others are working around the clock to offer support worthy of Yale.</p>\n<p>A special request to Yale College students: please refrain from coming back to campus right now to retrieve your belongings. Dean Marvin Chun and his staff will be in touch with you soon about making necessary arrangements.</p>\n<p>I realize that today’s decision may be distressing to some. I am thinking in particular of those students who are finishing their time at Yale this semester. For them, the present anxiety is compounded by sadness over the loss of what should have been a warm, celebratory final semester. Please know that I share your disappointment. But also know that I, with other Yale leaders, will be thinking of ways we can, once COVID-19 is behind us, bring you back to campus to celebrate. It is too soon to say whether Commencement Weekend, scheduled for mid-May, will be carried out in the traditional way. But one way or another, we will come together in due time.</p>\n<p>Staffing Considerations: New Guidance Through March 31</p>\n<p>Yale is pivoting to serve, through the end of the semester, as a university providing online education to our students while keeping some research and other vital functions up and running.</p>\n<p>On March 11, Vice President for Human Resources Janet Lindner informed all Yale staff of social-distancing measures to be implemented through April 15. Those measures remain in place. But given the increasing seriousness of the threat posed by COVID-19, we are taking a further step to decrease the number of people on campus and minimize contact among those who are here.</p>\n<p>Effective Monday, March 16 through Tuesday, March 31, only staff whose work is deemed critical to current operations will be expected to report to work on campus. Staff not required to report to campus will be expected to support the continuity of operations of the university by working remotely if possible.</p>\n<p>Critical functions include, but are not limited to, the following: patient care; research; network and data centers; public safety; student care; and select academic, administrative, and operational functions including, at present, those integral to the transition to online learning. Deans or their designates and department leaders will provide further information to their staffs indicating the units and individuals deemed critical through March 31.</p>\n<p>Department leaders will inform staff members if they must report to campus. Those who are unsure if they should report to campus should reach out to their managers directly.</p>\n<p>The university will provide further information on financial recognition to staff performing critical functions who are required to report to campus. Bargaining-unit members required to report to campus will be compensated according to union contract provisions related to critical functions.</p>\n<p>Staff reporting to work on campus should practice social distancing by not congregating in groups, maintaining barriers between work stations, and keeping approximately six feet of distance from others whenever possible.</p>\n<p>We will continue to assess the situation each day, and before the end of March will announce policies affecting staff for April and beyond. If you are a member of the Yale staff and have questions, contact your manager, lead administrator, human resources generalist, or the Employee Service Center (203-432-5552).</p>\n<p>In closing</p>\n<p>Other Yale leaders and I will communicate frequently with you in the coming days and weeks. I remind you that Yale’s COVID-19 website remains our hub for news and guidance. Please consult this website for updates.</p>\n<p>As we work through this time together, I ask you to take care of yourselves and each other—and to let Yale help you do that. Please continue to take precautions, self-monitor, and treat one another with great kindness and sensitivity. I will continue to stay in close touch with you.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Peter Salovey</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology</p>","id":"8e0c6c0f-4eeb-510a-93f8-1d8e136898be","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-yale/2020-04-08-23_39_40/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 Update – First Confirmed Yale COVID-19 Case; Extending Online Instruction to End of Spring Semester; Campus and Staffing Considerations"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://covid19.yale.edu/misc/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>March 10, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Yale Community,</p>\n<p>I write with significant updates to Yale’s response to the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, we have all seen that the challenges posed by COVID-19 are rapidly changing across our country and the world. I ask you to join me in taking new actions to prevent and slow the spread of the virus. Current scientific and medical evidence suggests that preemptive public health measures are more effective than those that are reactive. By being proactive as a community, we can safeguard our own health and the well-being of those with whom we interact.</p>\n<p>In this message, I describe actions that will minimize close-proximity interaction among members of our community in classrooms, dining halls, residential colleges, and other common facilities:</p>\n<p>Moving classes online when they resume after spring recess</p>\n<p>Asking students to remain home or return home when possible</p>\n<p>Limiting international and domestic travel</p>\n<p>Maintaining continuity of research and teaching</p>\n<p>Ensuring ongoing staff operations and well-being</p>\n<p>Restricting the size of events</p>\n<p>This plan is based on the expert advice of dedicated faculty and medical professionals at the Yale Schools of Public Health, Medicine, and Nursing; Yale Health; and local, state, and federal agencies. By taking these preventive measures, we protect those who are most vulnerable to this disease.</p>\n<p>For advice on what to do if you become ill, and other important information, please visit Yale’s COVID-19 website.</p>\n<p>Moving classes online when they resume after spring recess</p>\n<p>When spring recess ends and through April 5 at the earliest, classes will be held using Zoom, Canvas, or other online tools. I know classes take many forms across the university, so this shift to online teaching and learning raises many questions. Deans will be communicating with their faculty and students to provide further details in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>All faculty members and graduate student teaching assistants received information from the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning describing how to convert their courses to online instruction and to obtain assistance with the transition. Please reach out to the Poorvu center as soon as possible if you need support (askpoorvucenter@yale.edu).</p>\n<p>As we approach April 5, we will reassess the situation and communicate next steps. We will provide information sufficiently in advance of that date to allow for planning.</p>\n<p>Asking students to remain home or return home when possible</p>\n<p>We are asking Yale College students to remain at home after spring recess. For undergraduates who are on campus now, please make every effort to return home as soon as possible, and no later than Sunday, March 15. Yale College Dean Marvin Chun will be providing additional details in the coming days. Undergraduates will have the support of the university in meeting their academic requirements remotely while at home. I understand that some undergraduates consider New Haven to be their home or cannot leave the university at this time. The Yale College Dean’s Office will provide separate instructions for these students, who also will take their classes online.</p>\n<p>Graduate and professional students are encouraged to remain off-campus and participate in online instruction, unless being on campus is necessitated by the nature of their research or academic programs. More information is forthcoming from the deans of each school.</p>\n<p>The university will remain open and continue to provide custodial and limited dining services.</p>\n<p>Limiting international and domestic travel</p>\n<p>The following is an update and elaboration on previously announced travel policies. Please note that this guidance pertains to faculty, staff, and graduate and professional students. We urge Yale College students presently on campus to return home if possible.</p>\n<p>University-sponsored travel (Travel is considered university-sponsored if it draws on a university-administered funding source.) All university-sponsored international travel is now prohibited. We strongly urge you to postpone university-sponsored domestic travel and find ways to conduct the work online.</p>\n<p>Personal travel For personal international travel, we urge you to carefully reconsider your travel choices and avoid traveling if possible. For personal domestic travel, please consider your decisions carefully and avoid traveling if your agenda includes participation in conferences or other large gatherings.</p>\n<p>If you must travel, review the table that summarizes Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) travel notices and Yale Health guidance. Most importantly, if you are traveling to any country or region on the CDC Warning Level 3 list, complete this registration form and self-monitor and self-isolate for 14 days after you return using these guidelines.</p>\n<p>Maintaining continuity of research and teaching</p>\n<p>While the health of Yale’s faculty, staff, and students is our top priority, the university also remains committed to its mission of research and education. Faculty members and graduate and professional students are asked to carry out their teaching responsibilities online. Research groups have been asked to make contingency plans to maintain research continuity, which may involve faculty, staff, and students continuing to work and study in labs, machine shops, offices, and other campus facilities. The university will maintain central services to support research and teaching.</p>\n<p>Ensuring ongoing staff operations and well-being</p>\n<p>By separate email this week, staff will be provided with information about measures the university is taking to plan for the continuation of university operations and to ensure everyone’s continued safety. Most generally, we encourage staff to hold meetings virtually, and we ask each staff leader to provide flexibility for people to work from home when consistent with their job responsibilities and to have time to care for any ill family members, should the need arise.</p>\n<p>Restricting the size of events</p>\n<p>On March 7, the university asked students, faculty, and staff to postpone, cancel, or adjust all Yale-hosted events, other than classes, expected to involve 100 or more participants. Yale’s COVID-19 website provides additional information about Yale’s libraries and museums. As noted in the original announcement, even if an event has fewer than 100 people, please think about moving your event online or increasing the size of the venue so that participants can be spread apart.</p>\n<p>We will continue to monitor carefully the spread of COVID-19. It may prove necessary to extend the actions described here beyond their end date or to take additional measures to safeguard everyone’s health based on emerging medical and scientific information. We will keep you informed of updates by email and will maintain the latest news and guidance on Yale’s COVID-19 website.</p>\n<p>I appreciate the students, faculty, and staff members who have worked so hard in recent weeks to promote the health of members of our community and to contribute to the well-being of those who live and work beyond our campus. In the coming weeks, we will need to rely on one another’s resilience, patience, and expertise more than ever before. Please accept my gratitude for your efforts to protect each other’s health and support the continuity of the university’s mission.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Peter Salovey</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology</p>","id":"f21615fd-6170-5821-9a17-740fd9c85547","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-yale/2020-04-08-23_39_46/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 – Moving courses online and other significant updates"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://covid19.yale.edu/misc/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>April 3, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Yale Community,</p>\n<p>We are heartened to see the Yale community’s unified response to the challenges posed by COVID-19. We thank you for your adherence to the guidance that has been provided.</p>\n<p>As we continue to focus on ensuring the health and safety of all members of the community amid uncertainty about the trajectory of the pandemic, Yale is implementing the following changes for all university-sponsored summer travel and campus-based programs:</p>\n<p>In-person summer programs at Yale cancelled through June 27</p>\n<p>All in-person, campus-based programming through June 27 is cancelled. A decision on holding in-person programs from June 28 to early August will be made once more information on the pandemic becomes available and public health experts advise university leadership. Programs scheduled for the entire summer are encouraged to operate remotely or online, in case cancellations must continue beyond June 27.</p>\n<p>Students should consult their individual schools and programs to explore options for alternate summer study, research, and work. Some, such as Yale Summer Session, already offer an array of online choices.</p>\n<p>Visitors to Campus in Summer</p>\n<p>All visitors to campus are subject to the same guidelines as the campus community. The uncertainty surrounding when we will be able to resume normal operations dictates that all visits to Yale should be postponed at least until June 28.</p>\n<p>Summer international travel prohibited</p>\n<p>All university-sponsored international travel is prohibited through August 15. Please note that this guidance pertains to everyone – faculty, staff, fellows, undergraduates, and graduate and professional students. This includes study abroad (whether the program is operated by Yale or another institution), internships, fellowships, exchanges, business travel, group travel, and any other activities that involve university-administered funds (including grant funds) or credit.</p>\n<p>We urge you to consider carefully any personal travel and avoid all international travel if possible. Keep in mind that any travel may be disrupted in the coming months. We know from experience that travelers may be stranded when governments impose bans with little notice. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and many foreign governments have issued guidance to discourage travel or implemented travel restrictions. It is unclear when any of these will be lifted or, once lifted, whether they may be reinstated. You may have noted news of resurgent outbreaks in parts of Asia, a further sign of the unpredictability of the pandemic and another reason to limit travel.</p>\n<p>Summer domestic travel discouraged</p>\n<p>At this time, the university is asking all members of the community to avoid non-essential domestic travel. Please note that the CDC has issued a travel advisory urging residents of Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York in particular to refrain from non-essential travel. COVID-19 is also present in all 47 other states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and other U.S. jurisdictions. The pandemic may evolve in different ways and at different times in various parts of the United States. The advisory notes that crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase chances of getting COVID-19 if there are other travelers with coronavirus infection. The CDC website contains a list of things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we suggest that you limit domestic travel. Please do not make any advance, non-refundable purchases of airline, hotel, or other services until further notice. Please consider other options in case domestic travel turns out not to be safe or feasible.</p>\n<p>International Student Visas</p>\n<p>Routine U.S. consular services worldwide remain suspended, which will make obtaining a visa challenging for international students and scholars. When making travel plans, returning students should consider the risk of delays in any necessary visa renewals. The Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) continues to process visa documents for newly admitted students, so that when visa services reopen students will have the documents they need to schedule their visa appointments. OISS is monitoring this situation daily and is posting all updates on the OISS COVID-19 page. The university will provide further guidance on these matters in early summer.</p>\n<p>We understand fully that many of our students—and students at partner institutions around the world—rely on activities during the summer as an integral part of their academic program. It is difficult to impose restrictions on these activities, but these extraordinary times necessitate extraordinary measures to ensure everyone’s safety and health. We know this will present some disruption and stress for students, families, faculty, and staff, but we also trust that many of our programs will confront this challenge by conceiving and executing innovative approaches that continue our educational and research missions.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Scott Strobel</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>Henry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry</p>\n<p>Pericles Lewis</p>\n<p>Vice President for Global Strategy</p>\n<p>Douglas Tracy Smith Professor of Comparative Literature</p>","id":"3b833aab-9100-5c14-a4dd-3b95ace27967","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-yale/2020-04-10-14_04_39/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Guidance on Travel and Summer Programs"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://president.yale.edu/sites/all/themes/yalenew_base/images/favicon.ico\"></p>\n<p>Dear Friends,</p>\n<p>In the midst of these unique and unsettled times, many of us are preparing to celebrate important, even joyful, holidays. Millions of people around the world are marking Holy Week, leading up to Easter this Sunday. The Jewish holiday of Passover—eight days commemorating the Hebrew people’s exodus from slavery in Egypt—begins this evening. For many reasons, now seems like a fitting time for all of us, whether we are religious or not, to take a moment to pause and reflect on our world and our place in it.</p>\n<p>Holidays are, by definition, different from other days. They ask us to change our routines, to eat special foods, and to spend our time in unusual ways. This week, when Marta and I celebrate Passover, we know it will feel different from previous years. We will be thinking of all those who are ill, who are caring for those who are sick, and who have lost loved ones during this difficult time. And although we will miss gathering with friends and family members, as well as the delightful services and sedarim organized by the Slifka Center, knowing that Jewish and non-Jewish people have celebrated this same ritual for thousands of years—many in far more trying circumstances than our own—gives us hope. Remembering those Passover celebrations throughout history reminds us of our connections to one another, across time and space. And it strengthens our resolve to focus on what is most important in life and work.</p>\n<p>What we see, as clearly as ever, is a Yale community that has rallied together and demonstrated its finest qualities during this pandemic. Our frontline healthcare workers and first-responders are laboring around the clock to help others. Critical staff members are sustaining the university and its operations on campus, while many others have made significant adjustments in order to work from home. Yale faculty members and students are engaging fully in the shared endeavor of online teaching and learning, to wonderful results. Our public health experts, scientists, and scholars from across disciplines are steering us through this crisis. And our neighbors and partners in New Haven and throughout the state and region are showing a tremendous spirit of cooperation and goodwill as we work together to do what is best for our communities.</p>\n<p>Each of you has made enormous sacrifices, and you have demonstrated courage, resolve, and professionalism. You have done so while experiencing disruptions in your personal lives and while caring for children and loved ones. These sacrifices have not gone unnoticed, and they will not be forgotten.</p>\n<p>As part of the Passover Seder, we ask The Four Questions, beginning with, “How is this night different from all other nights?” Not only this night, but this period of time will be different for all of us. But it may also be an opportunity for us to connect, to learn, and to give thanks.</p>\n<p>So today, Marta and I give thanks for all of you and for Yale’s mission of light and truth, which has never been more urgent or vital. We see each day that our work has the power to alleviate suffering, to care for our neighbors, and to find answers that can save and improve lives. Together, we are writing new chapters in Yale history, and I know that your remarkable efforts are laying the foundation for an even stronger Yale to emerge when this crisis is over.</p>\n<p>This week will be different, but may we also find in the difference a measure of strength, beauty, and encouragement to sustain us in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Peter Salovey</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology</p>","id":"e62682f6-6ed4-5b23-8e07-df1fc211e696","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-yale/2020-04-10-14_04_41/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Message from President Peter Salovey on This Week's Holidays"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.wm.edu/images/social/default.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Sam Jones, chair of W&#x26;M's emergency management team and Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs sent the following messages to the campus community regarding COVID-19. - Ed.</p>\n<p>Jan. 25 | Informational Health Advisory</p>\n<p>April 8, 2020 Dear faculty and staff, The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated many changes in a short period of time in both our work and personal lives.

This order reinforces the guidelines on social distancing and restriction on congregating in groups of ten or more people he previously recommended. The new order does not impact our current operations. The directive is based on the advice of national and state health officials and continues to mean that all employees who can telework should do so. Faculty who must be on campus to conduct a lecture, should maintain a dedicated footprint (enter by the same door, visit the same office, use the same restroom) while in a university facility and then leave campus as soon as possible. Essential personnel should continue to be in contact with their supervisors. While the COVID-19 outbreak is far from over, either in our region or nationwide, we are at a pivot point operationally on campus. Moving forward, in addition to communication from the Emergency Management Team you will also receive communications directly from departments and units. The university’s COVID-19 website will remain a central source of information. We encourage you to refer to it often. This site was redesigned last week, we hope you find that helpful. If you have a question that is not addressed in the FAQs, you may continue to submit them at the bottom of that page. Stay well and safe. Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair Sam Jones, Emergency Management Team Chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, Vice President for Student Affairs</p>\n<p>COVID-19 Update XVII: Office remain closed to public walk-in traffic, other updates March 20, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community, Last weekend we announced that university offices would be temporarily closed to the public for walk-in access. Given the advice of federal, state and local health officials, we are extending that restriction through at least May 1. University offices remain operational and all employees who can work remotely should plan to telework through at least the end of the semester. This measure is part of a coordinated effort to support social distancing and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our area. Employees should not be on campus just because they prefer to work from their W&#x26;M office. Additionally, any member of this community who has been asked by public health officials to self-quarantine or self-isolate must follow those directives and should not be on campus. Please understand that these steps are being taken with the health and wellness of our entire community in mind. Everyone’s cooperation is greatly appreciated. Essential employees should continue to be in touch with their supervisors for their assignments. There has been a lot of information on a variety of topics this week. Our COVID-19 web hub, www.wm.edu/coronavirus, is the best central source for all information related to the university’s COVID-19 response. Highlighted below are a couple of items announced this week: Residence halls will close for the remainder of the spring semester for all students on Wednesday, March 25. Details related to this closure are available on the Residence Life website. Any residential student, including graduate and international students, with an issue or concern related to this should contact the Dean of Students Office at deanofstudents@wm.edu. We want to emphasize that in these difficult times, we remain committed to our William &#x26; Mary values of belonging and respect. This office is assisting students, international and domestic, in identifying viable options for accommodation based upon their individual situations, and they are in touch with those students.</p>\n<p>In addition to university offices being closed to the public, university buildings are in a “locked, but not closed” status. Under this status, employees are reminded they need their card key or manual key to enter buildings. Students who are still on campus have access to their residence hall (until March 25) and the Commons.</p>\n<p>And a couple of academic updates: Pass/Fail . The Provost’s Office has announced that Pass/Fail grading will be available for undergraduate courses through the end of the semester. Additional details are available on the University Registrar’s No Decision on Commencement . As President Rowe announced in her March 19 message to the W&#x26;M community, any decision on Commencement has been postponed until April. Summer Study Abroad . In light of COVID-19 developments around the world, including the US Department of State Global Level 4 Health Advisory – Do Not Travel as well as increasing travel restrictions in many countries, W&#x26;M has made the decision to cancel all summer study abroad programs. Students and faculty directly affected by these cancellations have been notified, and we are working to help support students as they adjust their academic plans. Remote Teaching &#x26; Learning . All in-person classes will be taught remotely beginning Monday, March 23 and continuing through the end of the semester. Resources are available online to faculty, staff and students for both connecting remotely to university resources and faculty for remote teaching and learning strategies.</p>\n<p>Also, we’d liked to remind each of you to take care of yourself. We have all experienced a lot of change in recent weeks and we need to take care of both our physical health and mental health. To aid in this, the McLeod Tyler Wellness Center has transitioned its in-house services to online delivery. We understand they had 160 members of our community “at” a yoga class this week. See the options at www.wm.edu/wellness/virtual. On that site is a special article on flourishing during unexpected change. We hope it will be a valuable resource for this community as we explore how to healthfully manage the wide range of emotions and thoughts associated with this challenging time. In true W&#x26;M fashion, look out for yourself and one another.

With that in mind, effective this morning, William &#x26; Mary is instituting a “locked, but not closed” policy for all W&#x26;M buildings, including VIMS. This means W&#x26;M buildings will be locked and only accessible by electronic or manual key to faculty, staff and students who require entry. The university is also asking our community members to always lock doors behind them when entering a facility. If you require entry, but do not have a key, please contact W&#x26;M Police at 757-221-4596. William &#x26; Mary closed all offices to the public on March 16, and advised employees to work remotely wherever possible. Students have been strongly urged to physically leave campus if they can; only limited services are available and access may be restricted further in the coming days. The W&#x26;M Post Office is currently open with limited access from 8 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday through Friday. The post office can be accessed through the sliding doors next to the Sadler Center loading dock. Community members whose buildings are locked can call 757-221-4491 to make arrangements for pick-up or delivery.

As of this notification, this is the first and only case of COVID-19 involving a member of the W&#x26;M community. That is very likely to change in the near future as more cases are diagnosed in the surrounding Williamsburg area.

The Virginia Department of Health is in the process of contacting people who may have been in close contact with this individual. If you have received a call from VDH regarding self-quarantine, please follow their instructions. If you have not received a call, you do not need to take specific action related to this case but please continue practicing good preventative hygiene measures and limit close interaction with others as much as practically possible. We are in contact with VDH and are closely following their recommendations. Please remember that amidst this serious pandemic, the vast majority of affected individuals will develop only mild to moderate symptoms. Preparation, not panic, will provide the best assurance that the health of our community is protected. The campus remains open and operating under the interim policies announced March 11.

We want to provide you additional details on the interim policies President Rowe announced in her March 11 message. Information and links are below and please remember that www.wm.edu/coronavirus is the best source for all W&#x26;M-related information. Thank you to all members of the community who continue to reach out and contact us via the website question box and the Call Center. Your feedback and information is very helpful in our planning and communications. Yesterday, we posted detailed frequently asked questions for faculty, staff and students. We are also reopening the Call Center this afternoon until 5 p.m. That number is 757-221-1565. Here are some important updates and reminders: Working Remotely. Over the coming weeks the university will continue normal administrative operations, albeit with some adjustments. These adjustments — in relative order of priority — include a) utilizing telework if appropriate b) practicing social distancing in work spaces, c) using flexible scheduling of staff and d) developing creative solutions. The health and safety of our employees is a priority and following CDC guidelines for social distancing and hygiene are the first and best courses for action. If an employee does not already have a current telework agreement, they should start the approval process by speaking with his/her supervisor. Supervisors will be flexible in allowing employees who have appropriate work and are able to work remotely to do so. Ultimately, approval by the unit vice president, vice provost, dean or their designee(s) is required to telework during the COVID-19 emergency. That approval will be obtained by the supervisor. Not all requests to telework can be approved due to the nature of the job. HR will be providing training sessions for supervisors on telework principles and policies March 16 and 19. Contact HR for details. Emergency Leave. With Governor Northam’s declaration of a state of emergency, university employees have access to Emergency Health Leave. This leave is available to both salaried and hourly employees and may be used for an employee’s own illness or to take care of an immediate family member. The leave is for illness or care directly related to COVID-19 and is to be used prior to any existing leave an employee may already have. Please contact HR if you have questions regarding eligibility. Residence Hall Access. Yesterday, Residence Life provided detailed information regarding residence hall access and student services. Swem Library has modified operating hours on its website and a list of building access times is available on the university’s COVID-19 website. Grading Guidance. The deadline for faculty to enter midterm grades for undergraduate courses has been extended to Sunday, March 29. Additionally, the deadline for undergraduate, graduate A&#x26;S and marine science students to withdraw for a grade of “W” from full-semester classes has been extended to Monday, March 30. Online instruction. As a reminder, the university has prepared this website to support the online instructional, remote learning and technology needs of faculty, students and staff as we transition to remote and online platforms. COVID-19 exposure/suspected exposure. Anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to a positive case of COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider. Staff should also call their supervisors, and faculty should also call their deans. Students on campus should call the Student Health Center. Supervisors and deans should contact the Emergency Management Team and the Student Health Center. We will continue to update you regularly as the situation warrants. We recognize that this is a challenging and potentially anxious time. As we work through this together remember our shared goals and the strength of our community spirit.

Back to the top Update VIII: COVID-19 - Spring Break March 6, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community - Spring break is here. Please enjoy a safe, healthy and relaxing time. Many of you have had questions regarding campus events. At this time, the only changes announced by the university involve study abroad and university-sponsored international travel. Anyone taking a personal trip over the break is reminded to follow CDC guidelines regarding restricted travel locations and, in the case of international travel, protocols and requirements for reentry into the United States. Links to those resources are available at www.wm.edu/coronavirus. This website remains the best source for information and updates related to our campus community and COVID-19. Also included on that site are FAQs regarding actions the university has taken and preparations related to COVID-19. There is also a comment box should you have a question that isn’t already addressed in the FAQs. Feedback and questions received via our online form will help inform future campus messages and information we include on the website. Over the break, please pay extra attention to the recommendations of health officials for the prevention of catching and spreading COVID-19, especially washing your hands regularly with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face and following CDC guidelines for quarantine or self-isolation if you have traveled. Upon your return, we expect the university to be operating under a normal class schedule. The Emergency Management Team will continue to monitor this situation and inform you of any updates. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update VII: COVID-19 - Spring Break &#x26; Ongoing Communications March 4, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – As you prepare for spring break and potentially leaving campus, please pay close attention to recommendations and guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Virginia Department of Health. The status of COVID-19 is changing rapidly both the United States and a number of countries overseas. Domestically, Covid-19 is now reported in 13 states and more than 75 other countries worldwide. If you are planning personal travel abroad over the break, please be advised that travel warning and restrictions are very fluid. Leaving the country at this time includes the risk of potentially not being able to leave the country you visit and/or delays or quarantines in returning to the United States. Anyone who is not a U.S. citizen should be especially aware of the possibility of U.S. government restriction on reentry. State Department and CDC websites are the best sources of the most up-to-date- information related to overseas travel. All official information on COVID-19 and the university’s response to it will continue to come from the W&#x26;M Emergency Management Team (Sam Jones in your Inbox). The information we share is important and we ask that you review each of these messages carefully. The Reves Center, and its Global Education website, are the information source for those who are currently studying abroad, or plan to do so in the summer or fall. Please contact the Reves Center as you have questions. The university will continue to update the website <a href=\"https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.wm.edu/coronavirus</a> on a daily basis so it remains a primary source for the most up-to-date information. Once you return to William &#x26; Mary, our focus will continue to be on prevention. All the standard rules apply. Wash your hands frequently and long enough to make a difference. Do not share water bottles, etc. If you are sick, go to the doctor. If you are sick, do not go to class, and faculty and staff should not come to work. Cough into you sleeve, or into a tissue which should be immediately discarded. Wipe down work and study spaces with a disinfectant. While these actions may seem basic, they are fundamental to preventing the spread of Covid-19 as well as other diseases. This video from Student Health Center Director Dr. David Dafashy is a good reminder of general COVID-19 information and prevention tips. Have an enjoyable and safe spring break. We look forwarding to seeing you back on campus and expect to be operating under a normal schedule for both classes and events. Sam Jones, emergency management team chair</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler, vice president for student affairs Back to the top Update VI: COVID-19 - New Travel Restrictions March 2, 2020 Dear William &#x26; Mary community – You have likely heard that travel warnings to both Italy and Iran were elevated over the weekend due to COVID-19 outbreaks. Given these additional warnings, all university-sponsored undergraduate student travel is now currently prohibited to Italy, China and South Korea and all other countries on our restricted destinations list. This new prohibition means that undergraduate students may not remain in Italy on university-sponsored travel at this time. The university’s Global Education Office is working individually with any of our students impacted by this. No decisions have been made yet regarding summer study abroad. The university is currently assessing the viability of specific summer programs and will be in contact soon with applicants.

And what a sweeping transition it has been — from adjusting to new virtual classroom experiences to expanded responsibilities at home, balancing work with the challenges of homeschooling our children or caring for loved ones as we shelter in place. While these changes are necessary to fight COVID-19, they aren’t always easy. Social isolation and physical distancing is hard. Working long hours amid looming economic uncertainties is trying. Being forced to abruptly develop a new way of teaching and learning mid-semester has been a challenge. Please know that you are not alone. At Emory, we recognize the many adjustments you face and feel the stress of those changes, too. We also have the resources and ability to help, even in this new age of physical distancing. Undergraduate and graduate students should know that Emory’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is offering telehealth clinical services, where you can speak with a counselor or talk with a member of a triage team who can make assessments and help guide next steps. CAPS is also offering virtual workshops at 2 p.m. on Friday afternoons via Zoom to help manage stress, anxiety and feelings of social isolation. In addition, a series of peer-led virtual discussion groups begins April 13 to address academics, concerns about the future, home life and feelings of loneliness. Learn more about CAPS services during COVID-19. Student Health Services is offering telehealth appointments for both COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 related health questions. To learn more, please visit Campus Life. For faculty and staff who may need emotional support, the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) offers free and confidential services to help promote emotional, behavioral and organizational health. To support the increasing needs of our faculty, staff, physicians, trainees and their families throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, FSAP now offers tele-mental health services through telephonic and video-conferencing sessions and consultations. Videoconferencing services are conducted through a HIPAA-compliant Zoom platform. To learn more about the emotional support services offered by FSAP or to find help for you or a family member, please contact FSAP at 404-727-WELL (9355), efsap@emory.edu, or www.fsap.emory.edu. FSAP also offers a range of educational webinars and group support sessions focused on leadership and team services, addressing topics that range from stress management strategies and tips for healthy remote working to resilience and conflict management coaching. For more information about working through the COVID-19 pandemic, Emory Human Resources has launched a dedicated website offering guidance, support and tips for the unique challenges we now face, whether it’s balancing work and family life, learning how to work remotely, taking care of ourselves, or figuring out how to get bills paid. Usha Rackliffe, associate professor of practice at Emory’s Goizueta Business School, consolidated publicly available resources that we have added to the COVID-19 site to help students, faculty and staff access information and resources, including information on mortgage payments, student loans, rent, taxes and credit cards to help our community get the help that we need during this unprecedented time. Knowing where to find reliable, accessible support along the way can help in managing challenging times, and we encourage you to explore and take advantage of the resources available to you. Throughout the journey, Emory stands with you.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Care and compassion are essential to our mission of education and service. These values have proven crucial in guiding our response to the coronavirus pandemic. Emory has long strived to create a community of belonging. Within that charge, we recognize the importance of standing together during difficult times to support and encourage one another. Across the nation and the world, however, fears over COVID-19 have sometimes erupted into anger and accusations, racism and xenophobia. Globally, reports of anti-Asian bias and blatant harassment have been on the increase. Sadly, these behaviors have even been directed at frontline health care workers in hospitals throughout the U.S. as they work to treat patients, save lives and serve the public — all under incredibly stressful conditions. And our students, while pursuing their education and resuming their lives, have not been spared from the hate. As we find our way forward, let us not forget our essential Emory values. Mean-spirited, untruthful, socially stigmatizing remarks, slurs and actions do not represent who we are as a community. In fact, they stand in direct opposition to our most foundational principles. Simply put, there is no room for hate at Emory. Please know that bias and harassment within our community will not be tolerated. Indeed, harassment of any person or group of persons on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap or veteran’s status is a form of discrimination specifically prohibited by university policy. If members of the Emory community encounter such behaviors, on or off campus, we want to hear from you. For more information and support, please contact the Emory University Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at 404-727-9867 or oei@emory.edu. We recognize that harassment takes many forms. Some members of the Emory community have recently reported encountering incidents of “Zoombombing” — instances of uninvited guests crashing online Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars in order to shout slurs and share offensive materials. While Zoom has options to combat such intrusions, Emory’s Library and Information Technology Services (LITS) team recommends that those concerned with unwanted intrusions should require meeting passwords or, for smaller meetings, use a “waiting room.” For step-by-step guidance, please visit here. Additional questions may be directed to videoservices@emory.edu. Spreading inaccurate information can too easily lead to scapegoating and other forms of disrespect, particularly aimed at persons of Asian descent. During this challenging time, we also urge members of the Emory community to seek out factual information, consulting official and evidence-based sources. For accurate information and updates on how the coronavirus is impacting Emory, please visit COVID-19 updates. At Emory, we all have a role in building our community of belonging aided by members who are respectful of one another and find value in the richness and complexity of our shared diversity. Our inability to be physically present with one another offers an opportunity for us to demonstrate support for each other and to form an even deeper connection to our core values. Now more than ever, let us celebrate our Emory values and strengthen our fundamental bond, affirming the dignity and humanity of each other through our words and actions. Though apart, we remain, as always, in community.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Tips for preventing Zoombombing To avoid having your Zoom meetings interrupted, take the following precautions: Do not share Zoom links on social media or external facing websites; only communicate your Zoom links through email or other secure means.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, add a Password, which you would then communicate to your participants. They will be prompted to enter the password any time they attempt to enter the meeting room.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, enable a Waiting Room. This means you have to manually allow in any of your participants. Be sure to keep an eye on the waiting room, and click “admit” in the participant window to allow people in. Encouraging participants to enter the room with their full name will help you keep track of them. If you have a second meeting leader, this is a great job for them, so that you can lead the meeting and someone else can manage the participant list.</p>\n<p>While in the room, you can also limit the screen sharing capacity just to the host. This will not work if your participants need to share their screens, but if they do not, follow these steps to limit the sharing. Be sure to take the time to familiarize yourself with Zoom’s settings and features so you understand how to protect your virtual space when you need to. Resources LITS has tips and advice on Zoom settings to avoid Zoombombing.</p>\n<p>The Emory Police Department also has some helpful tips. What to do if you experience Zoombombing If you are hosting a Zoom call with an Emory-sponsored Zoom account and the call gets Zoombombed, please report the incident to the Emory Police Department by calling 404.727.6111 (TDD/TTY 404.320.1024) or by reporting the incident via LiveSafe.</p>\n<p>April 2, 2020 2:01 PM Change to S/U Option Emory College Students Today we are announcing changes to the S/U grading basis plan, which now includes an extended deadline and petition option. We want to share more information on how these changes will affect Emory College students specifically. Changes to S/U Grading Option We will extend the current S/U change deadline until April 27 (the last day of class for this semester).</p>\n<p>the current S/U change deadline until (the last day of class for this semester). After April 27, students will have the option to submit a petition to request a change from a letter grade to S/U basis. Petition information will available on the Committee on Academic Standards website no later than April 24, 2020. Students must submit their petition for consideration by the following deadline: Graduating Seniors – May 11 All other students – May 18</p>\n<p>Spring 2020 Study Abroad students who are considering changes to the grading basis of their courses must contact their Study Abroad Advisor in order to make any changes. They cannot make changes in OPUS. Other Academic Options There have been no other changes to the academic options available to you. Withdrawal Petition is available until April 10</p>\n<p>Extended Withdrawal Deadline (for First-Year, Oxford and Transfer students) is April 3</p>\n<p>Incompletes may be requested in discussion with your academic advisor through April 27. We have been listening to the concerns that students have raised that S/U grades may put them in less competitive positions without a universal mandate. We especially appreciate the desire expressed in an on-line petition, and elsewhere, to protect the most vulnerable members of our student community. At the same time, we understand that many students want to pursue letter grades this semester. Please be assured that these issues are happening across higher education, and graduate and medical schools will all be aware of the extraordinary circumstances facing students in Spring 2020. In weighing the different grading possibilities for this semester, we have worked to understand and meet the different needs of our students as they seek to continue their academic careers during the distress of this global health crisis. There is no grading system that does not involve some tradeoff, and we recognize that no system will address all the concerns of all of our students. We know that this semester is an extraordinary one, and we want to assure everyone that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to help our students thrive during a challenging time. For questions or concerns about grading policies and practices, students should contact oue.advising@emory.edu</p>\n<p>Best wishes, Shari Obrentz, Associate Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Dan Dillard, Assistant Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Steve Savage, Associate Director of Communications, Office for Undergraduate Education</p>\n<p>March 30, 2020 5:00 PM Emory Together with Laney Alumni Graduate Students Dear Friends, Across our communities, at Emory, and in our homes with family and friends, we are all experiencing circumstances that we would never imagine. I want you to know that I am thinking of you and your loved ones and hope that you are safe and well. At the onset of the global public health crisis and continuing as long as it is needed, Emory is taking extraordinary steps to safeguard the health and well-being of the campus community. On March 23, the University transitioned to remote learning and remote work for our students, faculty, and staff. We will closely monitor and assess next steps as this situation continues to evolve. I am so very proud of how our students, faculty, and staff at Emory University and in Emory Healthcare are working together to address the needs of our communities. We need each other now more than ever. The impact of COVID-19 has created logistical and financial implications for many members of our communities. Emory is working to provide support in various ways and has launched the EmoryTogether Fund to assist with emergency needs. The added support of our alumni and donors will amplify efforts to provide funds for food, housing, health, travel, remote learning, family, and other COVID-19-related expenses. Here's how you can help. If you are able, please donate to the EmoryTogether Fund and join us in response to this pandemic. Alumni play an essential role in all that we do at Emory. We need your help now to ensure the continued progress and success of our students. We value your partnership and ask that you join with the Laney Graduate School to help students navigate these trying times with minimal disruption to their academic progress. Thank you again for your continued support of our students and the Laney Graduate School. Please stay safe and stay hopeful. With you, with great appreciation, -Lisa Lisa A. Tedesco, Ph.D. Vice Provost for Academic Affairs – Graduate Studies Dean, James T. Laney School of Graduate Studies Professor, Rollins School of Public Health Emory University</p>\n<p>March 30, 2020 10:03 AM Emory’s Commitment to Health and Safety Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, In any public health crisis, it is imperative that information be shared with community members while protecting patient privacy. As our community has shifted to distance learning and remote work in many areas, and the rate of cases in Georgia rapidly increases, it has become clear that it will be difficult for Emory to maintain an accurate count of members of our community who are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. For this reason, we have revised our approach to reporting confirmed cases and will no longer send announcements about illnesses on campus. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 in Georgia or Metro Atlanta, please refer to the Georgia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19 tracking. Our commitment to the health and safety of our community is unwavering as we continue to work closely with local and state health partners to monitor and manage COVID-19 and address its impact on our community. Leadership in Academic Affairs and Business Administration is currently working with schools and units to define essential activities on campus and provide guidance to both faculty and staff. We will focus our attention on around-the-clock actions to protect students, faculty, and staff who remain on campus. If your function is deemed essential and you are required to come to campus but feel you are in a high-risk group due to your age or a medical condition, please talk to your supervisor or HR representative for working options. In the event of illness If you are a student who has relocated out of Atlanta , and have become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat), call your primary care provider.</p>\n<p>, and have become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat), call your primary care provider.

If you are faculty or staff, and become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) go home immediately, contact your health provider, and do not return to work. If you are ill and unable to work, contact your supervisor, program director, department chairperson, or dean’s office. So that we may understand critical workforce needs, it is very important for you to indicate your use of sick leave in the Exempt Leave Tracking or Time and Attendance System. After illness, the Office of Injury Management (OIM) can help assess an employee’s readiness to return to work.</p>\n<p>(fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) go home immediately, contact your health provider, and do not return to work.

If you are asymptomatic, you may be able to continue to work and should self-monitor for symptoms. Everyone can do their part to keep themselves and their friends and families safe by practicing social distancing both inside and outside. Social distancing is defined as remaining out of group settings, avoiding gatherings, and maintaining a 6 feet distance from others when possible per the CDC guidelines. Emory takes the health of our faculty, students, and staff very seriously and we are doing everything within our power to keep our community safe.

To best serve our students who requested to remain on campus this semester, and maintain important community bonds, we have brought students from our Oxford and Atlanta campuses together on Emory’s Clairmont campus, where we can provide each student residential single-room accommodations. Oxford students and their belongings were transported to their new accommodations by shuttles, which were staggered to support social distancing. Once settled, Oxford faculty and staff, along with Atlanta campus colleagues, will be available to continue to support all students remaining on campus throughout the semester. Our Oxford students traditionally transition to Atlanta after their sophomore year with strong bonds in place, ready to take on leadership positions at Emory University. These same students are being welcomed to their new homes earlier than anticipated on a campus that is eager for them to feel at home. Resources have been put in place to help them create a new kind of bond with their fellow students and professors at Emory College during this unprecedented time. Many thanks to our resilient Oxford College students for making this transition and also to the many dedicated staff members on both campuses who’ve helped support them throughout the move. We appreciate everyone’s patience as we continue to adapt to new challenges, and we wholeheartedly welcome Oxford to the Atlanta campus. In times of uncertainty, there is comfort in community. We’re grateful you are part of ours.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

From staff members who’ve helped Emory students move and kept a labyrinth of campus operations running smoothly to our remarkable, resilient faculty who’ve deftly transitioned to online learning platforms — and countless others — we thank you for your hard, ongoing work. Beginning this week, Emory Report is launching a series dedicated to shining a light on those critical efforts, exploring how our staff members are supporting the daily work of the university, laboring tirelessly behind the scenes to help advance our academic goals. We remain committed to supporting those members of our community who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. That extends to individuals who contribute to many facets of Emory’s operations and who are being significantly affected by changes brought by COVID-19. In recognition of those impacts, we have advocated on behalf of Bon Appetit workers to ensure they are protected from a sudden loss of earnings. Through this collaboration, the Bon Appetit employees who support both campuses will continue to receive their regular earnings and benefits through the end of the semester. Last week we announced a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund to support students. This week the Emory Together Fund was widened to cover faculty and staff experiencing direct challenges as a result of COVID-19. By helping meet their most pressing and immediate needs, the Emory Together Fund can give members of the Emory community the ability to overcome the difficult obstacles presented by COVID-19 and future emergencies. The Emory Together Fund includes a $50,000 matching challenge to encourage the Emory community to pitch in to help students, faculty, and staff address financial difficulties, like those presented by COVID-19. In the long-term, the Emory Together Fund will continue to provide financial resources to students, faculty, and staff of Emory University to overcome future challenges. More information, including an application form and guidelines for staff and faculty, is available on Emory’s Human Resources Emory Together Fund website. As we face the challenges of each new day, Emory will continue to honor our core values and mission, supporting our community and embracing our work with creativity, collaboration and commitment. Together, we are stronger.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Course Grading Your student has received information on grading for this semester. We are offering students the option to change their grading basis from a letter grade to satisfactory/unsatisfactory, to petition for a late, single, course withdrawal without penalty or to request incomplete grades.

We know that this is an unusual situation and we are working to offer practical solutions to the challenges we know that some students are facing. Commencement 2020 It is with great sorrow that the University has had to cancel our Commencement exercises in May 2020. I want to underscore that we are proud of all our graduating students and, as Dean Elliott noted in a message to them directly, will find a way to honor and celebrate all that they have accomplished at another time in the future. While those plans are still being formulated, we will keep your student updated. We look forward to celebrating them appropriately soon.

That swift transition represents a cultural sea change from our normal academic routines and campus operations, and its success is due, in no small part, to each and every one of you. Congratulations on embracing the rapid changes necessary to keep our learning channels — and our community — strong, stable and functional. For some of us, learning and working online will be familiar. For others, it may represent a first-time experience. Together, we are making it work — every day, finding our way forward. And with each success, both large and small, our confidence and resolve is strengthened. We recognize that the rough edges of this transition have been smoothed by the dedication of many, many individuals, whose tireless, behind-the-scenes efforts have helped keep the very machinery of Emory humming. Our deepest thanks goes out to all Emory students, faculty and staff for the hard work, long hours and resilience you’ve demonstrated in going the extra mile to make this possible. It has been an extraordinary effort. As we continue adapting to change, an important reminder: For students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, starting this week all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. Amid these new developments, we also want to acknowledge important, long-standing traditions here at Emory. As we move together as a community through this spring semester — always a time of growth and renewal — we’re also preparing to welcome our newest cohort of student scholars, the Class of 2024. The evening of Wednesday, March 25, our final round of admitted first-year students will receive their eagerly awaited confirmation emails, inviting them to join the Emory community. It’s not hard for students to recall the anticipation you may have felt as a high school senior awaiting that notification as you decided where to enroll. We absolutely share in that excitement. We also want to recognize the important work being done by teams at the Office of Admission on the Atlanta campus and the Office of Enrollment Services on the Oxford campus to share admissions information with prospective Emory students. In the days ahead, those offices will continue working diligently to provide new remote opportunities for future Eagles to connect with current students, faculty, and staff. For the latest developments in our new normal together, we invite you to check out the recently relaunched Emory COVID-19 website, which now features information organized to provide quick answers for faculty, staff and students, including important resources for remote learning and working. Thank you for standing with Emory as we face our shared challenges — honoring the past, while building toward the future.

As we announced last week, the fund will help with the emergency financial needs of full and part-time degree-seeking students enrolled at Emory as of March 11, 2020, who demonstrate verifiable financial hardship related to COVID-19. Assistance may include help with a range of challenges associated with COVID-19, including basic needs (food, special housing circumstances, medicine, etc.), educational support needs (travel to a safe learning location, remote learning needs, etc.), and family/medical needs (job loss, medical deductible, etc.). Starting today, qualified students with direct COVID-19 related financial hardships are encouraged to apply for support through this fund, which will be available from March 23, 2020, through June 30, 2020. Applications should be submitted through the Finance website. Emory’s Division of Campus Life, working with an oversight committee, will review all applications in consideration of special requests. Emory employees, who are enrolled in degree programs, are not eligible for support through this fund but are encouraged to seek support through the Emory University Hardship Fund, which assists faculty and staff. A reminder for students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, beginning today, Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. To help everyone in the Emory community gain access to quick reliable information, we will relaunch the Emory COVID-19 website with specific areas for faculty, staff and students to obtain the necessary resources for remote learning/working, latest guidelines and campus operations. Lastly, everyone should be practicing social distancing whether you are remote or on campus. The global pandemic COVID-19 has presented many moments of uncertainty, and together, we are navigating unprecedented challenges. As students enter a new week at Emory, beginning our new phase of remote learning, know that faculty, staff and administrators are here to offer support. Despite the distances that physically divide us, we are fully committed to ensuring your success and maintaining our bond as an academic community. For Emory, and the nation, this is an historic moment — a time defined by our collective efforts to maintain our educational mission and momentum as we work to help mitigate a global pandemic. Those are remarkable, worthy goals, and we believe this community is up to the challenge. Together, we are moving forward as educational pioneers. Our thanks goes out to everyone — students, faculty, staff and administrators — for all that you are doing, every day, to make that possible. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S.

The Emory community will advance into our new phase of remote learning and — for many staff members — working remotely. While that will necessarily bring changes, it won’t deter our mission to create and share knowledge, and it will not break our sense of community. While the changes we are experiencing may feel isolating and even overwhelming, in a remarkable way they have also brought us closer together, as we navigate this shared experience. And there are parts of the Emory experience that will not change. Emory faculty remain among the very best in their fields, with the resources and creativity to deliver an exceptional learning experience. Our talented staff remain dedicated to our mission and service to our students. And the resiliency of our student body is inspiring. Thank you to everyone for your contributions to our community. For everyone, confronting COVID-19 requires a big adjustment. But as you grapple with new challenges, please know that you are not alone — resources are available, along with people eager to help, even from afar. We encourage everyone to prioritize their mental health and wellbeing in the coming days and weeks. If you are on campus or if you are at home, the following resources are available to you: Students: Counseling and Psychological Services and Oxford Counseling and Career Services Staff: Working Through COVID-19 and FSAP. And each day, please take time for self-care. Get some fresh air, take a walk, get some exercise —all of which can be accomplished while maintaining social distancing. We are impressed with the many ways our students are maintaining relationships across the miles, and are hard at work to provide additional opportunities to connect and maintain the heart of Emory, even at a distance. For those students, staff and faculty who must remain on campus, we ask you to continue exercising care and compassion by practicing social distancing. That includes avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people and remaining six feet apart at all times. Under these federal recommendations, parties and large social gatherings are discouraged at this time. To support security and social distancing measures, Emory’s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have made adjustments to operating structures, which include campus building closures and reduced hours of operation and summer program cancellations: Atlanta and Oxford Campus Building Security and Access Beginning Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and will only be accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. While most faculty, staff and students have active Emory ID cards that will permit access to their buildings, we anticipate some may not. Those who lack required building access should coordinate access with your department and the EmoryCard office. Questions may be directed to: emorycard@emory.edu. Additional information about pop-up EmoryCard Office access will be provided in a separate communication. Atlanta Campus Closed or Reduced Hours of Operation Currently closed: Woodruff P.E. Center, Student Activity &#x26; Academic Center (excepting mail and dining), Emory Student Center, Alumni Memorial University Center, Schwartz Center for Performing Arts, Carlos Museum, Woodruff Library, Barnes &#x26; Noble</p>\n<p>Reduced hours: Dining hall hours will vary. Visit the Dining website for updated hours and availability.</p>\n<p>Boxed food options: For those remaining on the Druid Hills campus, boxed meals can be picked up in the Dobbs Common Table in the Emory Student Center at the hours indicated on the Dining website. Parking and Transportation Beginning Friday, March 20, until further notice, the parking decks listed below will have free entry/exit for use by Emory and Emory Healthcare personnel who are considered essential.

International Travel/Summer Study Abroad In keeping with the university’s indefinite suspension of international travel, Emory is canceling all Emory-sponsored undergraduate international travel for Summer 2020, including summer study abroad programs. Emory also encourages faculty and staff responsible for organizing any Summer 2020 Emory-sponsored international travel for graduate or professional students, either group or individual, to reconsider their plans, as such travel may not be allowed given the uncertain duration of the international travel suspension. This decision is being made in light of Emory’s international travel suspension and the possibility that planned summer travel could be disrupted by potential entry restrictions by the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, as Emory and its partners and colleagues abroad focus on their COVID-19 response, preparations that would normally be made to ensure safe and meaningful academic experiences abroad cannot be effectively executed. Students who have been planning Emory-sponsored travel should work with their units on any logistical or administrative issues resulting from this cancelation, such as the refund of paid deposits. Emory understands the importance of summer experiences abroad to students’ Emory program and remains committed to working with them to ensure academic continuity during this challenging time. As we continue to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic COVID-19 pandemic, we remain inspired and grateful for your help in facing change together. We encourage you to be patient next week with the faculty as we launch our courses remotely, with our staff as we implement new technology, and with each other as we find our new normal. The strength of our combined efforts today will go far in protecting the health and safety of everyone in the days to come. We can all play a role in helping turn the tide of this ongoing public health crisis. Thank you for doing your part. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 20, 2020 3:30 PM Oxford College: Getting Ready for Remote Learning Oxford College Students Dear Oxford College Students: As you prepare to transition to remote learning, Oxford College faculty and staff are doing the same. We have prepared FAQs to ready you for remote learning next week. You will certainly have many questions not addressed here. Your best source for up-to-date information from Emory University is our dedicated COVID-19 page. Please send specific questions about Oxford academics—classes, pre-registration, advising, and academic support—to the Oxford Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Please send general questions to OxfordDean@emory.edu for review and response. We are all finding new ways to help one another through these unprecedented times. Please know we are here to support you. Sincerely, Valerie Molyneaux</p>\n<p>Associate Dean for Academic Affairs</p>\n<p>Oxford College of Emory University 1. How do I resume class on Monday, March 23? Your faculty member for each individual class is scheduled to communicate with you by the end of the day on Thursday, March 19, 2020, about procedures for class. Some classes may be synchronous (real time as listed on OPUS, Eastern Standard Time). Others may be fully asynchronous (without real-time interaction). Some classes may have both synchronous and asynchronous elements. 2. What if I have not heard from my faculty member by the deadline? Please wait until the deadline has elapsed. Faculty may need every moment to prepare and communicate their plans for this major transition. After that, please contact Oxford College’s Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Valerie Molyneaux, for assistance (vmolyne@emory.edu). 3. How can I prepare for remote (online) learning? If you have not already done so, please complete the Oxford College remote learning survey. Oxford College Information Technology is using survey responses to support students who report access difficulties or barriers, so please complete the survey to allow us to support you through this period of remote learning. As possible, establish a secure internet connection. Gather trouble-shooting information, such as passwords and internet provider customer service contact information. Test your equipment, making sure that you can see and be seen through your camera, and hear and be heard through your speaker(s) and microphone. Zoom, Emory’s telecommunication platform, offers a test meeting site to check your equipment. Oxford also has resources and support for remote learning. Remote (online) learning will present new challenges. Daily log-ins to Canvas, even for asynchronous courses; close and careful reading of class communications (ideally on a computer screen, not just a phone); a regular study routine (ideally in a distraction-free space reserved for study); and connecting virtually with faculty and classmates can all help. 4. Can I use Oxford/Emory library materials? Access to Emory University databases, eJournals, and our large collection of digital books and reference tools will continue to be available online. Please see the Remote Library Resources and Services Guide for details about accessing these resources. Contact the Oxford Library at 770.784.8380, through email at ox-librarystaff@listserv.cc.emory.edu, or through the chat widget on the Oxford Library homepage. Please watch EaglePost for an announcement from your Oxford College Library about expanded access to online textbook/ course materials from select publishers. 5. How will I register for fall classes? Due to extended Spring Break, the timeline for Fall 2020 pre-registration has delayed one week. Official enrollment appointments will be updated by Wednesday, March 18 in OPUS. If you have questions about enrollment or registration, please contact the Advising Support Center (oxadvising@emory.edu). As of Tuesday, March 17, 2020, no changes or decisions have yet been announced regarding whether summer and future semesters will be offered remotely or in person. At this time, we are planning for regular operations; all updates will be communicated to students, faculty, and staff by the Office of the Provost. 6. How will I participate in academic advising? Rising second-year students (Oxford Class of 2021): work directly with your faculty advisor. If you have not heard from your advisor by March 27, 2020, please contact the Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Rising juniors/ graduating sophomores (Oxford Class of 2020): you have several advising options. Students who have declared a major in Emory College may receive separate communications from major departments. All Oxford students continuing to Emory College have a professional advisor in the Office for Undergraduate Education (Emory College’s equivalent to Oxford’s ASC); click here to find your advisor. Students continuing to the Goizueta Business School and School of Nursing, you will hear directly from the BBA and BSN programs about advising and registration procedures. Oxford faculty advisors and the ASC are always available to give general advice to rising juniors/ graduating sophomores as well. 7. Will I stay on track to graduate? Students will be provided equivalent opportunities to complete their current spring semester classes that they would have had during residential learning. 8. What happens to the accommodations I have on file through the Department of Accessibility Services? While the structure of an online course may eliminate the need for many typical classroom accommodations, the environment may also create a unique set of needed accommodations. Communicate with your faculty as soon as possible to understand how the change of instruction may affect your accommodations. Visit Accommodate for more information. The Department of Accessibility Services will remain open Monday-Friday, 8am – 5pm, EST. All student appointments will be conducted via phone or virtually until further notice. DAS will not proctor exams while remote instruction is in place. If you have any questions or concerns, please email the Oxford office: oas_oxford@emory.edu. 9. Is academic support still available? Yes, remotely! Please see details below. Writing Center The Writing Center will be open for individual online consultations from 2PM to 10PM EST, Sundays through Thursdays through the end of the semester. Consultations will take place through Google docs and Zoom. To make an appointment, visit oxford.mywconline.com.

As each day brings new challenges, we want to help students feel confident about maintaining their academic progress. We also recognize a hard truth: Emory undergraduate, graduate and professional students of various income levels and backgrounds may incur financial hardships as a result of COVID-19. In order to respond to these emerging needs and offer support to our students in crisis, Emory has established a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund which will be managed by Campus Life. More information about this new fund — and application guidelines — is anticipated to be released on Monday, March 23, 2020. In addition, students may request the option of satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading in place of a letter grade for a course or courses taken during the Spring 2020 term. Faculty members may also request that a graded course be changed to satisfactory/unsatisfactory based on changes related to the move to remote learning. Schools and colleges will review these requests and respond to them through school-based governance policies and committees, and additional information will be provided to you soon by your school. As always, we appreciate the flexibility and willingness to embrace these grading modifications that have been demonstrated by our faculty and students. As we move forward together in adapting to new learning styles, know that Emory will continue to seek ways to best support our community. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare</p>\n<p>March 18, 2020 6:06 PM Message from Dean Michael Elliott Emory College Students Message from Dean Michael Elliott I wanted to communicate with you directly about a few things that I am feeling and thinking as we approach the \"new normal\" of remote teaching.

It is with great sadness that I write to let you know we have made the difficult, but absolutely necessary decision, to cancel our traditional May commencement activities. However, I also want to share with you that planning already is underway to celebrate and commemorate the Class of 2020 as we are living in an extraordinary time. We did not make this decision lightly. I recognize that it will cause disappointment, especially for our graduates and their loved ones. But cancellation of the on-campus activities is, at present, the one option that ensures the safety and well-being of our Emory community members. We must be proactive in our mitigation efforts against COVID-19. Nevertheless, I apologize that we will not have our regular graduation celebrations, and wanted to let you know as soon as possible to help you with your plans. Thankfully, cancellation will not be the last word. Together, we will recognize all that you have accomplished and celebrate your creativity, resilience, and resolve. I wish you great success as you move forward into the next phase of your lives. I appreciate your patience and continued understanding as we navigate these challenges. Most of all, I encourage each member of the Emory community to continue to care for yourselves and your families during these very stressful times. We will remain guided by our mission of putting knowledge to work in the service of all humanity. The present times call for compassion and for courage. With gratitude, Claire E. Sterk</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 4:00 PM Guidance for LGS Student Research &#x26; Academic Progress Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Dear LGS Community, As you are aware, Emory University is taking extraordinary steps to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. I write to provide guidance on what this means for LGS. All LGS students should begin working remotely immediately, to the fullest extent possible, with transitions completed no later than Friday, March 20, 2020. Faculty advisors should work with their graduate students to develop individualized plans to continue their research remotely. All LGS students who currently receive stipends, including those supported by research grants, will continue to receive their stipends. LGS students should not be assigned as essential lab personnel with on-campus responsibilities. No student may be compelled to come to campus for any purpose.Faculty must be flexible to support remote work arrangements for LGS students. In the event that a laboratory engaged in essential research activities requires an LGS student to maintain a physical presence in the lab, this must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director, the PI’s Department Chair, and the Dean of the Laney Graduate School. The resulting decision will be reported to the PI’s School/Unit Dean. LGS will provide additional guidance and update the FAQs on the LGS COVID-19 webpage. LGS will work closely with graduate programs to mitigate the impact on student academic progress in order to meet the academic needs of each student. We recognize that transitioning certain kinds of research activities to remote work will require careful planning and may affect academic progress. We will provide further guidance as the implications for the research environment continue to unfold. If you have questions or concerns about academic progress, please reach out to your Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director. Students outside of lab environments should contact Interim Assistant Dean Mackenzie Bristow. Students in lab environments should contact Associate Dean Amanda Marie James. Directors of Graduate Studies/Program Directors should contact Senior Associate Dean Cathryn Johnson. During these rapidly evolving circumstances, we must work together and stay connected to protect our community. We appreciate your partnership and efforts to keep our community safe. Please regularly check the Emory University and LGS COVID-19 webpages for more information. Stay strong and resolute in your practices to curtail and stop transmission. Be patient and responsibly flexible and take time for self-care.</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 11:14 AM Emory’s Commitment to our Community Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, To strengthen our investment of support for students, faculty and staff during a time of unprecedented disruption, Emory leadership will provide a series of financial initiatives, which are as follows: Refund of Unused Fee Emory will refund student accounts with a calculated amount of unused housing, dining, athletic fees, activity fees, parking fees, and other fees unrelated to academic instruction. Since instruction will continue, no instructional costs will be reimbursed (tuition, technology fees, etc.) Other services that will remain available to students, such as health related fees, will also not be refunded. Federal Work Study Income Replacement The Department of Education has authorized the payment of unutilized Federal Work Study funds to each impacted student. The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) has reviewed the funds available and is in the process of calculating the amount eligible under this program, to be awarded to eligible students in the next week. High Financial Need Student Support Stipend We understand that Emory undergraduate students with the highest financial need will experience the greatest impact associated with the expedited closure of the resident halls and shift in academic delivery. With that in mind, Emory will provide an immediate “Student Support Stipend” to eligible undergraduate students in the amount of $1,000 within the next week. Students will be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid. Student Employee Salary Replacement Emory students of various income levels and backgrounds hold jobs at Emory and are classified as student employees. These jobs may be administrative, research focused, athletic support or various other activities. The rate of pay is different for each student employee and the hours may vary by job as well as by week-to-week availability, depending upon the student’s academic load and the unit’s need. We are concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the financial well-being of these students who depend on this income in their financial planning. As a means of supporting our student employees as the university moves to remote work and students are leaving campus, we propose to pay estimated earnings for the remaining weeks of the term based on their historical time worked. Students may check with their hiring unit to see if it is possible to continue to work remotely and may be paid for that time as well. Emory Employees Pay and Compensation We are making the commitment that regular faculty and staff employed by Emory University will be paid as usual for the current anticipated duration of the social distancing protocols, no matter their role within Emory and the altered learning/working environment. The process and details are still in development, but we are committed to continuation of pay from Emory during this time of uncertainty. Emory’s administration is committed to our students’ health and well-being, and we are dedicated to supporting their educational journeys with creativity and innovation as they progress along chosen academic pathways. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 16, 2020 7:20 PM Emory Update and Resources Especially for You Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students Dear Parents and Families, Here at Emory, students have always been our most important priority. And so it is natural that we share your deepest concerns for their success and wellbeing. Amid these uncertain times, that’s one reason we are committed to open communication that provides accurate, up-to-date information. A few days ago, we notified the Emory community that two undergraduate students staying at Dobbs Hall and the Clairmont campus were being tested for possible COVID-19. While awaiting test results, the students self-isolated in off-campus housing provided by the university. Today, we can report that both students have tested negative; they will remain in off-campus housing until other arrangements can be made. A third Emory student who lives off campus was tested for possible COVID-19, and has also tested negative. On March 16, two undergraduate students residing at Emory Point tested positive for COVID-19. Both students are in satisfactory condition and are self-isolating in their off-campus apartment. The students, who had left campus for spring break, have not been on the Emory University campus for more than a week; they did not report feeling ill until they returned from the break. Please be assured that Emory’s student health services and other environmental safety personnel interview all individuals within the campus community who test positive for COVID-19. Those interviews not only determine a patient’s contacts and activities, they help guide the university in taking action to safeguard the community’s health. Emory will update the public on COVID-19-specific updates and information via the Emory COVID-19 website, “Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community.” When the spread of COVID-19 was first reported in the U.S., Emory increased the frequency and intensity of its cleaning regime in all areas of the university, focusing on commons areas such as bathrooms, dining facilities and meeting rooms. If students or other members of the university community are tested for COVID-19 –– as with our two undergraduate students who were tested on March 14 — their rooms and workspaces will be cleaned and disinfected as detailed above. We have been advising students to leave campus and, if possible, return to their homes. We understand that it is not possible for all, so Emory is prepared to provide support to those who are unable to relocate and have been granted an exemption. All other students must move out of the residence halls by March 22 at 5 p.m. If you are concerned about traveling to campus to help your student move out, please know that the university can pack and ship belongings or store them locally for your student. We can also make arrangements for you and your student to move out during non-peak hours. For those students who cannot leave campus, Student Health Services will remain open. At this time, our care model will be a hybrid of virtual assessment and in-person visits. In order to manage the volume and protect the health of our patients and caregivers, Student Health Services will identify via phone the best course to seek treatment for those who feel unwell. Students with urgent concerns should call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 or Oxford Student Health Services at 770-784-8376. In the event of severe symptoms, including shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or chest pain, they should call 911 directly. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are working to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to partner closely with local and state agencies to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19.

We thank you for your patience as we continue to navigate this evolving situation. There are a lot of factors at play and we are working to resolve concerns as they arise. In this email we will begin to answer several questions that have been raised in regard to your academics directly with us or through your representatives on College Council.</p>\n<p>Fall 2020 Pre-Registration Pre-Registration will be delayed one week for all undergraduate schools. The new schedule is attached, and we have adjusted your registration appointments accordingly. Appointment times will remain the same, only the date has been amended. These times, which are all in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), should be viewable in OPUS now.</p>\n<p>If you have an advising appointment with a faculty member this week, please confirm with them if this will go ahead or if they would like to postpone your appointment. Faculty are working hard on revising course syllabi so please be flexible. Class Management &#x26; Faculty Expectations Individual instructors will provide you with exact details on course arrangements no later than 5 p.m. EDT on Thursday, March 19. We want to be clear with you regarding teaching expectations from the administration: Synchronous classes will meet at their regularly scheduled time, just in a remote format.</p>\n<p>Some course content may be delivered in an asynchronous format, or a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions. Each delivery method offers different learning opportunities for students that the other method could not provide. Students should expect that faculty will offer this combination.</p>\n<p>Faculty are expected to continue offering regular instruction, assessment and feedback throughout the duration of the semester.</p>\n<p>Faculty are expected to offer office hours through a virtual platform. You should confirm the times/availability of these directly with your faculty.</p>\n<p>Experiential Courses (labs, research, performance courses, internships, etc.) are under review. While you will be unable to continue these courses on campus, your instructors/coordinators are working hard to translate these into a suitable remote format. Some instructors have already provided information about alternative activities; others are working to develop options. More information will be provided as it becomes available. If any of the arrangements communicated by your instructors pose significant difficulties to you (e.g. time differences, lack of reliable internet), please reach out to them and explain your concerns. Faculty are prepared to work with you as best as they can. Technology Access If you do not have access to a computer or are concerned about regular internet access in your home location, please also reach out to OUE directly at oue.advising@emory.edu. Textbook Rentals The bookstore has announced that the textbook rental due date has been extended to May 23, 2020. They will also work with students who return rentals after this date to ensure that you not penalized in any way. Barnes and Noble does provide a free shipping label from UPS if students choose to return their rentals by mail.

Here is our pledge: As Emory enters this next chapter, we will strive to stay connected, maintaining our essential bond. Even though our community may not be together physically for an unforeseen time, we are committed to moving forward together, united in spirit and service and preserving the care and compassion that have long been a hallmark of this university. That is foundational to who we are as a community, and it will not change. Over the past 24 hours, we’ve understandably received many questions — concerns about housing, remote learning and working, and especially how to best help the Emory community, particularly our students. Many answers to those questions will be updated daily at Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, a website dedicated to our response to COVID-19. It is heartening to be joined by the broader Emory community in our commitment to serving our students. In fact, it’s been moving to see just how quickly support can coalesce. Even as students began packing to leave campus, the Emory Student Government Association was distributing free MARTA passes to help with transportation. We’ve seen staff members working long hours to assist students with specific needs, faculty rapidly developing online lesson plans, and caring alumni who’ve stepped forward to volunteer their help. That outpouring of support has been heartwarming and, of course, not unexpected. For those who are able and eager to help, please consider contributing to the student hardship fund . In addition, the faculty and staff hardship fund offers assistance to other members of our campus community who might be impacted by COVID-19. Moving forward, perhaps one of the most important things we can all do is stay strong and healthy for each other — for our communities, our families and our friends. Let’s work to preserve those connections, our fundamental human bonds. Amid these remarkable times, let us prove what a community can be. Together, we will be stronger for it.</p>\n<p>In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S.

With that in mind, we wanted to notify our community that two Emory University students in undergraduate housing are being tested for possible COVID-19. Neither case has been confirmed but, out of an abundance of caution, both students are self-isolating in off-campus housing provided by the university. The Emory community will be notified if one or both students test positive. The undergraduates live in Dobbs Hall and at the Clairmont Campus, respectively. Their roommates have been notified and are being supported by student health services staff. The students’ rooms have been cleaned and disinfected by Emory Environmental Health and Safety personnel. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are taking action around-the-clock to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to work closely with local and state partners to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19. We understand that the uncertainty and quickly changing dynamic around COVID-19 can bring stress and anxiety. Emory is committed to keeping our community informed and to provide as many resources as possible. Many of these resources and key updates can be found at Emory’s COVID-19 website. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases in Georgia and across the country, students should self-assess for fever or cough. Students who develop symptoms need to separate themselves from others and call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 (Clifton Rd. campus), or Oxford College Student Services at 770-784-8376. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

We are all disappointed about the need to transition to remote learning and, for many employees, remote working. But we are all dedicated to making the changes necessary to keep each other safe as we continue with the vital mission of the university “to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity,” which is needed now more than ever. Already, you are showing the strength and service that defines the Emory community. Students are reaching out to support each other. Faculty are coming together to adapt their courses for remote learning and plan how they will continue their research. At every level of the university, staff members are going the extra mile to make sure that everyone receives the information and resources they need for our community to continue to thrive even in the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Some of you may be frustrated or anxious in the face of these unprecedented circumstances for you, your family, the university and our broader community. Please know that we are working to answer your questions as quickly and thoroughly as possible in a rapidly evolving situation. Please visit our dedicated website, Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, daily for newly updated information and answers to common questions on topics ranging from health and support resources to classes, housing, travel, events, finances and other logistics as we all make this transition together. Please note especially the information on travel and events. In the coming days, we know that the Emory community will remain strong and connected by our common purpose, even if we are no longer together in person on our campuses. Beyond your courses or work assignments, continue to reach out to each other by phone or video to sustain our networks of care and compassion. And as you support each other, know that we are here to support you as well. In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Emory has now indefinitely suspended all official and previously authorized international travel and is strongly urging our campus community to postpone all university-sponsored domestic travel. Please view Emory’s latest travel restrictions here. We are continuing to monitor the situation and observe all guidance from Emory related to the Coronavirus. We will reopen the program when University directives advise that it is safe to do so. We do not know when that will be. Please continue to collect the necessary materials to apply for PDS funds once the program reopens. We intend to provide enhanced access to PDS funds at that time. During the PDS program suspension period, we will adjust the window for submitting follow-up documentation and reports. For trips/projects that have occurred during February and March 2020, you will now have up to 60 days from the end date to submit these items. Like many other disruptions related to the Coronavirus, this guidance may interfere with your professional plans in the coming months. We are very grateful for your patience and understanding. If you have any specific questions, please direct them to lgs.profdev@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 13, 2020 10:15 AM Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Extended Spring Break As a reminder, Emory University will extend spring break for students until Sunday, March 22, 2020. During this time, no in-person or remote classes should take place. The University will transition to remote learning beginning Monday, March 23. Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Qualifying examinations and thesis and dissertation defenses may take place on campus as scheduled. However, meetings should limit in-person participation to committee members only and options for remote participation must be offered. If desired, public participation may be arranged via remote connection. We strongly advise meeting participants who are considered at higher risk to participate remotely. Please consider social distancing and respiratory hygiene best practices for all meetings. For the remainder of the term, approval forms should be submitted electronically and include scanned signatures. Emory Zoom is recommended and useful for the practices above. Emory’s Teaching and Learning Technologies provides workshops, practice sessions, and instruction videos. Please submit any questions about defenses and exams to Ulf Nilsson at unilsso@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 12, 2020 1:00 PM Oxford Housing Move Out/Stay Request Form Oxford College Students Hello Oxford College Students, This communication is an outline to help you with planning next steps as a result of Emory University’s response to COVID-19.

Subject: Emory discontinuing on-site study abroad programs Dear study abroad students, In our email to you yesterday, we offered all study abroad students the option to return home and continue their studies remotely as programs permit. Since then, President Trump announced that most travel from Europe to the U.S. will be restricted for 30 days, and Emory University has decided to extend spring break and move to remote learning. We are reaching out to follow-up on our previous email amid the changing international landscape. As these changes highlight, international travel is growing increasingly inaccessible. Emory University is discontinuing all on-site study abroad programs. At this time, we are directing all study abroad students to return home and continue their studies remotely. We remain committed to working with you directly to determine the best method to maintain academic continuity. In most cases, this will mean completing online coursework provided by your current program or university abroad. If an online option is not available, we will work with you to make a contingency plan. These changes will obviously disrupt your semester plans. We ask that you be patient as we work with you to find an individualized solution for the remainder of your semester. Every student will have unique circumstances to consider when making plans to return home. Students who are not U.S. citizens, have underlying medical conditions, or have other extenuating circumstances should move quickly to make travel plans. If you are a non-U.S. citizen, you should arrange to travel immediately to a location that is suitab</p>","id":"72e85df6-4fd1-5188-b43f-a94afaf01de5","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-emory/2020-04-08-23_26_20/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Emory-Wide Remote Learning for Students"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>April 8, 2020 10:59 AM Emory Mental and Emotional Support Resources Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, By now, we’ve all experienced what it feels like to teach, learn and work remotely during a global pandemic. And what a sweeping transition it has been — from adjusting to new virtual classroom experiences to expanded responsibilities at home, balancing work with the challenges of homeschooling our children or caring for loved ones as we shelter in place. While these changes are necessary to fight COVID-19, they aren’t always easy. Social isolation and physical distancing is hard. Working long hours amid looming economic uncertainties is trying. Being forced to abruptly develop a new way of teaching and learning mid-semester has been a challenge. Please know that you are not alone. At Emory, we recognize the many adjustments you face and feel the stress of those changes, too. We also have the resources and ability to help, even in this new age of physical distancing. Undergraduate and graduate students should know that Emory’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is offering telehealth clinical services, where you can speak with a counselor or talk with a member of a triage team who can make assessments and help guide next steps. CAPS is also offering virtual workshops at 2 p.m. on Friday afternoons via Zoom to help manage stress, anxiety and feelings of social isolation. In addition, a series of peer-led virtual discussion groups begins April 13 to address academics, concerns about the future, home life and feelings of loneliness. Learn more about CAPS services during COVID-19. Student Health Services is offering telehealth appointments for both COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 related health questions. To learn more, please visit Campus Life. For faculty and staff who may need emotional support, the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) offers free and confidential services to help promote emotional, behavioral and organizational health. To support the increasing needs of our faculty, staff, physicians, trainees and their families throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, FSAP now offers tele-mental health services through telephonic and video-conferencing sessions and consultations. Videoconferencing services are conducted through a HIPAA-compliant Zoom platform. To learn more about the emotional support services offered by FSAP or to find help for you or a family member, please contact FSAP at 404-727-WELL (9355), efsap@emory.edu, or www.fsap.emory.edu. FSAP also offers a range of educational webinars and group support sessions focused on leadership and team services, addressing topics that range from stress management strategies and tips for healthy remote working to resilience and conflict management coaching. For more information about working through the COVID-19 pandemic, Emory Human Resources has launched a dedicated website offering guidance, support and tips for the unique challenges we now face, whether it’s balancing work and family life, learning how to work remotely, taking care of ourselves, or figuring out how to get bills paid. Usha Rackliffe, associate professor of practice at Emory’s Goizueta Business School, consolidated publicly available resources that we have added to the COVID-19 site to help students, faculty and staff access information and resources, including information on mortgage payments, student loans, rent, taxes and credit cards to help our community get the help that we need during this unprecedented time. Knowing where to find reliable, accessible support along the way can help in managing challenging times, and we encourage you to explore and take advantage of the resources available to you. Throughout the journey, Emory stands with you.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Care and compassion are essential to our mission of education and service. These values have proven crucial in guiding our response to the coronavirus pandemic. Emory has long strived to create a community of belonging. Within that charge, we recognize the importance of standing together during difficult times to support and encourage one another. Across the nation and the world, however, fears over COVID-19 have sometimes erupted into anger and accusations, racism and xenophobia. Globally, reports of anti-Asian bias and blatant harassment have been on the increase. Sadly, these behaviors have even been directed at frontline health care workers in hospitals throughout the U.S. as they work to treat patients, save lives and serve the public — all under incredibly stressful conditions. And our students, while pursuing their education and resuming their lives, have not been spared from the hate. As we find our way forward, let us not forget our essential Emory values. Mean-spirited, untruthful, socially stigmatizing remarks, slurs and actions do not represent who we are as a community. In fact, they stand in direct opposition to our most foundational principles. Simply put, there is no room for hate at Emory. Please know that bias and harassment within our community will not be tolerated. Indeed, harassment of any person or group of persons on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap or veteran’s status is a form of discrimination specifically prohibited by university policy. If members of the Emory community encounter such behaviors, on or off campus, we want to hear from you. For more information and support, please contact the Emory University Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at 404-727-9867 or oei@emory.edu. We recognize that harassment takes many forms. Some members of the Emory community have recently reported encountering incidents of “Zoombombing” — instances of uninvited guests crashing online Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars in order to shout slurs and share offensive materials. While Zoom has options to combat such intrusions, Emory’s Library and Information Technology Services (LITS) team recommends that those concerned with unwanted intrusions should require meeting passwords or, for smaller meetings, use a “waiting room.” For step-by-step guidance, please visit here. Additional questions may be directed to videoservices@emory.edu. Spreading inaccurate information can too easily lead to scapegoating and other forms of disrespect, particularly aimed at persons of Asian descent. During this challenging time, we also urge members of the Emory community to seek out factual information, consulting official and evidence-based sources. For accurate information and updates on how the coronavirus is impacting Emory, please visit COVID-19 updates. At Emory, we all have a role in building our community of belonging aided by members who are respectful of one another and find value in the richness and complexity of our shared diversity. Our inability to be physically present with one another offers an opportunity for us to demonstrate support for each other and to form an even deeper connection to our core values. Now more than ever, let us celebrate our Emory values and strengthen our fundamental bond, affirming the dignity and humanity of each other through our words and actions. Though apart, we remain, as always, in community.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Tips for preventing Zoombombing To avoid having your Zoom meetings interrupted, take the following precautions: Do not share Zoom links on social media or external facing websites; only communicate your Zoom links through email or other secure means.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, add a Password, which you would then communicate to your participants. They will be prompted to enter the password any time they attempt to enter the meeting room.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, enable a Waiting Room. This means you have to manually allow in any of your participants. Be sure to keep an eye on the waiting room, and click “admit” in the participant window to allow people in. Encouraging participants to enter the room with their full name will help you keep track of them. If you have a second meeting leader, this is a great job for them, so that you can lead the meeting and someone else can manage the participant list.</p>\n<p>While in the room, you can also limit the screen sharing capacity just to the host. This will not work if your participants need to share their screens, but if they do not, follow these steps to limit the sharing. Be sure to take the time to familiarize yourself with Zoom’s settings and features so you understand how to protect your virtual space when you need to. Resources LITS has tips and advice on Zoom settings to avoid Zoombombing.</p>\n<p>The Emory Police Department also has some helpful tips. What to do if you experience Zoombombing If you are hosting a Zoom call with an Emory-sponsored Zoom account and the call gets Zoombombed, please report the incident to the Emory Police Department by calling 404.727.6111 (TDD/TTY 404.320.1024) or by reporting the incident via LiveSafe.</p>\n<p>April 2, 2020 2:01 PM Change to S/U Option Emory College Students Today we are announcing changes to the S/U grading basis plan, which now includes an extended deadline and petition option.

We have been listening to the concerns that students have raised that S/U grades may put them in less competitive positions without a universal mandate. We especially appreciate the desire expressed in an on-line petition, and elsewhere, to protect the most vulnerable members of our student community. At the same time, we understand that many students want to pursue letter grades this semester. Please be assured that these issues are happening across higher education, and graduate and medical schools will all be aware of the extraordinary circumstances facing students in Spring 2020. In weighing the different grading possibilities for this semester, we have worked to understand and meet the different needs of our students as they seek to continue their academic careers during the distress of this global health crisis. There is no grading system that does not involve some tradeoff, and we recognize that no system will address all the concerns of all of our students. We know that this semester is an extraordinary one, and we want to assure everyone that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to help our students thrive during a challenging time. For questions or concerns about grading policies and practices, students should contact oue.advising@emory.edu</p>\n<p>Best wishes, Shari Obrentz, Associate Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Dan Dillard, Assistant Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Steve Savage, Associate Director of Communications, Office for Undergraduate Education</p>\n<p>March 30, 2020 5:00 PM Emory Together with Laney Alumni Graduate Students Dear Friends, Across our communities, at Emory, and in our homes with family and friends, we are all experiencing circumstances that we would never imagine. I want you to know that I am thinking of you and your loved ones and hope that you are safe and well. At the onset of the global public health crisis and continuing as long as it is needed, Emory is taking extraordinary steps to safeguard the health and well-being of the campus community. On March 23, the University transitioned to remote learning and remote work for our students, faculty, and staff. We will closely monitor and assess next steps as this situation continues to evolve. I am so very proud of how our students, faculty, and staff at Emory University and in Emory Healthcare are working together to address the needs of our communities. We need each other now more than ever. The impact of COVID-19 has created logistical and financial implications for many members of our communities. Emory is working to provide support in various ways and has launched the EmoryTogether Fund to assist with emergency needs. The added support of our alumni and donors will amplify efforts to provide funds for food, housing, health, travel, remote learning, family, and other COVID-19-related expenses. Here's how you can help. If you are able, please donate to the EmoryTogether Fund and join us in response to this pandemic. Alumni play an essential role in all that we do at Emory. We need your help now to ensure the continued progress and success of our students. We value your partnership and ask that you join with the Laney Graduate School to help students navigate these trying times with minimal disruption to their academic progress. Thank you again for your continued support of our students and the Laney Graduate School. Please stay safe and stay hopeful. With you, with great appreciation, -Lisa Lisa A.

As our community has shifted to distance learning and remote work in many areas, and the rate of cases in Georgia rapidly increases, it has become clear that it will be difficult for Emory to maintain an accurate count of members of our community who are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. For this reason, we have revised our approach to reporting confirmed cases and will no longer send announcements about illnesses on campus. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 in Georgia or Metro Atlanta, please refer to the Georgia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19 tracking. Our commitment to the health and safety of our community is unwavering as we continue to work closely with local and state health partners to monitor and manage COVID-19 and address its impact on our community. Leadership in Academic Affairs and Business Administration is currently working with schools and units to define essential activities on campus and provide guidance to both faculty and staff. We will focus our attention on around-the-clock actions to protect students, faculty, and staff who remain on campus. If your function is deemed essential and you are required to come to campus but feel you are in a high-risk group due to your age or a medical condition, please talk to your supervisor or HR representative for working options.

To best serve our students who requested to remain on campus this semester, and maintain important community bonds, we have brought students from our Oxford and Atlanta campuses together on Emory’s Clairmont campus, where we can provide each student residential single-room accommodations. Oxford students and their belongings were transported to their new accommodations by shuttles, which were staggered to support social distancing. Once settled, Oxford faculty and staff, along with Atlanta campus colleagues, will be available to continue to support all students remaining on campus throughout the semester. Our Oxford students traditionally transition to Atlanta after their sophomore year with strong bonds in place, ready to take on leadership positions at Emory University. These same students are being welcomed to their new homes earlier than anticipated on a campus that is eager for them to feel at home. Resources have been put in place to help them create a new kind of bond with their fellow students and professors at Emory College during this unprecedented time. Many thanks to our resilient Oxford College students for making this transition and also to the many dedicated staff members on both campuses who’ve helped support them throughout the move. We appreciate everyone’s patience as we continue to adapt to new challenges, and we wholeheartedly welcome Oxford to the Atlanta campus. In times of uncertainty, there is comfort in community. We’re grateful you are part of ours.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

From staff members who’ve helped Emory students move and kept a labyrinth of campus operations running smoothly to our remarkable, resilient faculty who’ve deftly transitioned to online learning platforms — and countless others — we thank you for your hard, ongoing work. Beginning this week, Emory Report is launching a series dedicated to shining a light on those critical efforts, exploring how our staff members are supporting the daily work of the university, laboring tirelessly behind the scenes to help advance our academic goals. We remain committed to supporting those members of our community who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. That extends to individuals who contribute to many facets of Emory’s operations and who are being significantly affected by changes brought by COVID-19. In recognition of those impacts, we have advocated on behalf of Bon Appetit workers to ensure they are protected from a sudden loss of earnings. Through this collaboration, the Bon Appetit employees who support both campuses will continue to receive their regular earnings and benefits through the end of the semester. Last week we announced a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund to support students. This week the Emory Together Fund was widened to cover faculty and staff experiencing direct challenges as a result of COVID-19. By helping meet their most pressing and immediate needs, the Emory Together Fund can give members of the Emory community the ability to overcome the difficult obstacles presented by COVID-19 and future emergencies. The Emory Together Fund includes a $50,000 matching challenge to encourage the Emory community to pitch in to help students, faculty, and staff address financial difficulties, like those presented by COVID-19. In the long-term, the Emory Together Fund will continue to provide financial resources to students, faculty, and staff of Emory University to overcome future challenges. More information, including an application form and guidelines for staff and faculty, is available on Emory’s Human Resources Emory Together Fund website. As we face the challenges of each new day, Emory will continue to honor our core values and mission, supporting our community and embracing our work with creativity, collaboration and commitment. Together, we are stronger.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Before providing some updates, I want to include a video Michael Elliott, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences filmed to communicate directly with you. If you are unable to view the video by clicking the image above, please view the video on youtube. Remote Teaching We began remote teaching this week. Your student will likely have attended their first online session. Our faculty are working hard to make this a great experience for your student. If your student has any issues with their course work, or connecting via remote technology, please ask them to reach out to their faculty members in the first instance. Course Grading Your student has received information on grading for this semester. We are offering students the option to change their grading basis from a letter grade to satisfactory/unsatisfactory, to petition for a late, single, course withdrawal without penalty or to request incomplete grades. Each option carries potential benefits and consequences and our advising team is available to meet virtually with students to discuss individual situations. We know that this is an unusual situation and we are working to offer practical solutions to the challenges we know that some students are facing. Commencement 2020 It is with great sorrow that the University has had to cancel our Commencement exercises in May 2020. I want to underscore that we are proud of all our graduating students and, as Dean Elliott noted in a message to them directly, will find a way to honor and celebrate all that they have accomplished at another time in the future. While those plans are still being formulated, we will keep your student updated. We look forward to celebrating them appropriately soon. As always, my team is available to answer any questions or concerns that you might have. You can reach them by emailing oue.advising@emory.edu Sincerely, Joanne Brzinski, Ph.D.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education</p>\n<p>Emory College of Arts and Sciences</p>\n<p>March 24, 2020 12:00 PM Support from Laney Edge and Professional Development &#x26; Career Planning Graduate Students Dear LGS Students, We hope that you are taking care of yourselves and remaining informed during this public health crisis.

That swift transition represents a cultural sea change from our normal academic routines and campus operations, and its success is due, in no small part, to each and every one of you. Congratulations on embracing the rapid changes necessary to keep our learning channels — and our community — strong, stable and functional. For some of us, learning and working online will be familiar. For others, it may represent a first-time experience. Together, we are making it work — every day, finding our way forward. And with each success, both large and small, our confidence and resolve is strengthened. We recognize that the rough edges of this transition have been smoothed by the dedication of many, many individuals, whose tireless, behind-the-scenes efforts have helped keep the very machinery of Emory humming. Our deepest thanks goes out to all Emory students, faculty and staff for the hard work, long hours and resilience you’ve demonstrated in going the extra mile to make this possible. It has been an extraordinary effort. As we continue adapting to change, an important reminder: For students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, starting this week all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. Amid these new developments, we also want to acknowledge important, long-standing traditions here at Emory. As we move together as a community through this spring semester — always a time of growth and renewal — we’re also preparing to welcome our newest cohort of student scholars, the Class of 2024. The evening of Wednesday, March 25, our final round of admitted first-year students will receive their eagerly awaited confirmation emails, inviting them to join the Emory community. It’s not hard for students to recall the anticipation you may have felt as a high school senior awaiting that notification as you decided where to enroll. We absolutely share in that excitement. We also want to recognize the important work being done by teams at the Office of Admission on the Atlanta campus and the Office of Enrollment Services on the Oxford campus to share admissions information with prospective Emory students. In the days ahead, those offices will continue working diligently to provide new remote opportunities for future Eagles to connect with current students, faculty, and staff. For the latest developments in our new normal together, we invite you to check out the recently relaunched Emory COVID-19 website, which now features information organized to provide quick answers for faculty, staff and students, including important resources for remote learning and working. Thank you for standing with Emory as we face our shared challenges — honoring the past, while building toward the future. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare</p>\n<p>March 23, 2020 1:09 PM LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis Graduate Students LGS Community, We write to follow up on the message from the Interim Provost Leadership Team to provide a process for requesting a change of grading basis from letter grade to S/U. We provide this added flexibility in recognition of the change to remote education, and your need to manage this in the context of broader efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. You can change the grading basis of one, some, or all of your courses, and you will have several weeks to make your decision. We encourage you to discuss this with your advisor, especially if you are considering this change for a required course. How to make a request: You can make requests now through April 10.</p>\n<p>Use this form: LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis to S/U. You will need to log in to the form using your Emory credentials.</p>\n<p>LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis to S/U. To help us process requests in a timely and accurate manner, follow the steps below to identify the classes that should be changed: Log in to your OPUS account, click “Course Planning and Enrollment,” and then “View My Classes.” That screen will have the information you need to provide in the form: (1) course subject and number, and (2) class and section number.

As we announced last week, the fund will help with the emergency financial needs of full and part-time degree-seeking students enrolled at Emory as of March 11, 2020, who demonstrate verifiable financial hardship related to COVID-19. Assistance may include help with a range of challenges associated with COVID-19, including basic needs (food, special housing circumstances, medicine, etc.), educational support needs (travel to a safe learning location, remote learning needs, etc.), and family/medical needs (job loss, medical deductible, etc.). Starting today, qualified students with direct COVID-19 related financial hardships are encouraged to apply for support through this fund, which will be available from March 23, 2020, through June 30, 2020. Applications should be submitted through the Finance website. Emory’s Division of Campus Life, working with an oversight committee, will review all applications in consideration of special requests. Emory employees, who are enrolled in degree programs, are not eligible for support through this fund but are encouraged to seek support through the Emory University Hardship Fund, which assists faculty and staff. A reminder for students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, beginning today, Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. To help everyone in the Emory community gain access to quick reliable information, we will relaunch the Emory COVID-19 website with specific areas for faculty, staff and students to obtain the necessary resources for remote learning/working, latest guidelines and campus operations. Lastly, everyone should be practicing social distancing whether you are remote or on campus. The global pandemic COVID-19 has presented many moments of uncertainty, and together, we are navigating unprecedented challenges. As students enter a new week at Emory, beginning our new phase of remote learning, know that faculty, staff and administrators are here to offer support. Despite the distances that physically divide us, we are fully committed to ensuring your success and maintaining our bond as an academic community. For Emory, and the nation, this is an historic moment — a time defined by our collective efforts to maintain our educational mission and momentum as we work to help mitigate a global pandemic. Those are remarkable, worthy goals, and we believe this community is up to the challenge. Together, we are moving forward as educational pioneers. Our thanks goes out to everyone — students, faculty, staff and administrators — for all that you are doing, every day, to make that possible. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 21, 2020 9:13 AM Emory’s Transition to Remote Learning Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community: On Monday, March 23, life at Emory University will begin to look different. The Emory community will advance into our new phase of remote learning and — for many staff members — working remotely. While that will necessarily bring changes, it won’t deter our mission to create and share knowledge, and it will not break our sense of community. While the changes we are experiencing may feel isolating and even overwhelming, in a remarkable way they have also brought us closer together, as we navigate this shared experience. And there are parts of the Emory experience that will not change. Emory faculty remain among the very best in their fields, with the resources and creativity to deliver an exceptional learning experience. Our talented staff remain dedicated to our mission and service to our students. And the resiliency of our student body is inspiring. Thank you to everyone for your contributions to our community. For everyone, confronting COVID-19 requires a big adjustment. But as you grapple with new challenges, please know that you are not alone — resources are available, along with people eager to help, even from afar. We encourage everyone to prioritize their mental health and wellbeing in the coming days and weeks. If you are on campus or if you are at home, the following resources are available to you: Students: Counseling and Psychological Services and Oxford Counseling and Career Services Staff: Working Through COVID-19 and FSAP. And each day, please take time for self-care. Get some fresh air, take a walk, get some exercise —all of which can be accomplished while maintaining social distancing. We are impressed with the many ways our students are maintaining relationships across the miles, and are hard at work to provide additional opportunities to connect and maintain the heart of Emory, even at a distance. For those students, staff and faculty who must remain on campus, we ask you to continue exercising care and compassion by practicing social distancing. That includes avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people and remaining six feet apart at all times. Under these federal recommendations, parties and large social gatherings are discouraged at this time. To support security and social distancing measures, Emory’s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have made adjustments to operating structures, which include campus building closures and reduced hours of operation and summer program cancellations: Atlanta and Oxford Campus Building Security and Access Beginning Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and will only be accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. While most faculty, staff and students have active Emory ID cards that will permit access to their buildings, we anticipate some may not. Those who lack required building access should coordinate access with your department and the EmoryCard office. Questions may be directed to: emorycard@emory.edu. Additional information about pop-up EmoryCard Office access will be provided in a separate communication. Atlanta Campus Closed or Reduced Hours of Operation Currently closed: Woodruff P.E. Center, Student Activity &#x26; Academic Center (excepting mail and dining), Emory Student Center, Alumni Memorial University Center, Schwartz Center for Performing Arts, Carlos Museum, Woodruff Library, Barnes &#x26; Noble</p>\n<p>Reduced hours: Dining hall hours will vary.

International Travel/Summer Study Abroad In keeping with the university’s indefinite suspension of international travel, Emory is canceling all Emory-sponsored undergraduate international travel for Summer 2020, including summer study abroad programs. Emory also encourages faculty and staff responsible for organizing any Summer 2020 Emory-sponsored international travel for graduate or professional students, either group or individual, to reconsider their plans, as such travel may not be allowed given the uncertain duration of the international travel suspension. This decision is being made in light of Emory’s international travel suspension and the possibility that planned summer travel could be disrupted by potential entry restrictions by the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, as Emory and its partners and colleagues abroad focus on their COVID-19 response, preparations that would normally be made to ensure safe and meaningful academic experiences abroad cannot be effectively executed. Students who have been planning Emory-sponsored travel should work with their units on any logistical or administrative issues resulting from this cancelation, such as the refund of paid deposits. Emory understands the importance of summer experiences abroad to students’ Emory program and remains committed to working with them to ensure academic continuity during this challenging time. As we continue to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic COVID-19 pandemic, we remain inspired and grateful for your help in facing change together. We encourage you to be patient next week with the faculty as we launch our courses remotely, with our staff as we implement new technology, and with each other as we find our new normal. The strength of our combined efforts today will go far in protecting the health and safety of everyone in the days to come. We can all play a role in helping turn the tide of this ongoing public health crisis. Thank you for doing your part. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 20, 2020 3:30 PM Oxford College: Getting Ready for Remote Learning Oxford College Students Dear Oxford College Students: As you prepare to transition to remote learning, Oxford College faculty and staff are doing the same. We have prepared FAQs to ready you for remote learning next week. You will certainly have many questions not addressed here. Your best source for up-to-date information from Emory University is our dedicated COVID-19 page. Please send specific questions about Oxford academics—classes, pre-registration, advising, and academic support—to the Oxford Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Please send general questions to OxfordDean@emory.edu for review and response. We are all finding new ways to help one another through these unprecedented times. Please know we are here to support you. Sincerely, Valerie Molyneaux</p>\n<p>Associate Dean for Academic Affairs</p>\n<p>Oxford College of Emory University 1. How do I resume class on Monday, March 23? Your faculty member for each individual class is scheduled to communicate with you by the end of the day on Thursday, March 19, 2020, about procedures for class. Some classes may be synchronous (real time as listed on OPUS, Eastern Standard Time). Others may be fully asynchronous (without real-time interaction). Some classes may have both synchronous and asynchronous elements. 2. What if I have not heard from my faculty member by the deadline? Please wait until the deadline has elapsed. Faculty may need every moment to prepare and communicate their plans for this major transition. After that, please contact Oxford College’s Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Valerie Molyneaux, for assistance (vmolyne@emory.edu). 3. How can I prepare for remote (online) learning? If you have not already done so, please complete the Oxford College remote learning survey. Oxford College Information Technology is using survey responses to support students who report access difficulties or barriers, so please complete the survey to allow us to support you through this period of remote learning. As possible, establish a secure internet connection. Gather trouble-shooting information, such as passwords and internet provider customer service contact information. Test your equipment, making sure that you can see and be seen through your camera, and hear and be heard through your speaker(s) and microphone. Zoom, Emory’s telecommunication platform, offers a test meeting site to check your equipment. Oxford also has resources and support for remote learning. Remote (online) learning will present new challenges. Daily log-ins to Canvas, even for asynchronous courses; close and careful reading of class communications (ideally on a computer screen, not just a phone); a regular study routine (ideally in a distraction-free space reserved for study); and connecting virtually with faculty and classmates can all help. 4. Can I use Oxford/Emory library materials? Access to Emory University databases, eJournals, and our large collection of digital books and reference tools will continue to be available online. Please see the Remote Library Resources and Services Guide for details about accessing these resources. Contact the Oxford Library at 770.784.8380, through email at ox-librarystaff@listserv.cc.emory.edu, or through the chat widget on the Oxford Library homepage. Please watch EaglePost for an announcement from your Oxford College Library about expanded access to online textbook/ course materials from select publishers. 5. How will I register for fall classes? Due to extended Spring Break, the timeline for Fall 2020 pre-registration has delayed one week. Official enrollment appointments will be updated by Wednesday, March 18 in OPUS. If you have questions about enrollment or registration, please contact the Advising Support Center (oxadvising@emory.edu). As of Tuesday, March 17, 2020, no changes or decisions have yet been announced regarding whether summer and future semesters will be offered remotely or in person. At this time, we are planning for regular operations; all updates will be communicated to students, faculty, and staff by the Office of the Provost. 6. How will I participate in academic advising? Rising second-year students (Oxford Class of 2021): work directly with your faculty advisor. If you have not heard from your advisor by March 27, 2020, please contact the Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Rising juniors/ graduating sophomores (Oxford Class of 2020): you have several advising options. Students who have declared a major in Emory College may receive separate communications from major departments. All Oxford students continuing to Emory College have a professional advisor in the Office for Undergraduate Education (Emory College’s equivalent to Oxford’s ASC); click here to find your advisor. Students continuing to the Goizueta Business School and School of Nursing, you will hear directly from the BBA and BSN programs about advising and registration procedures. Oxford faculty advisors and the ASC are always available to give general advice to rising juniors/ graduating sophomores as well. 7. Will I stay on track to graduate? Students will be provided equivalent opportunities to complete their current spring semester classes that they would have had during residential learning. 8. What happens to the accommodations I have on file through the Department of Accessibility Services? While the structure of an online course may eliminate the need for many typical classroom accommodations, the environment may also create a unique set of needed accommodations. Communicate with your faculty as soon as possible to understand how the change of instruction may affect your accommodations. Visit Accommodate for more information. The Department of Accessibility Services will remain open Monday-Friday, 8am – 5pm, EST. All student appointments will be conducted via phone or virtually until further notice. DAS will not proctor exams while remote instruction is in place. If you have any questions or concerns, please email the Oxford office: oas_oxford@emory.edu. 9. Is academic support still available? Yes, remotely! Please see details below. Writing Center The Writing Center will be open for individual online consultations from 2PM to 10PM EST, Sundays through Thursdays through the end of the semester. Consultations will take place through Google docs and Zoom. To make an appointment, visit oxford.mywconline.com. Some last-minute drop-in hours may be available, so reserving an appointment in advance is the best way to ensure that you get the time that you want.

As each day brings new challenges, we want to help students feel confident about maintaining their academic progress. We also recognize a hard truth: Emory undergraduate, graduate and professional students of various income levels and backgrounds may incur financial hardships as a result of COVID-19. In order to respond to these emerging needs and offer support to our students in crisis, Emory has established a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund which will be managed by Campus Life. More information about this new fund — and application guidelines — is anticipated to be released on Monday, March 23, 2020. In addition, students may request the option of satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading in place of a letter grade for a course or courses taken during the Spring 2020 term. Faculty members may also request that a graded course be changed to satisfactory/unsatisfactory based on changes related to the move to remote learning. Schools and colleges will review these requests and respond to them through school-based governance policies and committees, and additional information will be provided to you soon by your school. As always, we appreciate the flexibility and willingness to embrace these grading modifications that have been demonstrated by our faculty and students. As we move forward together in adapting to new learning styles, know that Emory will continue to seek ways to best support our community. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare</p>\n<p>March 18, 2020 6:06 PM Message from Dean Michael Elliott Emory College Students Message from Dean Michael Elliott I wanted to communicate with you directly about a few things that I am feeling and thinking as we approach the \"new normal\" of remote teaching.

It is with great sadness that I write to let you know we have made the difficult, but absolutely necessary decision, to cancel our traditional May commencement activities. However, I also want to share with you that planning already is underway to celebrate and commemorate the Class of 2020 as we are living in an extraordinary time. We did not make this decision lightly. I recognize that it will cause disappointment, especially for our graduates and their loved ones. But cancellation of the on-campus activities is, at present, the one option that ensures the safety and well-being of our Emory community members. We must be proactive in our mitigation efforts against COVID-19. Nevertheless, I apologize that we will not have our regular graduation celebrations, and wanted to let you know as soon as possible to help you with your plans. Thankfully, cancellation will not be the last word. Together, we will recognize all that you have accomplished and celebrate your creativity, resilience, and resolve. I wish you great success as you move forward into the next phase of your lives. I appreciate your patience and continued understanding as we navigate these challenges. Most of all, I encourage each member of the Emory community to continue to care for yourselves and your families during these very stressful times. We will remain guided by our mission of putting knowledge to work in the service of all humanity. The present times call for compassion and for courage. With gratitude, Claire E. Sterk</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 4:00 PM Guidance for LGS Student Research &#x26; Academic Progress Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Dear LGS Community, As you are aware, Emory University is taking extraordinary steps to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. I write to provide guidance on what this means for LGS. All LGS students should begin working remotely immediately, to the fullest extent possible, with transitions completed no later than Friday, March 20, 2020. Faculty advisors should work with their graduate students to develop individualized plans to continue their research remotely. All LGS students who currently receive stipends, including those supported by research grants, will continue to receive their stipends. LGS students should not be assigned as essential lab personnel with on-campus responsibilities. No student may be compelled to come to campus for any purpose.Faculty must be flexible to support remote work arrangements for LGS students. In the event that a laboratory engaged in essential research activities requires an LGS student to maintain a physical presence in the lab, this must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director, the PI’s Department Chair, and the Dean of the Laney Graduate School. The resulting decision will be reported to the PI’s School/Unit Dean. LGS will provide additional guidance and update the FAQs on the LGS COVID-19 webpage. LGS will work closely with graduate programs to mitigate the impact on student academic progress in order to meet the academic needs of each student. We recognize that transitioning certain kinds of research activities to remote work will require careful planning and may affect academic progress. We will provide further guidance as the implications for the research environment continue to unfold. If you have questions or concerns about academic progress, please reach out to your Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director. Students outside of lab environments should contact Interim Assistant Dean Mackenzie Bristow. Students in lab environments should contact Associate Dean Amanda Marie James. Directors of Graduate Studies/Program Directors should contact Senior Associate Dean Cathryn Johnson. During these rapidly evolving circumstances, we must work together and stay connected to protect our community. We appreciate your partnership and efforts to keep our community safe. Please regularly check the Emory University and LGS COVID-19 webpages for more information. Stay strong and resolute in your practices to curtail and stop transmission. Be patient and responsibly flexible and take time for self-care.</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 11:14 AM Emory’s Commitment to our Community Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, To strengthen our investment of support for students, faculty and staff during a time of unprecedented disruption, Emory leadership will provide a series of financial initiatives, which are as follows: Refund of Unused Fee Emory will refund student accounts with a calculated amount of unused housing, dining, athletic fees, activity fees, parking fees, and other fees unrelated to academic instruction. Since instruction will continue, no instructional costs will be reimbursed (tuition, technology fees, etc.) Other services that will remain available to students, such as health related fees, will also not be refunded. Federal Work Study Income Replacement The Department of Education has authorized the payment of unutilized Federal Work Study funds to each impacted student. The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) has reviewed the funds available and is in the process of calculating the amount eligible under this program, to be awarded to eligible students in the next week. High Financial Need Student Support Stipend We understand that Emory undergraduate students with the highest financial need will experience the greatest impact associated with the expedited closure of the resident halls and shift in academic delivery. With that in mind, Emory will provide an immediate “Student Support Stipend” to eligible undergraduate students in the amount of $1,000 within the next week. Students will be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid. Student Employee Salary Replacement Emory students of various income levels and backgrounds hold jobs at Emory and are classified as student employees. These jobs may be administrative, research focused, athletic support or various other activities. The rate of pay is different for each student employee and the hours may vary by job as well as by week-to-week availability, depending upon the student’s academic load and the unit’s need. We are concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the financial well-being of these students who depend on this income in their financial planning. As a means of supporting our student employees as the university moves to remote work and students are leaving campus, we propose to pay estimated earnings for the remaining weeks of the term based on their historical time worked. Students may check with their hiring unit to see if it is possible to continue to work remotely and may be paid for that time as well. Emory Employees Pay and Compensation We are making the commitment that regular faculty and staff employed by Emory University will be paid as usual for the current anticipated duration of the social distancing protocols, no matter their role within Emory and the altered learning/working environment. The process and details are still in development, but we are committed to continuation of pay from Emory during this time of uncertainty. Emory’s administration is committed to our students’ health and well-being, and we are dedicated to supporting their educational journeys with creativity and innovation as they progress along chosen academic pathways. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 16, 2020 7:20 PM Emory Update and Resources Especially for You Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students Dear Parents and Families, Here at Emory, students have always been our most important priority. And so it is natural that we share your deepest concerns for their success and wellbeing. Amid these uncertain times, that’s one reason we are committed to open communication that provides accurate, up-to-date information. A few days ago, we notified the Emory community that two undergraduate students staying at Dobbs Hall and the Clairmont campus were being tested for possible COVID-19. While awaiting test results, the students self-isolated in off-campus housing provided by the university. Today, we can report that both students have tested negative; they will remain in off-campus housing until other arrangements can be made. A third Emory student who lives off campus was tested for possible COVID-19, and has also tested negative. On March 16, two undergraduate students residing at Emory Point tested positive for COVID-19. Both students are in satisfactory condition and are self-isolating in their off-campus apartment. The students, who had left campus for spring break, have not been on the Emory University campus for more than a week; they did not report feeling ill until they returned from the break. Please be assured that Emory’s student health services and other environmental safety personnel interview all individuals within the campus community who test positive for COVID-19. Those interviews not only determine a patient’s contacts and activities, they help guide the university in taking action to safeguard the community’s health. Emory will update the public on COVID-19-specific updates and information via the Emory COVID-19 website, “Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community.” When the spread of COVID-19 was first reported in the U.S., Emory increased the frequency and intensity of its cleaning regime in all areas of the university, focusing on commons areas such as bathrooms, dining facilities and meeting rooms. If students or other members of the university community are tested for COVID-19 –– as with our two undergraduate students who were tested on March 14 — their rooms and workspaces will be cleaned and disinfected as detailed above. We have been advising students to leave campus and, if possible, return to their homes. We understand that it is not possible for all, so Emory is prepared to provide support to those who are unable to relocate and have been granted an exemption. All other students must move out of the residence halls by March 22 at 5 p.m. If you are concerned about traveling to campus to help your student move out, please know that the university can pack and ship belongings or store them locally for your student. We can also make arrangements for you and your student to move out during non-peak hours. For those students who cannot leave campus, Student Health Services will remain open. At this time, our care model will be a hybrid of virtual assessment and in-person visits. In order to manage the volume and protect the health of our patients and caregivers, Student Health Services will identify via phone the best course to seek treatment for those who feel unwell. Students with urgent concerns should call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 or Oxford Student Health Services at 770-784-8376. In the event of severe symptoms, including shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or chest pain, they should call 911 directly. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are working to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to partner closely with local and state agencies to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19.

We thank you for your patience as we continue to navigate this evolving situation. There are a lot of factors at play and we are working to resolve concerns as they arise. In this email we will begin to answer several questions that have been raised in regard to your academics directly with us or through your representatives on College Council.</p>\n<p>Fall 2020 Pre-Registration Pre-Registration will be delayed one week for all undergraduate schools. The new schedule is attached, and we have adjusted your registration appointments accordingly. Appointment times will remain the same, only the date has been amended. These times, which are all in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), should be viewable in OPUS now.</p>\n<p>If you have an advising appointment with a faculty member this week, please confirm with them if this will go ahead or if they would like to postpone your appointment. Faculty are working hard on revising course syllabi so please be flexible. Class Management &#x26; Faculty Expectations Individual instructors will provide you with exact details on course arrangements no later than 5 p.m. EDT on Thursday, March 19. We want to be clear with you regarding teaching expectations from the administration: Synchronous classes will meet at their regularly scheduled time, just in a remote format.</p>\n<p>Some course content may be delivered in an asynchronous format, or a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions. Each delivery method offers different learning opportunities for students that the other method could not provide. Students should expect that faculty will offer this combination.</p>\n<p>Faculty are expected to continue offering regular instruction, assessment and feedback throughout the duration of the semester.</p>\n<p>Faculty are expected to offer office hours through a virtual platform. You should confirm the times/availability of these directly with your faculty.</p>\n<p>Experiential Courses (labs, research, performance courses, internships, etc.) are under review. While you will be unable to continue these courses on campus, your instructors/coordinators are working hard to translate these into a suitable remote format. Some instructors have already provided information about alternative activities; others are working to develop options. More information will be provided as it becomes available. If any of the arrangements communicated by your instructors pose significant difficulties to you (e.g. time differences, lack of reliable internet), please reach out to them and explain your concerns. Faculty are prepared to work with you as best as they can.

Here is our pledge: As Emory enters this next chapter, we will strive to stay connected, maintaining our essential bond. Even though our community may not be together physically for an unforeseen time, we are committed to moving forward together, united in spirit and service and preserving the care and compassion that have long been a hallmark of this university. That is foundational to who we are as a community, and it will not change. Over the past 24 hours, we’ve understandably received many questions — concerns about housing, remote learning and working, and especially how to best help the Emory community, particularly our students. Many answers to those questions will be updated daily at Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, a website dedicated to our response to COVID-19. It is heartening to be joined by the broader Emory community in our commitment to serving our students. In fact, it’s been moving to see just how quickly support can coalesce. Even as students began packing to leave campus, the Emory Student Government Association was distributing free MARTA passes to help with transportation. We’ve seen staff members working long hours to assist students with specific needs, faculty rapidly developing online lesson plans, and caring alumni who’ve stepped forward to volunteer their help. That outpouring of support has been heartwarming and, of course, not unexpected. For those who are able and eager to help, please consider contributing to the student hardship fund . In addition, the faculty and staff hardship fund offers assistance to other members of our campus community who might be impacted by COVID-19. Moving forward, perhaps one of the most important things we can all do is stay strong and healthy for each other — for our communities, our families and our friends. Let’s work to preserve those connections, our fundamental human bonds. Amid these remarkable times, let us prove what a community can be. Together, we will be stronger for it.</p>\n<p>In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare</p>\n<p>March 14, 2020 9:30 PM Two Emory Undergraduates Tested for Possible COVID-19 Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff, Healthcare Staff Dear Emory Community, In any public health crisis, it is imperative that information be shared immediately with community members while protecting patient privacy. With that in mind, we wanted to notify our community that two Emory University students in undergraduate housing are being tested for possible COVID-19. Neither case has been confirmed but, out of an abundance of caution, both students are self-isolating in off-campus housing provided by the university. The Emory community will be notified if one or both students test positive. The undergraduates live in Dobbs Hall and at the Clairmont Campus, respectively. Their roommates have been notified and are being supported by student health services staff. The students’ rooms have been cleaned and disinfected by Emory Environmental Health and Safety personnel. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are taking action around-the-clock to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to work closely with local and state partners to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19. We understand that the uncertainty and quickly changing dynamic around COVID-19 can bring stress and anxiety. Emory is committed to keeping our community informed and to provide as many resources as possible. Many of these resources and key updates can be found at Emory’s COVID-19 website. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases in Georgia and across the country, students should self-assess for fever or cough. Students who develop symptoms need to separate themselves from others and call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 (Clifton Rd. campus), or Oxford College Student Services at 770-784-8376.

We are all disappointed about the need to transition to remote learning and, for many employees, remote working. But we are all dedicated to making the changes necessary to keep each other safe as we continue with the vital mission of the university “to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity,” which is needed now more than ever. Already, you are showing the strength and service that defines the Emory community. Students are reaching out to support each other. Faculty are coming together to adapt their courses for remote learning and plan how they will continue their research. At every level of the university, staff members are going the extra mile to make sure that everyone receives the information and resources they need for our community to continue to thrive even in the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Some of you may be frustrated or anxious in the face of these unprecedented circumstances for you, your family, the university and our broader community. Please know that we are working to answer your questions as quickly and thoroughly as possible in a rapidly evolving situation. Please visit our dedicated website, Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, daily for newly updated information and answers to common questions on topics ranging from health and support resources to classes, housing, travel, events, finances and other logistics as we all make this transition together. Please note especially the information on travel and events. In the coming days, we know that the Emory community will remain strong and connected by our common purpose, even if we are no longer together in person on our campuses. Beyond your courses or work assignments, continue to reach out to each other by phone or video to sustain our networks of care and compassion. And as you support each other, know that we are here to support you as well. In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Emory has now indefinitely suspended all official and previously authorized international travel and is strongly urging our campus community to postpone all university-sponsored domestic travel. Please view Emory’s latest travel restrictions here. We are continuing to monitor the situation and observe all guidance from Emory related to the Coronavirus. We will reopen the program when University directives advise that it is safe to do so. We do not know when that will be. Please continue to collect the necessary materials to apply for PDS funds once the program reopens. We intend to provide enhanced access to PDS funds at that time. During the PDS program suspension period, we will adjust the window for submitting follow-up documentation and reports. For trips/projects that have occurred during February and March 2020, you will now have up to 60 days from the end date to submit these items. Like many other disruptions related to the Coronavirus, this guidance may interfere with your professional plans in the coming months. We are very grateful for your patience and understanding. If you have any specific questions, please direct them to lgs.profdev@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 13, 2020 10:15 AM Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Extended Spring Break As a reminder, Emory University will extend spring break for students until Sunday, March 22, 2020. During this time, no in-person or remote classes should take place. The University will transition to remote learning beginning Monday, March 23. Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Qualifying examinations and thesis and dissertation defenses may take place on campus as scheduled. However, meetings should limit in-person participation to committee members only and options for remote participation must be offered. If desired, public participation may be arranged via remote connection. We strongly advise meeting participants who are considered at higher risk to participate remotely. Please consider social distancing and respiratory hygiene best practices for all meetings. For the remainder of the term, approval forms should be submitted electronically and include scanned signatures. Emory Zoom is recommended and useful for the practices above. Emory’s Teaching and Learning Technologies provides workshops, practice sessions, and instruction videos. Please submit any questions about defenses and exams to Ulf Nilsson at unilsso@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 12, 2020 1:00 PM Oxford Housing Move Out/Stay Request Form Oxford College Students Hello Oxford College Students, This communication is an outline to help you with planning next steps as a result of Emory University’s response to COVID-19.

Subject: Emory discontinuing on-site study abroad programs Dear study abroad students, In our email to you yesterday, we offered all study abroad students the option to return home and continue their studies remotely as programs permit. Since then, President Trump announced that most travel from Europe to the U.S. will be restricted for 30 days, and Emory University has decided to extend spring break and move to remote learning. We are reaching out to follow-up on our previous email amid the changing international landscape. As these changes highlight, international travel is growing increasingly inaccessible. Emory University is discontinuing all on-site study abroad programs. At this time, we are directing all study abroad students to return home and continue their studies remotely. We remain committed to working with you directly to determine the best method to maintain academic continuity. In most cases, this will mean completing online coursework provided by your current program or university abroad. If an online option is not available, we will work with you to make a contingency plan. These changes will obviously disrupt your semester plans. We ask that you be patient as we work with you to find an individualized solution for the remainder of your semester. Every student will have unique circumstances to consider when making plans to return home. Students who are not U.S. citizens, have underlying medical conditions, or have other extenuating circumstances should move quickly to make travel plans. If you are a non-U.S. citizen, you should arrange to travel immediately to a location that is suitab</p>","id":"d90d0924-fd3e-55e3-b3f1-f40c39c20146","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-emory/2020-04-08-23_25_46/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Emory-Wide Remote Learning for Students"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>April 8, 2020 10:59 AM Emory Mental and Emotional Support Resources Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, By now, we’ve all experienced what it feels like to teach, learn and work remotely during a global pandemic. And what a sweeping transition it has been — from adjusting to new virtual classroom experiences to expanded responsibilities at home, balancing work with the challenges of homeschooling our children or caring for loved ones as we shelter in place. While these changes are necessary to fight COVID-19, they aren’t always easy. Social isolation and physical distancing is hard. Working long hours amid looming economic uncertainties is trying. Being forced to abruptly develop a new way of teaching and learning mid-semester has been a challenge. Please know that you are not alone. At Emory, we recognize the many adjustments you face and feel the stress of those changes, too. We also have the resources and ability to help, even in this new age of physical distancing. Undergraduate and graduate students should know that Emory’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is offering telehealth clinical services, where you can speak with a counselor or talk with a member of a triage team who can make assessments and help guide next steps. CAPS is also offering virtual workshops at 2 p.m. on Friday afternoons via Zoom to help manage stress, anxiety and feelings of social isolation. In addition, a series of peer-led virtual discussion groups begins April 13 to address academics, concerns about the future, home life and feelings of loneliness. Learn more about CAPS services during COVID-19. Student Health Services is offering telehealth appointments for both COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 related health questions. To learn more, please visit Campus Life. For faculty and staff who may need emotional support, the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) offers free and confidential services to help promote emotional, behavioral and organizational health. To support the increasing needs of our faculty, staff, physicians, trainees and their families throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, FSAP now offers tele-mental health services through telephonic and video-conferencing sessions and consultations. Videoconferencing services are conducted through a HIPAA-compliant Zoom platform. To learn more about the emotional support services offered by FSAP or to find help for you or a family member, please contact FSAP at 404-727-WELL (9355), efsap@emory.edu, or www.fsap.emory.edu. FSAP also offers a range of educational webinars and group support sessions focused on leadership and team services, addressing topics that range from stress management strategies and tips for healthy remote working to resilience and conflict management coaching. For more information about working through the COVID-19 pandemic, Emory Human Resources has launched a dedicated website offering guidance, support and tips for the unique challenges we now face, whether it’s balancing work and family life, learning how to work remotely, taking care of ourselves, or figuring out how to get bills paid. Usha Rackliffe, associate professor of practice at Emory’s Goizueta Business School, consolidated publicly available resources that we have added to the COVID-19 site to help students, faculty and staff access information and resources, including information on mortgage payments, student loans, rent, taxes and credit cards to help our community get the help that we need during this unprecedented time. Knowing where to find reliable, accessible support along the way can help in managing challenging times, and we encourage you to explore and take advantage of the resources available to you. Throughout the journey, Emory stands with you.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Care and compassion are essential to our mission of education and service. These values have proven crucial in guiding our response to the coronavirus pandemic. Emory has long strived to create a community of belonging. Within that charge, we recognize the importance of standing together during difficult times to support and encourage one another. Across the nation and the world, however, fears over COVID-19 have sometimes erupted into anger and accusations, racism and xenophobia. Globally, reports of anti-Asian bias and blatant harassment have been on the increase. Sadly, these behaviors have even been directed at frontline health care workers in hospitals throughout the U.S. as they work to treat patients, save lives and serve the public — all under incredibly stressful conditions. And our students, while pursuing their education and resuming their lives, have not been spared from the hate. As we find our way forward, let us not forget our essential Emory values. Mean-spirited, untruthful, socially stigmatizing remarks, slurs and actions do not represent who we are as a community. In fact, they stand in direct opposition to our most foundational principles. Simply put, there is no room for hate at Emory. Please know that bias and harassment within our community will not be tolerated. Indeed, harassment of any person or group of persons on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap or veteran’s status is a form of discrimination specifically prohibited by university policy. If members of the Emory community encounter such behaviors, on or off campus, we want to hear from you. For more information and support, please contact the Emory University Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at 404-727-9867 or oei@emory.edu. We recognize that harassment takes many forms. Some members of the Emory community have recently reported encountering incidents of “Zoombombing” — instances of uninvited guests crashing online Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars in order to shout slurs and share offensive materials. While Zoom has options to combat such intrusions, Emory’s Library and Information Technology Services (LITS) team recommends that those concerned with unwanted intrusions should require meeting passwords or, for smaller meetings, use a “waiting room.” For step-by-step guidance, please visit here. Additional questions may be directed to videoservices@emory.edu. Spreading inaccurate information can too easily lead to scapegoating and other forms of disrespect, particularly aimed at persons of Asian descent. During this challenging time, we also urge members of the Emory community to seek out factual information, consulting official and evidence-based sources. For accurate information and updates on how the coronavirus is impacting Emory, please visit COVID-19 updates. At Emory, we all have a role in building our community of belonging aided by members who are respectful of one another and find value in the richness and complexity of our shared diversity. Our inability to be physically present with one another offers an opportunity for us to demonstrate support for each other and to form an even deeper connection to our core values. Now more than ever, let us celebrate our Emory values and strengthen our fundamental bond, affirming the dignity and humanity of each other through our words and actions. Though apart, we remain, as always, in community.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Tips for preventing Zoombombing To avoid having your Zoom meetings interrupted, take the following precautions: Do not share Zoom links on social media or external facing websites; only communicate your Zoom links through email or other secure means.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, add a Password, which you would then communicate to your participants. They will be prompted to enter the password any time they attempt to enter the meeting room.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, enable a Waiting Room. This means you have to manually allow in any of your participants. Be sure to keep an eye on the waiting room, and click “admit” in the participant window to allow people in. Encouraging participants to enter the room with their full name will help you keep track of them. If you have a second meeting leader, this is a great job for them, so that you can lead the meeting and someone else can manage the participant list.</p>\n<p>While in the room, you can also limit the screen sharing capacity just to the host. This will not work if your participants need to share their screens, but if they do not, follow these steps to limit the sharing. Be sure to take the time to familiarize yourself with Zoom’s settings and features so you understand how to protect your virtual space when you need to. Resources LITS has tips and advice on Zoom settings to avoid Zoombombing.</p>\n<p>The Emory Police Department also has some helpful tips. What to do if you experience Zoombombing If you are hosting a Zoom call with an Emory-sponsored Zoom account and the call gets Zoombombed, please report the incident to the Emory Police Department by calling 404.727.6111 (TDD/TTY 404.320.1024) or by reporting the incident via LiveSafe.</p>\n<p>April 2, 2020 2:01 PM Change to S/U Option Emory College Students Today we are announcing changes to the S/U grading basis plan, which now includes an extended deadline and petition option. We want to share more information on how these changes will affect Emory College students specifically. Changes to S/U Grading Option We will extend the current S/U change deadline until April 27 (the last day of class for this semester).</p>\n<p>the current S/U change deadline until (the last day of class for this semester). After April 27, students will have the option to submit a petition to request a change from a letter grade to S/U basis.

Students must submit their petition for consideration by the following deadline: Graduating Seniors – May 11 All other students – May 18</p>\n<p>Spring 2020 Study Abroad students who are considering changes to the grading basis of their courses must contact their Study Abroad Advisor in order to make any changes. They cannot make changes in OPUS. Other Academic Options There have been no other changes to the academic options available to you. Withdrawal Petition is available until April 10</p>\n<p>Extended Withdrawal Deadline (for First-Year, Oxford and Transfer students) is April 3</p>\n<p>Incompletes may be requested in discussion with your academic advisor through April 27. We have been listening to the concerns that students have raised that S/U grades may put them in less competitive positions without a universal mandate. We especially appreciate the desire expressed in an on-line petition, and elsewhere, to protect the most vulnerable members of our student community. At the same time, we understand that many students want to pursue letter grades this semester. Please be assured that these issues are happening across higher education, and graduate and medical schools will all be aware of the extraordinary circumstances facing students in Spring 2020. In weighing the different grading possibilities for this semester, we have worked to understand and meet the different needs of our students as they seek to continue their academic careers during the distress of this global health crisis. There is no grading system that does not involve some tradeoff, and we recognize that no system will address all the concerns of all of our students. We know that this semester is an extraordinary one, and we want to assure everyone that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to help our students thrive during a challenging time. For questions or concerns about grading policies and practices, students should contact oue.advising@emory.edu</p>\n<p>Best wishes, Shari Obrentz, Associate Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Dan Dillard, Assistant Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Steve Savage, Associate Director of Communications, Office for Undergraduate Education</p>\n<p>March 30, 2020 5:00 PM Emory Together with Laney Alumni Graduate Students Dear Friends, Across our communities, at Emory, and in our homes with family and friends, we are all experiencing circumstances that we would never imagine. I want you to know that I am thinking of you and your loved ones and hope that you are safe and well. At the onset of the global public health crisis and continuing as long as it is needed, Emory is taking extraordinary steps to safeguard the health and well-being of the campus community. On March 23, the University transitioned to remote learning and remote work for our students, faculty, and staff. We will closely monitor and assess next steps as this situation continues to evolve. I am so very proud of how our students, faculty, and staff at Emory University and in Emory Healthcare are working together to address the needs of our communities. We need each other now more than ever. The impact of COVID-19 has created logistical and financial implications for many members of our communities. Emory is working to provide support in various ways and has launched the EmoryTogether Fund to assist with emergency needs. The added support of our alumni and donors will amplify efforts to provide funds for food, housing, health, travel, remote learning, family, and other COVID-19-related expenses. Here's how you can help. If you are able, please donate to the EmoryTogether Fund and join us in response to this pandemic. Alumni play an essential role in all that we do at Emory. We need your help now to ensure the continued progress and success of our students. We value your partnership and ask that you join with the Laney Graduate School to help students navigate these trying times with minimal disruption to their academic progress. Thank you again for your continued support of our students and the Laney Graduate School. Please stay safe and stay hopeful. With you, with great appreciation, -Lisa Lisa A.

As our community has shifted to distance learning and remote work in many areas, and the rate of cases in Georgia rapidly increases, it has become clear that it will be difficult for Emory to maintain an accurate count of members of our community who are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. For this reason, we have revised our approach to reporting confirmed cases and will no longer send announcements about illnesses on campus. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 in Georgia or Metro Atlanta, please refer to the Georgia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19 tracking. Our commitment to the health and safety of our community is unwavering as we continue to work closely with local and state health partners to monitor and manage COVID-19 and address its impact on our community. Leadership in Academic Affairs and Business Administration is currently working with schools and units to define essential activities on campus and provide guidance to both faculty and staff. We will focus our attention on around-the-clock actions to protect students, faculty, and staff who remain on campus. If your function is deemed essential and you are required to come to campus but feel you are in a high-risk group due to your age or a medical condition, please talk to your supervisor or HR representative for working options. In the event of illness If you are a student who has relocated out of Atlanta , and have become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat), call your primary care provider.</p>\n<p>, and have become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat), call your primary care provider.

To best serve our students who requested to remain on campus this semester, and maintain important community bonds, we have brought students from our Oxford and Atlanta campuses together on Emory’s Clairmont campus, where we can provide each student residential single-room accommodations. Oxford students and their belongings were transported to their new accommodations by shuttles, which were staggered to support social distancing. Once settled, Oxford faculty and staff, along with Atlanta campus colleagues, will be available to continue to support all students remaining on campus throughout the semester. Our Oxford students traditionally transition to Atlanta after their sophomore year with strong bonds in place, ready to take on leadership positions at Emory University. These same students are being welcomed to their new homes earlier than anticipated on a campus that is eager for them to feel at home. Resources have been put in place to help them create a new kind of bond with their fellow students and professors at Emory College during this unprecedented time. Many thanks to our resilient Oxford College students for making this transition and also to the many dedicated staff members on both campuses who’ve helped support them throughout the move. We appreciate everyone’s patience as we continue to adapt to new challenges, and we wholeheartedly welcome Oxford to the Atlanta campus. In times of uncertainty, there is comfort in community. We’re grateful you are part of ours.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

From staff members who’ve helped Emory students move and kept a labyrinth of campus operations running smoothly to our remarkable, resilient faculty who’ve deftly transitioned to online learning platforms — and countless others — we thank you for your hard, ongoing work. Beginning this week, Emory Report is launching a series dedicated to shining a light on those critical efforts, exploring how our staff members are supporting the daily work of the university, laboring tirelessly behind the scenes to help advance our academic goals. We remain committed to supporting those members of our community who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. That extends to individuals who contribute to many facets of Emory’s operations and who are being significantly affected by changes brought by COVID-19. In recognition of those impacts, we have advocated on behalf of Bon Appetit workers to ensure they are protected from a sudden loss of earnings. Through this collaboration, the Bon Appetit employees who support both campuses will continue to receive their regular earnings and benefits through the end of the semester. Last week we announced a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund to support students. This week the Emory Together Fund was widened to cover faculty and staff experiencing direct challenges as a result of COVID-19. By helping meet their most pressing and immediate needs, the Emory Together Fund can give members of the Emory community the ability to overcome the difficult obstacles presented by COVID-19 and future emergencies. The Emory Together Fund includes a $50,000 matching challenge to encourage the Emory community to pitch in to help students, faculty, and staff address financial difficulties, like those presented by COVID-19. In the long-term, the Emory Together Fund will continue to provide financial resources to students, faculty, and staff of Emory University to overcome future challenges. More information, including an application form and guidelines for staff and faculty, is available on Emory’s Human Resources Emory Together Fund website. As we face the challenges of each new day, Emory will continue to honor our core values and mission, supporting our community and embracing our work with creativity, collaboration and commitment. Together, we are stronger.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Your student will likely have attended their first online session. Our faculty are working hard to make this a great experience for your student. If your student has any issues with their course work, or connecting via remote technology, please ask them to reach out to their faculty members in the first instance. Course Grading Your student has received information on grading for this semester. We are offering students the option to change their grading basis from a letter grade to satisfactory/unsatisfactory, to petition for a late, single, course withdrawal without penalty or to request incomplete grades. Each option carries potential benefits and consequences and our advising team is available to meet virtually with students to discuss individual situations. We know that this is an unusual situation and we are working to offer practical solutions to the challenges we know that some students are facing. Commencement 2020 It is with great sorrow that the University has had to cancel our Commencement exercises in May 2020. I want to underscore that we are proud of all our graduating students and, as Dean Elliott noted in a message to them directly, will find a way to honor and celebrate all that they have accomplished at another time in the future. While those plans are still being formulated, we will keep your student updated. We look forward to celebrating them appropriately soon.

That swift transition represents a cultural sea change from our normal academic routines and campus operations, and its success is due, in no small part, to each and every one of you. Congratulations on embracing the rapid changes necessary to keep our learning channels — and our community — strong, stable and functional. For some of us, learning and working online will be familiar. For others, it may represent a first-time experience. Together, we are making it work — every day, finding our way forward. And with each success, both large and small, our confidence and resolve is strengthened. We recognize that the rough edges of this transition have been smoothed by the dedication of many, many individuals, whose tireless, behind-the-scenes efforts have helped keep the very machinery of Emory humming. Our deepest thanks goes out to all Emory students, faculty and staff for the hard work, long hours and resilience you’ve demonstrated in going the extra mile to make this possible. It has been an extraordinary effort. As we continue adapting to change, an important reminder: For students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, starting this week all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. Amid these new developments, we also want to acknowledge important, long-standing traditions here at Emory. As we move together as a community through this spring semester — always a time of growth and renewal — we’re also preparing to welcome our newest cohort of student scholars, the Class of 2024. The evening of Wednesday, March 25, our final round of admitted first-year students will receive their eagerly awaited confirmation emails, inviting them to join the Emory community. It’s not hard for students to recall the anticipation you may have felt as a high school senior awaiting that notification as you decided where to enroll. We absolutely share in that excitement. We also want to recognize the important work being done by teams at the Office of Admission on the Atlanta campus and the Office of Enrollment Services on the Oxford campus to share admissions information with prospective Emory students. In the days ahead, those offices will continue working diligently to provide new remote opportunities for future Eagles to connect with current students, faculty, and staff. For the latest developments in our new normal together, we invite you to check out the recently relaunched Emory COVID-19 website, which now features information organized to provide quick answers for faculty, staff and students, including important resources for remote learning and working. Thank you for standing with Emory as we face our shared challenges — honoring the past, while building toward the future. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare</p>\n<p>March 23, 2020 1:09 PM LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis Graduate Students LGS Community, We write to follow up on the message from the Interim Provost Leadership Team to provide a process for requesting a change of grading basis from letter grade to S/U. We provide this added flexibility in recognition of the change to remote education, and your need to manage this in the context of broader efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. You can change the grading basis of one, some, or all of your courses, and you will have several weeks to make your decision. We encourage you to discuss this with your advisor, especially if you are considering this change for a required course. How to make a request: You can make requests now through April 10.</p>\n<p>Use this form: LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis to S/U. You will need to log in to the form using your Emory credentials.</p>\n<p>LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis to S/U. To help us process requests in a timely and accurate manner, follow the steps below to identify the classes that should be changed: Log in to your OPUS account, click “Course Planning and Enrollment,” and then “View My Classes.” That screen will have the information you need to provide in the form: (1) course subject and number, and (2) class and section number.

As we announced last week, the fund will help with the emergency financial needs of full and part-time degree-seeking students enrolled at Emory as of March 11, 2020, who demonstrate verifiable financial hardship related to COVID-19. Assistance may include help with a range of challenges associated with COVID-19, including basic needs (food, special housing circumstances, medicine, etc.), educational support needs (travel to a safe learning location, remote learning needs, etc.), and family/medical needs (job loss, medical deductible, etc.). Starting today, qualified students with direct COVID-19 related financial hardships are encouraged to apply for support through this fund, which will be available from March 23, 2020, through June 30, 2020. Applications should be submitted through the Finance website. Emory’s Division of Campus Life, working with an oversight committee, will review all applications in consideration of special requests. Emory employees, who are enrolled in degree programs, are not eligible for support through this fund but are encouraged to seek support through the Emory University Hardship Fund, which assists faculty and staff. A reminder for students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, beginning today, Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. To help everyone in the Emory community gain access to quick reliable information, we will relaunch the Emory COVID-19 website with specific areas for faculty, staff and students to obtain the necessary resources for remote learning/working, latest guidelines and campus operations. Lastly, everyone should be practicing social distancing whether you are remote or on campus. The global pandemic COVID-19 has presented many moments of uncertainty, and together, we are navigating unprecedented challenges. As students enter a new week at Emory, beginning our new phase of remote learning, know that faculty, staff and administrators are here to offer support. Despite the distances that physically divide us, we are fully committed to ensuring your success and maintaining our bond as an academic community. For Emory, and the nation, this is an historic moment — a time defined by our collective efforts to maintain our educational mission and momentum as we work to help mitigate a global pandemic. Those are remarkable, worthy goals, and we believe this community is up to the challenge. Together, we are moving forward as educational pioneers. Our thanks goes out to everyone — students, faculty, staff and administrators — for all that you are doing, every day, to make that possible. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 21, 2020 9:13 AM Emory’s Transition to Remote Learning Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community: On Monday, March 23, life at Emory University will begin to look different. The Emory community will advance into our new phase of remote learning and — for many staff members — working remotely. While that will necessarily bring changes, it won’t deter our mission to create and share knowledge, and it will not break our sense of community. While the changes we are experiencing may feel isolating and even overwhelming, in a remarkable way they have also brought us closer together, as we navigate this shared experience. And there are parts of the Emory experience that will not change. Emory faculty remain among the very best in their fields, with the resources and creativity to deliver an exceptional learning experience. Our talented staff remain dedicated to our mission and service to our students. And the resiliency of our student body is inspiring. Thank you to everyone for your contributions to our community. For everyone, confronting COVID-19 requires a big adjustment. But as you grapple with new challenges, please know that you are not alone — resources are available, along with people eager to help, even from afar. We encourage everyone to prioritize their mental health and wellbeing in the coming days and weeks. If you are on campus or if you are at home, the following resources are available to you: Students: Counseling and Psychological Services and Oxford Counseling and Career Services Staff: Working Through COVID-19 and FSAP. And each day, please take time for self-care. Get some fresh air, take a walk, get some exercise —all of which can be accomplished while maintaining social distancing. We are impressed with the many ways our students are maintaining relationships across the miles, and are hard at work to provide additional opportunities to connect and maintain the heart of Emory, even at a distance. For those students, staff and faculty who must remain on campus, we ask you to continue exercising care and compassion by practicing social distancing. That includes avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people and remaining six feet apart at all times. Under these federal recommendations, parties and large social gatherings are discouraged at this time. To support security and social distancing measures, Emory’s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have made adjustments to operating structures, which include campus building closures and reduced hours of operation and summer program cancellations: Atlanta and Oxford Campus Building Security and Access Beginning Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and will only be accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. While most faculty, staff and students have active Emory ID cards that will permit access to their buildings, we anticipate some may not. Those who lack required building access should coordinate access with your department and the EmoryCard office. Questions may be directed to: emorycard@emory.edu. Additional information about pop-up EmoryCard Office access will be provided in a separate communication. Atlanta Campus Closed or Reduced Hours of Operation Currently closed: Woodruff P.E. Center, Student Activity &#x26; Academic Center (excepting mail and dining), Emory Student Center, Alumni Memorial University Center, Schwartz Center for Performing Arts, Carlos Museum, Woodruff Library, Barnes &#x26; Noble</p>\n<p>Reduced hours: Dining hall hours will vary. Visit the Dining website for updated hours and availability.</p>\n<p>Boxed food options: For those remaining on the Druid Hills campus, boxed meals can be picked up in the Dobbs Common Table in the Emory Student Center at the hours indicated on the Dining website. Parking and Transportation Beginning Friday, March 20, until further notice, the parking decks listed below will have free entry/exit for use by Emory and Emory Healthcare personnel who are considered essential. This change in parking policy is provided to support social distancing during the COVID-19 campus operating environment. Email any parking questions to parking@emory.edu.

International Travel/Summer Study Abroad In keeping with the university’s indefinite suspension of international travel, Emory is canceling all Emory-sponsored undergraduate international travel for Summer 2020, including summer study abroad programs. Emory also encourages faculty and staff responsible for organizing any Summer 2020 Emory-sponsored international travel for graduate or professional students, either group or individual, to reconsider their plans, as such travel may not be allowed given the uncertain duration of the international travel suspension. This decision is being made in light of Emory’s international travel suspension and the possibility that planned summer travel could be disrupted by potential entry restrictions by the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, as Emory and its partners and colleagues abroad focus on their COVID-19 response, preparations that would normally be made to ensure safe and meaningful academic experiences abroad cannot be effectively executed. Students who have been planning Emory-sponsored travel should work with their units on any logistical or administrative issues resulting from this cancelation, such as the refund of paid deposits. Emory understands the importance of summer experiences abroad to students’ Emory program and remains committed to working with them to ensure academic continuity during this challenging time. As we continue to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic COVID-19 pandemic, we remain inspired and grateful for your help in facing change together. We encourage you to be patient next week with the faculty as we launch our courses remotely, with our staff as we implement new technology, and with each other as we find our new normal. The strength of our combined efforts today will go far in protecting the health and safety of everyone in the days to come. We can all play a role in helping turn the tide of this ongoing public health crisis. Thank you for doing your part. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 20, 2020 3:30 PM Oxford College: Getting Ready for Remote Learning Oxford College Students Dear Oxford College Students: As you prepare to transition to remote learning, Oxford College faculty and staff are doing the same. We have prepared FAQs to ready you for remote learning next week. You will certainly have many questions not addressed here. Your best source for up-to-date information from Emory University is our dedicated COVID-19 page. Please send specific questions about Oxford academics—classes, pre-registration, advising, and academic support—to the Oxford Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Please send general questions to OxfordDean@emory.edu for review and response. We are all finding new ways to help one another through these unprecedented times. Please know we are here to support you. Sincerely, Valerie Molyneaux</p>\n<p>Associate Dean for Academic Affairs</p>\n<p>Oxford College of Emory University 1. How do I resume class on Monday, March 23? Your faculty member for each individual class is scheduled to communicate with you by the end of the day on Thursday, March 19, 2020, about procedures for class. Some classes may be synchronous (real time as listed on OPUS, Eastern Standard Time). Others may be fully asynchronous (without real-time interaction). Some classes may have both synchronous and asynchronous elements. 2. What if I have not heard from my faculty member by the deadline? Please wait until the deadline has elapsed. Faculty may need every moment to prepare and communicate their plans for this major transition. After that, please contact Oxford College’s Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Valerie Molyneaux, for assistance (vmolyne@emory.edu). 3. How can I prepare for remote (online) learning? If you have not already done so, please complete the Oxford College remote learning survey. Oxford College Information Technology is using survey responses to support students who report access difficulties or barriers, so please complete the survey to allow us to support you through this period of remote learning. As possible, establish a secure internet connection. Gather trouble-shooting information, such as passwords and internet provider customer service contact information. Test your equipment, making sure that you can see and be seen through your camera, and hear and be heard through your speaker(s) and microphone. Zoom, Emory’s telecommunication platform, offers a test meeting site to check your equipment. Oxford also has resources and support for remote learning. Remote (online) learning will present new challenges. Daily log-ins to Canvas, even for asynchronous courses; close and careful reading of class communications (ideally on a computer screen, not just a phone); a regular study routine (ideally in a distraction-free space reserved for study); and connecting virtually with faculty and classmates can all help. 4. Can I use Oxford/Emory library materials? Access to Emory University databases, eJournals, and our large collection of digital books and reference tools will continue to be available online. Please see the Remote Library Resources and Services Guide for details about accessing these resources. Contact the Oxford Library at 770.784.8380, through email at ox-librarystaff@listserv.cc.emory.edu, or through the chat widget on the Oxford Library homepage. Please watch EaglePost for an announcement from your Oxford College Library about expanded access to online textbook/ course materials from select publishers. 5. How will I register for fall classes? Due to extended Spring Break, the timeline for Fall 2020 pre-registration has delayed one week. Official enrollment appointments will be updated by Wednesday, March 18 in OPUS. If you have questions about enrollment or registration, please contact the Advising Support Center (oxadvising@emory.edu). As of Tuesday, March 17, 2020, no changes or decisions have yet been announced regarding whether summer and future semesters will be offered remotely or in person. At this time, we are planning for regular operations; all updates will be communicated to students, faculty, and staff by the Office of the Provost. 6. How will I participate in academic advising? Rising second-year students (Oxford Class of 2021): work directly with your faculty advisor. If you have not heard from your advisor by March 27, 2020, please contact the Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Rising juniors/ graduating sophomores (Oxford Class of 2020): you have several advising options. Students who have declared a major in Emory College may receive separate communications from major departments. All Oxford students continuing to Emory College have a professional advisor in the Office for Undergraduate Education (Emory College’s equivalent to Oxford’s ASC); click here to find your advisor. Students continuing to the Goizueta Business School and School of Nursing, you will hear directly from the BBA and BSN programs about advising and registration procedures. Oxford faculty advisors and the ASC are always available to give general advice to rising juniors/ graduating sophomores as well. 7. Will I stay on track to graduate? Students will be provided equivalent opportunities to complete their current spring semester classes that they would have had during residential learning. 8. What happens to the accommodations I have on file through the Department of Accessibility Services? While the structure of an online course may eliminate the need for many typical classroom accommodations, the environment may also create a unique set of needed accommodations. Communicate with your faculty as soon as possible to understand how the change of instruction may affect your accommodations. Visit Accommodate for more information. The Department of Accessibility Services will remain open Monday-Friday, 8am – 5pm, EST. All student appointments will be conducted via phone or virtually until further notice. DAS will not proctor exams while remote instruction is in place. If you have any questions or concerns, please email the Oxford office: oas_oxford@emory.edu. 9. Is academic support still available? Yes, remotely! Please see details below. Writing Center The Writing Center will be open for individual online consultations from 2PM to 10PM EST, Sundays through Thursdays through the end of the semester. Consultations will take place through Google docs and Zoom. To make an appointment, visit oxford.mywconline.com.

As each day brings new challenges, we want to help students feel confident about maintaining their academic progress. We also recognize a hard truth: Emory undergraduate, graduate and professional students of various income levels and backgrounds may incur financial hardships as a result of COVID-19. In order to respond to these emerging needs and offer support to our students in crisis, Emory has established a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund which will be managed by Campus Life. More information about this new fund — and application guidelines — is anticipated to be released on Monday, March 23, 2020. In addition, students may request the option of satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading in place of a letter grade for a course or courses taken during the Spring 2020 term. Faculty members may also request that a graded course be changed to satisfactory/unsatisfactory based on changes related to the move to remote learning. Schools and colleges will review these requests and respond to them through school-based governance policies and committees, and additional information will be provided to you soon by your school. As always, we appreciate the flexibility and willingness to embrace these grading modifications that have been demonstrated by our faculty and students. As we move forward together in adapting to new learning styles, know that Emory will continue to seek ways to best support our community. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

It is with great sadness that I write to let you know we have made the difficult, but absolutely necessary decision, to cancel our traditional May commencement activities. However, I also want to share with you that planning already is underway to celebrate and commemorate the Class of 2020 as we are living in an extraordinary time. We did not make this decision lightly. I recognize that it will cause disappointment, especially for our graduates and their loved ones. But cancellation of the on-campus activities is, at present, the one option that ensures the safety and well-being of our Emory community members. We must be proactive in our mitigation efforts against COVID-19. Nevertheless, I apologize that we will not have our regular graduation celebrations, and wanted to let you know as soon as possible to help you with your plans. Thankfully, cancellation will not be the last word. Together, we will recognize all that you have accomplished and celebrate your creativity, resilience, and resolve. I wish you great success as you move forward into the next phase of your lives. I appreciate your patience and continued understanding as we navigate these challenges. Most of all, I encourage each member of the Emory community to continue to care for yourselves and your families during these very stressful times. We will remain guided by our mission of putting knowledge to work in the service of all humanity. The present times call for compassion and for courage. With gratitude, Claire E. Sterk</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 4:00 PM Guidance for LGS Student Research &#x26; Academic Progress Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Dear LGS Community, As you are aware, Emory University is taking extraordinary steps to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. I write to provide guidance on what this means for LGS. All LGS students should begin working remotely immediately, to the fullest extent possible, with transitions completed no later than Friday, March 20, 2020. Faculty advisors should work with their graduate students to develop individualized plans to continue their research remotely. All LGS students who currently receive stipends, including those supported by research grants, will continue to receive their stipends. LGS students should not be assigned as essential lab personnel with on-campus responsibilities. No student may be compelled to come to campus for any purpose.Faculty must be flexible to support remote work arrangements for LGS students. In the event that a laboratory engaged in essential research activities requires an LGS student to maintain a physical presence in the lab, this must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director, the PI’s Department Chair, and the Dean of the Laney Graduate School. The resulting decision will be reported to the PI’s School/Unit Dean. LGS will provide additional guidance and update the FAQs on the LGS COVID-19 webpage. LGS will work closely with graduate programs to mitigate the impact on student academic progress in order to meet the academic needs of each student. We recognize that transitioning certain kinds of research activities to remote work will require careful planning and may affect academic progress. We will provide further guidance as the implications for the research environment continue to unfold. If you have questions or concerns about academic progress, please reach out to your Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director. Students outside of lab environments should contact Interim Assistant Dean Mackenzie Bristow. Students in lab environments should contact Associate Dean Amanda Marie James. Directors of Graduate Studies/Program Directors should contact Senior Associate Dean Cathryn Johnson. During these rapidly evolving circumstances, we must work together and stay connected to protect our community. We appreciate your partnership and efforts to keep our community safe. Please regularly check the Emory University and LGS COVID-19 webpages for more information. Stay strong and resolute in your practices to curtail and stop transmission. Be patient and responsibly flexible and take time for self-care.</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 11:14 AM Emory’s Commitment to our Community Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, To strengthen our investment of support for students, faculty and staff during a time of unprecedented disruption, Emory leadership will provide a series of financial initiatives, which are as follows: Refund of Unused Fee Emory will refund student accounts with a calculated amount of unused housing, dining, athletic fees, activity fees, parking fees, and other fees unrelated to academic instruction. Since instruction will continue, no instructional costs will be reimbursed (tuition, technology fees, etc.) Other services that will remain available to students, such as health related fees, will also not be refunded. Federal Work Study Income Replacement The Department of Education has authorized the payment of unutilized Federal Work Study funds to each impacted student. The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) has reviewed the funds available and is in the process of calculating the amount eligible under this program, to be awarded to eligible students in the next week. High Financial Need Student Support Stipend We understand that Emory undergraduate students with the highest financial need will experience the greatest impact associated with the expedited closure of the resident halls and shift in academic delivery. With that in mind, Emory will provide an immediate “Student Support Stipend” to eligible undergraduate students in the amount of $1,000 within the next week. Students will be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid. Student Employee Salary Replacement Emory students of various income levels and backgrounds hold jobs at Emory and are classified as student employees. These jobs may be administrative, research focused, athletic support or various other activities. The rate of pay is different for each student employee and the hours may vary by job as well as by week-to-week availability, depending upon the student’s academic load and the unit’s need. We are concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the financial well-being of these students who depend on this income in their financial planning. As a means of supporting our student employees as the university moves to remote work and students are leaving campus, we propose to pay estimated earnings for the remaining weeks of the term based on their historical time worked. Students may check with their hiring unit to see if it is possible to continue to work remotely and may be paid for that time as well. Emory Employees Pay and Compensation We are making the commitment that regular faculty and staff employed by Emory University will be paid as usual for the current anticipated duration of the social distancing protocols, no matter their role within Emory and the altered learning/working environment. The process and details are still in development, but we are committed to continuation of pay from Emory during this time of uncertainty. Emory’s administration is committed to our students’ health and well-being, and we are dedicated to supporting their educational journeys with creativity and innovation as they progress along chosen academic pathways.

And so it is natural that we share your deepest concerns for their success and wellbeing. Amid these uncertain times, that’s one reason we are committed to open communication that provides accurate, up-to-date information. A few days ago, we notified the Emory community that two undergraduate students staying at Dobbs Hall and the Clairmont campus were being tested for possible COVID-19. While awaiting test results, the students self-isolated in off-campus housing provided by the university. Today, we can report that both students have tested negative; they will remain in off-campus housing until other arrangements can be made. A third Emory student who lives off campus was tested for possible COVID-19, and has also tested negative. On March 16, two undergraduate students residing at Emory Point tested positive for COVID-19. Both students are in satisfactory condition and are self-isolating in their off-campus apartment. The students, who had left campus for spring break, have not been on the Emory University campus for more than a week; they did not report feeling ill until they returned from the break. Please be assured that Emory’s student health services and other environmental safety personnel interview all individuals within the campus community who test positive for COVID-19. Those interviews not only determine a patient’s contacts and activities, they help guide the university in taking action to safeguard the community’s health. Emory will update the public on COVID-19-specific updates and information via the Emory COVID-19 website, “Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community.” When the spread of COVID-19 was first reported in the U.S., Emory increased the frequency and intensity of its cleaning regime in all areas of the university, focusing on commons areas such as bathrooms, dining facilities and meeting rooms. If students or other members of the university community are tested for COVID-19 –– as with our two undergraduate students who were tested on March 14 — their rooms and workspaces will be cleaned and disinfected as detailed above. We have been advising students to leave campus and, if possible, return to their homes. We understand that it is not possible for all, so Emory is prepared to provide support to those who are unable to relocate and have been granted an exemption. All other students must move out of the residence halls by March 22 at 5 p.m. If you are concerned about traveling to campus to help your student move out, please know that the university can pack and ship belongings or store them locally for your student. We can also make arrangements for you and your student to move out during non-peak hours. For those students who cannot leave campus, Student Health Services will remain open. At this time, our care model will be a hybrid of virtual assessment and in-person visits. In order to manage the volume and protect the health of our patients and caregivers, Student Health Services will identify via phone the best course to seek treatment for those who feel unwell. Students with urgent concerns should call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 or Oxford Student Health Services at 770-784-8376. In the event of severe symptoms, including shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or chest pain, they should call 911 directly. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are working to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to partner closely with local and state agencies to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19.

Here is our pledge: As Emory enters this next chapter, we will strive to stay connected, maintaining our essential bond. Even though our community may not be together physically for an unforeseen time, we are committed to moving forward together, united in spirit and service and preserving the care and compassion that have long been a hallmark of this university. That is foundational to who we are as a community, and it will not change. Over the past 24 hours, we’ve understandably received many questions — concerns about housing, remote learning and working, and especially how to best help the Emory community, particularly our students. Many answers to those questions will be updated daily at Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, a website dedicated to our response to COVID-19. It is heartening to be joined by the broader Emory community in our commitment to serving our students. In fact, it’s been moving to see just how quickly support can coalesce. Even as students began packing to leave campus, the Emory Student Government Association was distributing free MARTA passes to help with transportation. We’ve seen staff members working long hours to assist students with specific needs, faculty rapidly developing online lesson plans, and caring alumni who’ve stepped forward to volunteer their help. That outpouring of support has been heartwarming and, of course, not unexpected. For those who are able and eager to help, please consider contributing to the student hardship fund . In addition, the faculty and staff hardship fund offers assistance to other members of our campus community who might be impacted by COVID-19. Moving forward, perhaps one of the most important things we can all do is stay strong and healthy for each other — for our communities, our families and our friends. Let’s work to preserve those connections, our fundamental human bonds. Amid these remarkable times, let us prove what a community can be. Together, we will be stronger for it.</p>\n<p>In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S.

With that in mind, we wanted to notify our community that two Emory University students in undergraduate housing are being tested for possible COVID-19. Neither case has been confirmed but, out of an abundance of caution, both students are self-isolating in off-campus housing provided by the university. The Emory community will be notified if one or both students test positive. The undergraduates live in Dobbs Hall and at the Clairmont Campus, respectively. Their roommates have been notified and are being supported by student health services staff. The students’ rooms have been cleaned and disinfected by Emory Environmental Health and Safety personnel. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are taking action around-the-clock to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to work closely with local and state partners to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19. We understand that the uncertainty and quickly changing dynamic around COVID-19 can bring stress and anxiety. Emory is committed to keeping our community informed and to provide as many resources as possible. Many of these resources and key updates can be found at Emory’s COVID-19 website. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases in Georgia and across the country, students should self-assess for fever or cough. Students who develop symptoms need to separate themselves from others and call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 (Clifton Rd. campus), or Oxford College Student Services at 770-784-8376.

We are all disappointed about the need to transition to remote learning and, for many employees, remote working. But we are all dedicated to making the changes necessary to keep each other safe as we continue with the vital mission of the university “to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity,” which is needed now more than ever. Already, you are showing the strength and service that defines the Emory community. Students are reaching out to support each other. Faculty are coming together to adapt their courses for remote learning and plan how they will continue their research. At every level of the university, staff members are going the extra mile to make sure that everyone receives the information and resources they need for our community to continue to thrive even in the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Some of you may be frustrated or anxious in the face of these unprecedented circumstances for you, your family, the university and our broader community. Please know that we are working to answer your questions as quickly and thoroughly as possible in a rapidly evolving situation. Please visit our dedicated website, Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, daily for newly updated information and answers to common questions on topics ranging from health and support resources to classes, housing, travel, events, finances and other logistics as we all make this transition together. Please note especially the information on travel and events. In the coming days, we know that the Emory community will remain strong and connected by our common purpose, even if we are no longer together in person on our campuses. Beyond your courses or work assignments, continue to reach out to each other by phone or video to sustain our networks of care and compassion. And as you support each other, know that we are here to support you as well. In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Emory has now indefinitely suspended all official and previously authorized international travel and is strongly urging our campus community to postpone all university-sponsored domestic travel. Please view Emory’s latest travel restrictions here. We are continuing to monitor the situation and observe all guidance from Emory related to the Coronavirus. We will reopen the program when University directives advise that it is safe to do so. We do not know when that will be. Please continue to collect the necessary materials to apply for PDS funds once the program reopens. We intend to provide enhanced access to PDS funds at that time. During the PDS program suspension period, we will adjust the window for submitting follow-up documentation and reports. For trips/projects that have occurred during February and March 2020, you will now have up to 60 days from the end date to submit these items. Like many other disruptions related to the Coronavirus, this guidance may interfere with your professional plans in the coming months. We are very grateful for your patience and understanding. If you have any specific questions, please direct them to lgs.profdev@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 13, 2020 10:15 AM Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Extended Spring Break As a reminder, Emory University will extend spring break for students until Sunday, March 22, 2020. During this time, no in-person or remote classes should take place. The University will transition to remote learning beginning Monday, March 23. Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Qualifying examinations and thesis and dissertation defenses may take place on campus as scheduled. However, meetings should limit in-person participation to committee members only and options for remote participation must be offered. If desired, public participation may be arranged via remote connection. We strongly advise meeting participants who are considered at higher risk to participate remotely. Please consider social distancing and respiratory hygiene best practices for all meetings. For the remainder of the term, approval forms should be submitted electronically and include scanned signatures. Emory Zoom is recommended and useful for the practices above. Emory’s Teaching and Learning Technologies provides workshops, practice sessions, and instruction videos. Please submit any questions about defenses and exams to Ulf Nilsson at unilsso@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 12, 2020 1:00 PM Oxford Housing Move Out/Stay Request Form Oxford College Students Hello Oxford College Students, This communication is an outline to help you with planning next steps as a result of Emory University’s response to COVID-19.

Subject: Emory discontinuing on-site study abroad programs Dear study abroad students, In our email to you yesterday, we offered all study abroad students the option to return home and continue their studies remotely as programs permit. Since then, President Trump announced that most travel from Europe to the U.S. will be restricted for 30 days, and Emory University has decided to extend spring break and move to remote learning. We are reaching out to follow-up on our previous email amid the changing international landscape. As these changes highlight, international travel is growing increasingly inaccessible. Emory University is discontinuing all on-site study abroad programs. At this time, we are directing all study abroad students to return home and continue their studies remotely. We remain committed to working with you directly to determine the best method to maintain academic continuity. In most cases, this will mean completing online coursework provided by your current program or university abroad. If an online option is not available, we will work with you to make a contingency plan. These changes will obviously disrupt your semester plans. We ask that you be patient as we work with you to find an individualized solution for the remainder of your semester. Every student will have unique circumstances to consider when making plans to return home. Students who are not U.S. citizens, have underlying medical conditions, or have other extenuating circumstances should move quickly to make travel plans. If you are a non-U.S. citizen, you should arrange to travel immediately to a location that is suitab</p>","id":"3982f20c-d77d-5567-b336-271308601fdb","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-emory/2020-04-08-23_26_09/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Emory-Wide Remote Learning for Students"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>April 8, 2020 10:59 AM Emory Mental and Emotional Support Resources Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, By now, we’ve all experienced what it feels like to teach, learn and work remotely during a global pandemic. And what a sweeping transition it has been — from adjusting to new virtual classroom experiences to expanded responsibilities at home, balancing work with the challenges of homeschooling our children or caring for loved ones as we shelter in place. While these changes are necessary to fight COVID-19, they aren’t always easy. Social isolation and physical distancing is hard. Working long hours amid looming economic uncertainties is trying. Being forced to abruptly develop a new way of teaching and learning mid-semester has been a challenge. Please know that you are not alone. At Emory, we recognize the many adjustments you face and feel the stress of those changes, too. We also have the resources and ability to help, even in this new age of physical distancing. Undergraduate and graduate students should know that Emory’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is offering telehealth clinical services, where you can speak with a counselor or talk with a member of a triage team who can make assessments and help guide next steps. CAPS is also offering virtual workshops at 2 p.m. on Friday afternoons via Zoom to help manage stress, anxiety and feelings of social isolation. In addition, a series of peer-led virtual discussion groups begins April 13 to address academics, concerns about the future, home life and feelings of loneliness. Learn more about CAPS services during COVID-19. Student Health Services is offering telehealth appointments for both COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 related health questions. To learn more, please visit Campus Life. For faculty and staff who may need emotional support, the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) offers free and confidential services to help promote emotional, behavioral and organizational health. To support the increasing needs of our faculty, staff, physicians, trainees and their families throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, FSAP now offers tele-mental health services through telephonic and video-conferencing sessions and consultations. Videoconferencing services are conducted through a HIPAA-compliant Zoom platform. To learn more about the emotional support services offered by FSAP or to find help for you or a family member, please contact FSAP at 404-727-WELL (9355), efsap@emory.edu, or www.fsap.emory.edu. FSAP also offers a range of educational webinars and group support sessions focused on leadership and team services, addressing topics that range from stress management strategies and tips for healthy remote working to resilience and conflict management coaching. For more information about working through the COVID-19 pandemic, Emory Human Resources has launched a dedicated website offering guidance, support and tips for the unique challenges we now face, whether it’s balancing work and family life, learning how to work remotely, taking care of ourselves, or figuring out how to get bills paid. Usha Rackliffe, associate professor of practice at Emory’s Goizueta Business School, consolidated publicly available resources that we have added to the COVID-19 site to help students, faculty and staff access information and resources, including information on mortgage payments, student loans, rent, taxes and credit cards to help our community get the help that we need during this unprecedented time. Knowing where to find reliable, accessible support along the way can help in managing challenging times, and we encourage you to explore and take advantage of the resources available to you.

Care and compassion are essential to our mission of education and service. These values have proven crucial in guiding our response to the coronavirus pandemic. Emory has long strived to create a community of belonging. Within that charge, we recognize the importance of standing together during difficult times to support and encourage one another. Across the nation and the world, however, fears over COVID-19 have sometimes erupted into anger and accusations, racism and xenophobia. Globally, reports of anti-Asian bias and blatant harassment have been on the increase. Sadly, these behaviors have even been directed at frontline health care workers in hospitals throughout the U.S. as they work to treat patients, save lives and serve the public — all under incredibly stressful conditions. And our students, while pursuing their education and resuming their lives, have not been spared from the hate. As we find our way forward, let us not forget our essential Emory values. Mean-spirited, untruthful, socially stigmatizing remarks, slurs and actions do not represent who we are as a community. In fact, they stand in direct opposition to our most foundational principles. Simply put, there is no room for hate at Emory. Please know that bias and harassment within our community will not be tolerated. Indeed, harassment of any person or group of persons on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap or veteran’s status is a form of discrimination specifically prohibited by university policy. If members of the Emory community encounter such behaviors, on or off campus, we want to hear from you. For more information and support, please contact the Emory University Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at 404-727-9867 or oei@emory.edu. We recognize that harassment takes many forms. Some members of the Emory community have recently reported encountering incidents of “Zoombombing” — instances of uninvited guests crashing online Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars in order to shout slurs and share offensive materials. While Zoom has options to combat such intrusions, Emory’s Library and Information Technology Services (LITS) team recommends that those concerned with unwanted intrusions should require meeting passwords or, for smaller meetings, use a “waiting room.” For step-by-step guidance, please visit here. Additional questions may be directed to videoservices@emory.edu. Spreading inaccurate information can too easily lead to scapegoating and other forms of disrespect, particularly aimed at persons of Asian descent. During this challenging time, we also urge members of the Emory community to seek out factual information, consulting official and evidence-based sources. For accurate information and updates on how the coronavirus is impacting Emory, please visit COVID-19 updates. At Emory, we all have a role in building our community of belonging aided by members who are respectful of one another and find value in the richness and complexity of our shared diversity. Our inability to be physically present with one another offers an opportunity for us to demonstrate support for each other and to form an even deeper connection to our core values. Now more than ever, let us celebrate our Emory values and strengthen our fundamental bond, affirming the dignity and humanity of each other through our words and actions. Though apart, we remain, as always, in community.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Tips for preventing Zoombombing To avoid having your Zoom meetings interrupted, take the following precautions: Do not share Zoom links on social media or external facing websites; only communicate your Zoom links through email or other secure means.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, add a Password, which you would then communicate to your participants. They will be prompted to enter the password any time they attempt to enter the meeting room.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, enable a Waiting Room. This means you have to manually allow in any of your participants. Be sure to keep an eye on the waiting room, and click “admit” in the participant window to allow people in. Encouraging participants to enter the room with their full name will help you keep track of them. If you have a second meeting leader, this is a great job for them, so that you can lead the meeting and someone else can manage the participant list.</p>\n<p>While in the room, you can also limit the screen sharing capacity just to the host. This will not work if your participants need to share their screens, but if they do not, follow these steps to limit the sharing. Be sure to take the time to familiarize yourself with Zoom’s settings and features so you understand how to protect your virtual space when you need to. Resources LITS has tips and advice on Zoom settings to avoid Zoombombing.</p>\n<p>The Emory Police Department also has some helpful tips. What to do if you experience Zoombombing If you are hosting a Zoom call with an Emory-sponsored Zoom account and the call gets Zoombombed, please report the incident to the Emory Police Department by calling 404.727.6111 (TDD/TTY 404.320.1024) or by reporting the incident via LiveSafe.</p>\n<p>April 2, 2020 2:01 PM Change to S/U Option Emory College Students Today we are announcing changes to the S/U grading basis plan, which now includes an extended deadline and petition option. We want to share more information on how these changes will affect Emory College students specifically. Changes to S/U Grading Option We will extend the current S/U change deadline until April 27 (the last day of class for this semester).</p>\n<p>the current S/U change deadline until (the last day of class for this semester). After April 27, students will have the option to submit a petition to request a change from a letter grade to S/U basis. Petition information will available on the Committee on Academic Standards website no later than April 24, 2020. Students must submit their petition for consideration by the following deadline: Graduating Seniors – May 11 All other students – May 18</p>\n<p>Spring 2020 Study Abroad students who are considering changes to the grading basis of their courses must contact their Study Abroad Advisor in order to make any changes. They cannot make changes in OPUS. Other Academic Options There have been no other changes to the academic options available to you. Withdrawal Petition is available until April 10</p>\n<p>Extended Withdrawal Deadline (for First-Year, Oxford and Transfer students) is April 3</p>\n<p>Incompletes may be requested in discussion with your academic advisor through April 27. We have been listening to the concerns that students have raised that S/U grades may put them in less competitive positions without a universal mandate. We especially appreciate the desire expressed in an on-line petition, and elsewhere, to protect the most vulnerable members of our student community. At the same time, we understand that many students want to pursue letter grades this semester. Please be assured that these issues are happening across higher education, and graduate and medical schools will all be aware of the extraordinary circumstances facing students in Spring 2020. In weighing the different grading possibilities for this semester, we have worked to understand and meet the different needs of our students as they seek to continue their academic careers during the distress of this global health crisis. There is no grading system that does not involve some tradeoff, and we recognize that no system will address all the concerns of all of our students. We know that this semester is an extraordinary one, and we want to assure everyone that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to help our students thrive during a challenging time. For questions or concerns about grading policies and practices, students should contact oue.advising@emory.edu</p>\n<p>Best wishes, Shari Obrentz, Associate Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Dan Dillard, Assistant Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Steve Savage, Associate Director of Communications, Office for Undergraduate Education</p>\n<p>March 30, 2020 5:00 PM Emory Together with Laney Alumni Graduate Students Dear Friends, Across our communities, at Emory, and in our homes with family and friends, we are all experiencing circumstances that we would never imagine. I want you to know that I am thinking of you and your loved ones and hope that you are safe and well. At the onset of the global public health crisis and continuing as long as it is needed, Emory is taking extraordinary steps to safeguard the health and well-being of the campus community. On March 23, the University transitioned to remote learning and remote work for our students, faculty, and staff. We will closely monitor and assess next steps as this situation continues to evolve. I am so very proud of how our students, faculty, and staff at Emory University and in Emory Healthcare are working together to address the needs of our communities. We need each other now more than ever. The impact of COVID-19 has created logistical and financial implications for many members of our communities. Emory is working to provide support in various ways and has launched the EmoryTogether Fund to assist with emergency needs. The added support of our alumni and donors will amplify efforts to provide funds for food, housing, health, travel, remote learning, family, and other COVID-19-related expenses. Here's how you can help. If you are able, please donate to the EmoryTogether Fund and join us in response to this pandemic. Alumni play an essential role in all that we do at Emory. We need your help now to ensure the continued progress and success of our students. We value your partnership and ask that you join with the Laney Graduate School to help students navigate these trying times with minimal disruption to their academic progress. Thank you again for your continued support of our students and the Laney Graduate School. Please stay safe and stay hopeful. With you, with great appreciation, -Lisa Lisa A.

As our community has shifted to distance learning and remote work in many areas, and the rate of cases in Georgia rapidly increases, it has become clear that it will be difficult for Emory to maintain an accurate count of members of our community who are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. For this reason, we have revised our approach to reporting confirmed cases and will no longer send announcements about illnesses on campus. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 in Georgia or Metro Atlanta, please refer to the Georgia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19 tracking. Our commitment to the health and safety of our community is unwavering as we continue to work closely with local and state health partners to monitor and manage COVID-19 and address its impact on our community. Leadership in Academic Affairs and Business Administration is currently working with schools and units to define essential activities on campus and provide guidance to both faculty and staff. We will focus our attention on around-the-clock actions to protect students, faculty, and staff who remain on campus. If your function is deemed essential and you are required to come to campus but feel you are in a high-risk group due to your age or a medical condition, please talk to your supervisor or HR representative for working options. In the event of illness If you are a student who has relocated out of Atlanta , and have become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat), call your primary care provider.</p>\n<p>, and have become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat), call your primary care provider.

If you are faculty or staff, and become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) go home immediately, contact your health provider, and do not return to work. If you are ill and unable to work, contact your supervisor, program director, department chairperson, or dean’s office. So that we may understand critical workforce needs, it is very important for you to indicate your use of sick leave in the Exempt Leave Tracking or Time and Attendance System. After illness, the Office of Injury Management (OIM) can help assess an employee’s readiness to return to work.</p>\n<p>(fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) go home immediately, contact your health provider, and do not return to work.

If you are asymptomatic, you may be able to continue to work and should self-monitor for symptoms. Everyone can do their part to keep themselves and their friends and families safe by practicing social distancing both inside and outside. Social distancing is defined as remaining out of group settings, avoiding gatherings, and maintaining a 6 feet distance from others when possible per the CDC guidelines. Emory takes the health of our faculty, students, and staff very seriously and we are doing everything within our power to keep our community safe.

To best serve our students who requested to remain on campus this semester, and maintain important community bonds, we have brought students from our Oxford and Atlanta campuses together on Emory’s Clairmont campus, where we can provide each student residential single-room accommodations. Oxford students and their belongings were transported to their new accommodations by shuttles, which were staggered to support social distancing. Once settled, Oxford faculty and staff, along with Atlanta campus colleagues, will be available to continue to support all students remaining on campus throughout the semester. Our Oxford students traditionally transition to Atlanta after their sophomore year with strong bonds in place, ready to take on leadership positions at Emory University. These same students are being welcomed to their new homes earlier than anticipated on a campus that is eager for them to feel at home. Resources have been put in place to help them create a new kind of bond with their fellow students and professors at Emory College during this unprecedented time. Many thanks to our resilient Oxford College students for making this transition and also to the many dedicated staff members on both campuses who’ve helped support them throughout the move. We appreciate everyone’s patience as we continue to adapt to new challenges, and we wholeheartedly welcome Oxford to the Atlanta campus. In times of uncertainty, there is comfort in community. We’re grateful you are part of ours.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

From staff members who’ve helped Emory students move and kept a labyrinth of campus operations running smoothly to our remarkable, resilient faculty who’ve deftly transitioned to online learning platforms — and countless others — we thank you for your hard, ongoing work. Beginning this week, Emory Report is launching a series dedicated to shining a light on those critical efforts, exploring how our staff members are supporting the daily work of the university, laboring tirelessly behind the scenes to help advance our academic goals. We remain committed to supporting those members of our community who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. That extends to individuals who contribute to many facets of Emory’s operations and who are being significantly affected by changes brought by COVID-19. In recognition of those impacts, we have advocated on behalf of Bon Appetit workers to ensure they are protected from a sudden loss of earnings. Through this collaboration, the Bon Appetit employees who support both campuses will continue to receive their regular earnings and benefits through the end of the semester. Last week we announced a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund to support students. This week the Emory Together Fund was widened to cover faculty and staff experiencing direct challenges as a result of COVID-19. By helping meet their most pressing and immediate needs, the Emory Together Fund can give members of the Emory community the ability to overcome the difficult obstacles presented by COVID-19 and future emergencies. The Emory Together Fund includes a $50,000 matching challenge to encourage the Emory community to pitch in to help students, faculty, and staff address financial difficulties, like those presented by COVID-19. In the long-term, the Emory Together Fund will continue to provide financial resources to students, faculty, and staff of Emory University to overcome future challenges. More information, including an application form and guidelines for staff and faculty, is available on Emory’s Human Resources Emory Together Fund website. As we face the challenges of each new day, Emory will continue to honor our core values and mission, supporting our community and embracing our work with creativity, collaboration and commitment. Together, we are stronger.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Course Grading Your student has received information on grading for this semester. We are offering students the option to change their grading basis from a letter grade to satisfactory/unsatisfactory, to petition for a late, single, course withdrawal without penalty or to request incomplete grades. Each option carries potential benefits and consequences and our advising team is available to meet virtually with students to discuss individual situations. We know that this is an unusual situation and we are working to offer practical solutions to the challenges we know that some students are facing. Commencement 2020 It is with great sorrow that the University has had to cancel our Commencement exercises in May 2020. I want to underscore that we are proud of all our graduating students and, as Dean Elliott noted in a message to them directly, will find a way to honor and celebrate all that they have accomplished at another time in the future. While those plans are still being formulated, we will keep your student updated. We look forward to celebrating them appropriately soon.

That swift transition represents a cultural sea change from our normal academic routines and campus operations, and its success is due, in no small part, to each and every one of you. Congratulations on embracing the rapid changes necessary to keep our learning channels — and our community — strong, stable and functional. For some of us, learning and working online will be familiar. For others, it may represent a first-time experience. Together, we are making it work — every day, finding our way forward. And with each success, both large and small, our confidence and resolve is strengthened. We recognize that the rough edges of this transition have been smoothed by the dedication of many, many individuals, whose tireless, behind-the-scenes efforts have helped keep the very machinery of Emory humming. Our deepest thanks goes out to all Emory students, faculty and staff for the hard work, long hours and resilience you’ve demonstrated in going the extra mile to make this possible. It has been an extraordinary effort. As we continue adapting to change, an important reminder: For students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, starting this week all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. Amid these new developments, we also want to acknowledge important, long-standing traditions here at Emory. As we move together as a community through this spring semester — always a time of growth and renewal — we’re also preparing to welcome our newest cohort of student scholars, the Class of 2024. The evening of Wednesday, March 25, our final round of admitted first-year students will receive their eagerly awaited confirmation emails, inviting them to join the Emory community. It’s not hard for students to recall the anticipation you may have felt as a high school senior awaiting that notification as you decided where to enroll. We absolutely share in that excitement. We also want to recognize the important work being done by teams at the Office of Admission on the Atlanta campus and the Office of Enrollment Services on the Oxford campus to share admissions information with prospective Emory students. In the days ahead, those offices will continue working diligently to provide new remote opportunities for future Eagles to connect with current students, faculty, and staff. For the latest developments in our new normal together, we invite you to check out the recently relaunched Emory COVID-19 website, which now features information organized to provide quick answers for faculty, staff and students, including important resources for remote learning and working. Thank you for standing with Emory as we face our shared challenges — honoring the past, while building toward the future.

As we announced last week, the fund will help with the emergency financial needs of full and part-time degree-seeking students enrolled at Emory as of March 11, 2020, who demonstrate verifiable financial hardship related to COVID-19. Assistance may include help with a range of challenges associated with COVID-19, including basic needs (food, special housing circumstances, medicine, etc.), educational support needs (travel to a safe learning location, remote learning needs, etc.), and family/medical needs (job loss, medical deductible, etc.). Starting today, qualified students with direct COVID-19 related financial hardships are encouraged to apply for support through this fund, which will be available from March 23, 2020, through June 30, 2020. Applications should be submitted through the Finance website. Emory’s Division of Campus Life, working with an oversight committee, will review all applications in consideration of special requests. Emory employees, who are enrolled in degree programs, are not eligible for support through this fund but are encouraged to seek support through the Emory University Hardship Fund, which assists faculty and staff. A reminder for students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, beginning today, Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. To help everyone in the Emory community gain access to quick reliable information, we will relaunch the Emory COVID-19 website with specific areas for faculty, staff and students to obtain the necessary resources for remote learning/working, latest guidelines and campus operations. Lastly, everyone should be practicing social distancing whether you are remote or on campus. The global pandemic COVID-19 has presented many moments of uncertainty, and together, we are navigating unprecedented challenges. As students enter a new week at Emory, beginning our new phase of remote learning, know that faculty, staff and administrators are here to offer support. Despite the distances that physically divide us, we are fully committed to ensuring your success and maintaining our bond as an academic community. For Emory, and the nation, this is an historic moment — a time defined by our collective efforts to maintain our educational mission and momentum as we work to help mitigate a global pandemic. Those are remarkable, worthy goals, and we believe this community is up to the challenge. Together, we are moving forward as educational pioneers. Our thanks goes out to everyone — students, faculty, staff and administrators — for all that you are doing, every day, to make that possible.

The Emory community will advance into our new phase of remote learning and — for many staff members — working remotely. While that will necessarily bring changes, it won’t deter our mission to create and share knowledge, and it will not break our sense of community. While the changes we are experiencing may feel isolating and even overwhelming, in a remarkable way they have also brought us closer together, as we navigate this shared experience. And there are parts of the Emory experience that will not change. Emory faculty remain among the very best in their fields, with the resources and creativity to deliver an exceptional learning experience. Our talented staff remain dedicated to our mission and service to our students. And the resiliency of our student body is inspiring. Thank you to everyone for your contributions to our community. For everyone, confronting COVID-19 requires a big adjustment. But as you grapple with new challenges, please know that you are not alone — resources are available, along with people eager to help, even from afar. We encourage everyone to prioritize their mental health and wellbeing in the coming days and weeks. If you are on campus or if you are at home, the following resources are available to you: Students: Counseling and Psychological Services and Oxford Counseling and Career Services Staff: Working Through COVID-19 and FSAP. And each day, please take time for self-care. Get some fresh air, take a walk, get some exercise —all of which can be accomplished while maintaining social distancing. We are impressed with the many ways our students are maintaining relationships across the miles, and are hard at work to provide additional opportunities to connect and maintain the heart of Emory, even at a distance. For those students, staff and faculty who must remain on campus, we ask you to continue exercising care and compassion by practicing social distancing. That includes avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people and remaining six feet apart at all times. Under these federal recommendations, parties and large social gatherings are discouraged at this time. To support security and social distancing measures, Emory’s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have made adjustments to operating structures, which include campus building closures and reduced hours of operation and summer program cancellations: Atlanta and Oxford Campus Building Security and Access Beginning Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and will only be accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. While most faculty, staff and students have active Emory ID cards that will permit access to their buildings, we anticipate some may not. Those who lack required building access should coordinate access with your department and the EmoryCard office. Questions may be directed to: emorycard@emory.edu. Additional information about pop-up EmoryCard Office access will be provided in a separate communication. Atlanta Campus Closed or Reduced Hours of Operation Currently closed: Woodruff P.E. Center, Student Activity &#x26; Academic Center (excepting mail and dining), Emory Student Center, Alumni Memorial University Center, Schwartz Center for Performing Arts, Carlos Museum, Woodruff Library, Barnes &#x26; Noble</p>\n<p>Reduced hours: Dining hall hours will vary. Visit the Dining website for updated hours and availability.</p>\n<p>Boxed food options: For those remaining on the Druid Hills campus, boxed meals can be picked up in the Dobbs Common Table in the Emory Student Center at the hours indicated on the Dining website. Parking and Transportation Beginning Friday, March 20, until further notice, the parking decks listed below will have free entry/exit for use by Emory and Emory Healthcare personnel who are considered essential. This change in parking policy is provided to support social distancing during the COVID-19 campus operating environment. Email any parking questions to parking@emory.edu. Email shuttle or commute questions to commute@emory.edu.

International Travel/Summer Study Abroad In keeping with the university’s indefinite suspension of international travel, Emory is canceling all Emory-sponsored undergraduate international travel for Summer 2020, including summer study abroad programs. Emory also encourages faculty and staff responsible for organizing any Summer 2020 Emory-sponsored international travel for graduate or professional students, either group or individual, to reconsider their plans, as such travel may not be allowed given the uncertain duration of the international travel suspension. This decision is being made in light of Emory’s international travel suspension and the possibility that planned summer travel could be disrupted by potential entry restrictions by the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, as Emory and its partners and colleagues abroad focus on their COVID-19 response, preparations that would normally be made to ensure safe and meaningful academic experiences abroad cannot be effectively executed. Students who have been planning Emory-sponsored travel should work with their units on any logistical or administrative issues resulting from this cancelation, such as the refund of paid deposits. Emory understands the importance of summer experiences abroad to students’ Emory program and remains committed to working with them to ensure academic continuity during this challenging time. As we continue to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic COVID-19 pandemic, we remain inspired and grateful for your help in facing change together. We encourage you to be patient next week with the faculty as we launch our courses remotely, with our staff as we implement new technology, and with each other as we find our new normal. The strength of our combined efforts today will go far in protecting the health and safety of everyone in the days to come. We can all play a role in helping turn the tide of this ongoing public health crisis. Thank you for doing your part. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 20, 2020 3:30 PM Oxford College: Getting Ready for Remote Learning Oxford College Students Dear Oxford College Students: As you prepare to transition to remote learning, Oxford College faculty and staff are doing the same. We have prepared FAQs to ready you for remote learning next week. You will certainly have many questions not addressed here. Your best source for up-to-date information from Emory University is our dedicated COVID-19 page. Please send specific questions about Oxford academics—classes, pre-registration, advising, and academic support—to the Oxford Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Please send general questions to OxfordDean@emory.edu for review and response. We are all finding new ways to help one another through these unprecedented times. Please know we are here to support you. Sincerely, Valerie Molyneaux</p>\n<p>Associate Dean for Academic Affairs</p>\n<p>Oxford College of Emory University 1. How do I resume class on Monday, March 23? Your faculty member for each individual class is scheduled to communicate with you by the end of the day on Thursday, March 19, 2020, about procedures for class. Some classes may be synchronous (real time as listed on OPUS, Eastern Standard Time). Others may be fully asynchronous (without real-time interaction). Some classes may have both synchronous and asynchronous elements. 2. What if I have not heard from my faculty member by the deadline? Please wait until the deadline has elapsed. Faculty may need every moment to prepare and communicate their plans for this major transition. After that, please contact Oxford College’s Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Valerie Molyneaux, for assistance (vmolyne@emory.edu). 3. How can I prepare for remote (online) learning? If you have not already done so, please complete the Oxford College remote learning survey. Oxford College Information Technology is using survey responses to support students who report access difficulties or barriers, so please complete the survey to allow us to support you through this period of remote learning. As possible, establish a secure internet connection. Gather trouble-shooting information, such as passwords and internet provider customer service contact information. Test your equipment, making sure that you can see and be seen through your camera, and hear and be heard through your speaker(s) and microphone. Zoom, Emory’s telecommunication platform, offers a test meeting site to check your equipment. Oxford also has resources and support for remote learning. Remote (online) learning will present new challenges. Daily log-ins to Canvas, even for asynchronous courses; close and careful reading of class communications (ideally on a computer screen, not just a phone); a regular study routine (ideally in a distraction-free space reserved for study); and connecting virtually with faculty and classmates can all help. 4. Can I use Oxford/Emory library materials? Access to Emory University databases, eJournals, and our large collection of digital books and reference tools will continue to be available online. Please see the Remote Library Resources and Services Guide for details about accessing these resources. Contact the Oxford Library at 770.784.8380, through email at ox-librarystaff@listserv.cc.emory.edu, or through the chat widget on the Oxford Library homepage. Please watch EaglePost for an announcement from your Oxford College Library about expanded access to online textbook/ course materials from select publishers. 5. How will I register for fall classes? Due to extended Spring Break, the timeline for Fall 2020 pre-registration has delayed one week. Official enrollment appointments will be updated by Wednesday, March 18 in OPUS. If you have questions about enrollment or registration, please contact the Advising Support Center (oxadvising@emory.edu). As of Tuesday, March 17, 2020, no changes or decisions have yet been announced regarding whether summer and future semesters will be offered remotely or in person. At this time, we are planning for regular operations; all updates will be communicated to students, faculty, and staff by the Office of the Provost. 6. How will I participate in academic advising? Rising second-year students (Oxford Class of 2021): work directly with your faculty advisor. If you have not heard from your advisor by March 27, 2020, please contact the Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Rising juniors/ graduating sophomores (Oxford Class of 2020): you have several advising options. Students who have declared a major in Emory College may receive separate communications from major departments. All Oxford students continuing to Emory College have a professional advisor in the Office for Undergraduate Education (Emory College’s equivalent to Oxford’s ASC); click here to find your advisor. Students continuing to the Goizueta Business School and School of Nursing, you will hear directly from the BBA and BSN programs about advising and registration procedures. Oxford faculty advisors and the ASC are always available to give general advice to rising juniors/ graduating sophomores as well. 7. Will I stay on track to graduate? Students will be provided equivalent opportunities to complete their current spring semester classes that they would have had during residential learning. 8. What happens to the accommodations I have on file through the Department of Accessibility Services? While the structure of an online course may eliminate the need for many typical classroom accommodations, the environment may also create a unique set of needed accommodations. Communicate with your faculty as soon as possible to understand how the change of instruction may affect your accommodations. Visit Accommodate for more information. The Department of Accessibility Services will remain open Monday-Friday, 8am – 5pm, EST. All student appointments will be conducted via phone or virtually until further notice. DAS will not proctor exams while remote instruction is in place. If you have any questions or concerns, please email the Oxford office: oas_oxford@emory.edu. 9. Is academic support still available? Yes, remotely! Please see details below. Writing Center The Writing Center will be open for individual online consultations from 2PM to 10PM EST, Sundays through Thursdays through the end of the semester. Consultations will take place through Google docs and Zoom. To make an appointment, visit oxford.mywconline.com. Some last-minute drop-in hours may be available, so reserving an appointment in advance is the best way to ensure that you get the time that you want.

As each day brings new challenges, we want to help students feel confident about maintaining their academic progress. We also recognize a hard truth: Emory undergraduate, graduate and professional students of various income levels and backgrounds may incur financial hardships as a result of COVID-19. In order to respond to these emerging needs and offer support to our students in crisis, Emory has established a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund which will be managed by Campus Life. More information about this new fund — and application guidelines — is anticipated to be released on Monday, March 23, 2020. In addition, students may request the option of satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading in place of a letter grade for a course or courses taken during the Spring 2020 term. Faculty members may also request that a graded course be changed to satisfactory/unsatisfactory based on changes related to the move to remote learning. Schools and colleges will review these requests and respond to them through school-based governance policies and committees, and additional information will be provided to you soon by your school. As always, we appreciate the flexibility and willingness to embrace these grading modifications that have been demonstrated by our faculty and students. As we move forward together in adapting to new learning styles, know that Emory will continue to seek ways to best support our community. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare</p>\n<p>March 18, 2020 6:06 PM Message from Dean Michael Elliott Emory College Students Message from Dean Michael Elliott I wanted to communicate with you directly about a few things that I am feeling and thinking as we approach the \"new normal\" of remote teaching.

It is with great sadness that I write to let you know we have made the difficult, but absolutely necessary decision, to cancel our traditional May commencement activities. However, I also want to share with you that planning already is underway to celebrate and commemorate the Class of 2020 as we are living in an extraordinary time. We did not make this decision lightly. I recognize that it will cause disappointment, especially for our graduates and their loved ones. But cancellation of the on-campus activities is, at present, the one option that ensures the safety and well-being of our Emory community members. We must be proactive in our mitigation efforts against COVID-19. Nevertheless, I apologize that we will not have our regular graduation celebrations, and wanted to let you know as soon as possible to help you with your plans. Thankfully, cancellation will not be the last word. Together, we will recognize all that you have accomplished and celebrate your creativity, resilience, and resolve. I wish you great success as you move forward into the next phase of your lives. I appreciate your patience and continued understanding as we navigate these challenges. Most of all, I encourage each member of the Emory community to continue to care for yourselves and your families during these very stressful times. We will remain guided by our mission of putting knowledge to work in the service of all humanity. The present times call for compassion and for courage. With gratitude, Claire E. Sterk</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 4:00 PM Guidance for LGS Student Research &#x26; Academic Progress Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Dear LGS Community, As you are aware, Emory University is taking extraordinary steps to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. I write to provide guidance on what this means for LGS. All LGS students should begin working remotely immediately, to the fullest extent possible, with transitions completed no later than Friday, March 20, 2020. Faculty advisors should work with their graduate students to develop individualized plans to continue their research remotely. All LGS students who currently receive stipends, including those supported by research grants, will continue to receive their stipends. LGS students should not be assigned as essential lab personnel with on-campus responsibilities. No student may be compelled to come to campus for any purpose.Faculty must be flexible to support remote work arrangements for LGS students. In the event that a laboratory engaged in essential research activities requires an LGS student to maintain a physical presence in the lab, this must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director, the PI’s Department Chair, and the Dean of the Laney Graduate School. The resulting decision will be reported to the PI’s School/Unit Dean. LGS will provide additional guidance and update the FAQs on the LGS COVID-19 webpage. LGS will work closely with graduate programs to mitigate the impact on student academic progress in order to meet the academic needs of each student. We recognize that transitioning certain kinds of research activities to remote work will require careful planning and may affect academic progress. We will provide further guidance as the implications for the research environment continue to unfold. If you have questions or concerns about academic progress, please reach out to your Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director. Students outside of lab environments should contact Interim Assistant Dean Mackenzie Bristow. Students in lab environments should contact Associate Dean Amanda Marie James. Directors of Graduate Studies/Program Directors should contact Senior Associate Dean Cathryn Johnson. During these rapidly evolving circumstances, we must work together and stay connected to protect our community. We appreciate your partnership and efforts to keep our community safe. Please regularly check the Emory University and LGS COVID-19 webpages for more information. Stay strong and resolute in your practices to curtail and stop transmission. Be patient and responsibly flexible and take time for self-care.</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 11:14 AM Emory’s Commitment to our Community Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, To strengthen our investment of support for students, faculty and staff during a time of unprecedented disruption, Emory leadership will provide a series of financial initiatives, which are as follows: Refund of Unused Fee Emory will refund student accounts with a calculated amount of unused housing, dining, athletic fees, activity fees, parking fees, and other fees unrelated to academic instruction. Since instruction will continue, no instructional costs will be reimbursed (tuition, technology fees, etc.) Other services that will remain available to students, such as health related fees, will also not be refunded. Federal Work Study Income Replacement The Department of Education has authorized the payment of unutilized Federal Work Study funds to each impacted student. The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) has reviewed the funds available and is in the process of calculating the amount eligible under this program, to be awarded to eligible students in the next week. High Financial Need Student Support Stipend We understand that Emory undergraduate students with the highest financial need will experience the greatest impact associated with the expedited closure of the resident halls and shift in academic delivery. With that in mind, Emory will provide an immediate “Student Support Stipend” to eligible undergraduate students in the amount of $1,000 within the next week. Students will be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid. Student Employee Salary Replacement Emory students of various income levels and backgrounds hold jobs at Emory and are classified as student employees. These jobs may be administrative, research focused, athletic support or various other activities. The rate of pay is different for each student employee and the hours may vary by job as well as by week-to-week availability, depending upon the student’s academic load and the unit’s need. We are concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the financial well-being of these students who depend on this income in their financial planning. As a means of supporting our student employees as the university moves to remote work and students are leaving campus, we propose to pay estimated earnings for the remaining weeks of the term based on their historical time worked. Students may check with their hiring unit to see if it is possible to continue to work remotely and may be paid for that time as well. Emory Employees Pay and Compensation We are making the commitment that regular faculty and staff employed by Emory University will be paid as usual for the current anticipated duration of the social distancing protocols, no matter their role within Emory and the altered learning/working environment. The process and details are still in development, but we are committed to continuation of pay from Emory during this time of uncertainty. Emory’s administration is committed to our students’ health and well-being, and we are dedicated to supporting their educational journeys with creativity and innovation as they progress along chosen academic pathways. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 16, 2020 7:20 PM Emory Update and Resources Especially for You Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students Dear Parents and Families, Here at Emory, students have always been our most important priority. And so it is natural that we share your deepest concerns for their success and wellbeing. Amid these uncertain times, that’s one reason we are committed to open communication that provides accurate, up-to-date information. A few days ago, we notified the Emory community that two undergraduate students staying at Dobbs Hall and the Clairmont campus were being tested for possible COVID-19. While awaiting test results, the students self-isolated in off-campus housing provided by the university. Today, we can report that both students have tested negative; they will remain in off-campus housing until other arrangements can be made. A third Emory student who lives off campus was tested for possible COVID-19, and has also tested negative. On March 16, two undergraduate students residing at Emory Point tested positive for COVID-19. Both students are in satisfactory condition and are self-isolating in their off-campus apartment. The students, who had left campus for spring break, have not been on the Emory University campus for more than a week; they did not report feeling ill until they returned from the break. Please be assured that Emory’s student health services and other environmental safety personnel interview all individuals within the campus community who test positive for COVID-19. Those interviews not only determine a patient’s contacts and activities, they help guide the university in taking action to safeguard the community’s health. Emory will update the public on COVID-19-specific updates and information via the Emory COVID-19 website, “Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community.” When the spread of COVID-19 was first reported in the U.S., Emory increased the frequency and intensity of its cleaning regime in all areas of the university, focusing on commons areas such as bathrooms, dining facilities and meeting rooms. If students or other members of the university community are tested for COVID-19 –– as with our two undergraduate students who were tested on March 14 — their rooms and workspaces will be cleaned and disinfected as detailed above. We have been advising students to leave campus and, if possible, return to their homes. We understand that it is not possible for all, so Emory is prepared to provide support to those who are unable to relocate and have been granted an exemption. All other students must move out of the residence halls by March 22 at 5 p.m. If you are concerned about traveling to campus to help your student move out, please know that the university can pack and ship belongings or store them locally for your student. We can also make arrangements for you and your student to move out during non-peak hours. For those students who cannot leave campus, Student Health Services will remain open. At this time, our care model will be a hybrid of virtual assessment and in-person visits. In order to manage the volume and protect the health of our patients and caregivers, Student Health Services will identify via phone the best course to seek treatment for those who feel unwell. Students with urgent concerns should call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 or Oxford Student Health Services at 770-784-8376. In the event of severe symptoms, including shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or chest pain, they should call 911 directly. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are working to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to partner closely with local and state agencies to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19.

We thank you for your patience as we continue to navigate this evolving situation. There are a lot of factors at play and we are working to resolve concerns as they arise. In this email we will begin to answer several questions that have been raised in regard to your academics directly with us or through your representatives on College Council.</p>\n<p>Fall 2020 Pre-Registration Pre-Registration will be delayed one week for all undergraduate schools. The new schedule is attached, and we have adjusted your registration appointments accordingly. Appointment times will remain the same, only the date has been amended. These times, which are all in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), should be viewable in OPUS now.</p>\n<p>If you have an advising appointment with a faculty member this week, please confirm with them if this will go ahead or if they would like to postpone your appointment. Faculty are working hard on revising course syllabi so please be flexible. Class Management &#x26; Faculty Expectations Individual instructors will provide you with exact details on course arrangements no later than 5 p.m. EDT on Thursday, March 19. We want to be clear with you regarding teaching expectations from the administration: Synchronous classes will meet at their regularly scheduled time, just in a remote format.</p>\n<p>Some course content may be delivered in an asynchronous format, or a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions. Each delivery method offers different learning opportunities for students that the other method could not provide. Students should expect that faculty will offer this combination.</p>\n<p>Faculty are expected to continue offering regular instruction, assessment and feedback throughout the duration of the semester.</p>\n<p>Faculty are expected to offer office hours through a virtual platform. You should confirm the times/availability of these directly with your faculty.</p>\n<p>Experiential Courses (labs, research, performance courses, internships, etc.) are under review. While you will be unable to continue these courses on campus, your instructors/coordinators are working hard to translate these into a suitable remote format. Some instructors have already provided information about alternative activities; others are working to develop options. More information will be provided as it becomes available. If any of the arrangements communicated by your instructors pose significant difficulties to you (e.g. time differences, lack of reliable internet), please reach out to them and explain your concerns. Faculty are prepared to work with you as best as they can. Technology Access If you do not have access to a computer or are concerned about regular internet access in your home location, please also reach out to OUE directly at oue.advising@emory.edu.

Here is our pledge: As Emory enters this next chapter, we will strive to stay connected, maintaining our essential bond. Even though our community may not be together physically for an unforeseen time, we are committed to moving forward together, united in spirit and service and preserving the care and compassion that have long been a hallmark of this university. That is foundational to who we are as a community, and it will not change. Over the past 24 hours, we’ve understandably received many questions — concerns about housing, remote learning and working, and especially how to best help the Emory community, particularly our students. Many answers to those questions will be updated daily at Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, a website dedicated to our response to COVID-19. It is heartening to be joined by the broader Emory community in our commitment to serving our students. In fact, it’s been moving to see just how quickly support can coalesce. Even as students began packing to leave campus, the Emory Student Government Association was distributing free MARTA passes to help with transportation. We’ve seen staff members working long hours to assist students with specific needs, faculty rapidly developing online lesson plans, and caring alumni who’ve stepped forward to volunteer their help. That outpouring of support has been heartwarming and, of course, not unexpected. For those who are able and eager to help, please consider contributing to the student hardship fund . In addition, the faculty and staff hardship fund offers assistance to other members of our campus community who might be impacted by COVID-19. Moving forward, perhaps one of the most important things we can all do is stay strong and healthy for each other — for our communities, our families and our friends. Let’s work to preserve those connections, our fundamental human bonds. Amid these remarkable times, let us prove what a community can be. Together, we will be stronger for it.</p>\n<p>In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

With that in mind, we wanted to notify our community that two Emory University students in undergraduate housing are being tested for possible COVID-19. Neither case has been confirmed but, out of an abundance of caution, both students are self-isolating in off-campus housing provided by the university. The Emory community will be notified if one or both students test positive. The undergraduates live in Dobbs Hall and at the Clairmont Campus, respectively. Their roommates have been notified and are being supported by student health services staff. The students’ rooms have been cleaned and disinfected by Emory Environmental Health and Safety personnel. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are taking action around-the-clock to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to work closely with local and state partners to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19. We understand that the uncertainty and quickly changing dynamic around COVID-19 can bring stress and anxiety. Emory is committed to keeping our community informed and to provide as many resources as possible. Many of these resources and key updates can be found at Emory’s COVID-19 website. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases in Georgia and across the country, students should self-assess for fever or cough. Students who develop symptoms need to separate themselves from others and call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 (Clifton Rd. campus), or Oxford College Student Services at 770-784-8376.

We are all disappointed about the need to transition to remote learning and, for many employees, remote working. But we are all dedicated to making the changes necessary to keep each other safe as we continue with the vital mission of the university “to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity,” which is needed now more than ever. Already, you are showing the strength and service that defines the Emory community. Students are reaching out to support each other. Faculty are coming together to adapt their courses for remote learning and plan how they will continue their research. At every level of the university, staff members are going the extra mile to make sure that everyone receives the information and resources they need for our community to continue to thrive even in the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Some of you may be frustrated or anxious in the face of these unprecedented circumstances for you, your family, the university and our broader community. Please know that we are working to answer your questions as quickly and thoroughly as possible in a rapidly evolving situation. Please visit our dedicated website, Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, daily for newly updated information and answers to common questions on topics ranging from health and support resources to classes, housing, travel, events, finances and other logistics as we all make this transition together. Please note especially the information on travel and events. In the coming days, we know that the Emory community will remain strong and connected by our common purpose, even if we are no longer together in person on our campuses. Beyond your courses or work assignments, continue to reach out to each other by phone or video to sustain our networks of care and compassion. And as you support each other, know that we are here to support you as well. In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Emory has now indefinitely suspended all official and previously authorized international travel and is strongly urging our campus community to postpone all university-sponsored domestic travel. Please view Emory’s latest travel restrictions here. We are continuing to monitor the situation and observe all guidance from Emory related to the Coronavirus. We will reopen the program when University directives advise that it is safe to do so. We do not know when that will be. Please continue to collect the necessary materials to apply for PDS funds once the program reopens. We intend to provide enhanced access to PDS funds at that time. During the PDS program suspension period, we will adjust the window for submitting follow-up documentation and reports. For trips/projects that have occurred during February and March 2020, you will now have up to 60 days from the end date to submit these items. Like many other disruptions related to the Coronavirus, this guidance may interfere with your professional plans in the coming months. We are very grateful for your patience and understanding. If you have any specific questions, please direct them to lgs.profdev@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 13, 2020 10:15 AM Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Extended Spring Break As a reminder, Emory University will extend spring break for students until Sunday, March 22, 2020. During this time, no in-person or remote classes should take place. The University will transition to remote learning beginning Monday, March 23. Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Qualifying examinations and thesis and dissertation defenses may take place on campus as scheduled. However, meetings should limit in-person participation to committee members only and options for remote participation must be offered. If desired, public participation may be arranged via remote connection. We strongly advise meeting participants who are considered at higher risk to participate remotely. Please consider social distancing and respiratory hygiene best practices for all meetings. For the remainder of the term, approval forms should be submitted electronically and include scanned signatures. Emory Zoom is recommended and useful for the practices above. Emory’s Teaching and Learning Technologies provides workshops, practice sessions, and instruction videos. Please submit any questions about defenses and exams to Ulf Nilsson at unilsso@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 12, 2020 1:00 PM Oxford Housing Move Out/Stay Request Form Oxford College Students Hello Oxford College Students, This communication is an outline to help you with planning next steps as a result of Emory University’s response to COVID-19.

Subject: Emory discontinuing on-site study abroad programs Dear study abroad students, In our email to you yesterday, we offered all study abroad students the option to return home and continue their studies remotely as programs permit. Since then, President Trump announced that most travel from Europe to the U.S. will be restricted for 30 days, and Emory University has decided to extend spring break and move to remote learning. We are reaching out to follow-up on our previous email amid the changing international landscape. As these changes highlight, international travel is growing increasingly inaccessible. Emory University is discontinuing all on-site study abroad programs. At this time, we are directing all study abroad students to return home and continue their studies remotely. We remain committed to working with you directly to determine the best method to maintain academic continuity. In most cases, this will mean completing online coursework provided by your current program or university abroad. If an online option is not available, we will work with you to make a contingency plan. These changes will obviously disrupt your semester plans. We ask that you be patient as we work with you to find an individualized solution for the remainder of your semester. Every student will have unique circumstances to consider when making plans to return home. Students who are not U.S. citizens, have underlying medical conditions, or have other extenuating circumstances should move quickly to make travel plans. If you are a non-U.S. citizen, you should arrange to travel immediately to a location that is suitab</p>","id":"273fbd39-32c9-5a51-af79-396fd113d7e5","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-emory/2020-04-08-23_25_56/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Emory-Wide Remote Learning for Students"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"\"></p>\n<p>April 8, 2020 10:59 AM Emory Mental and Emotional Support Resources Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, By now, we’ve all experienced what it feels like to teach, learn and work remotely during a global pandemic. And what a sweeping transition it has been — from adjusting to new virtual classroom experiences to expanded responsibilities at home, balancing work with the challenges of homeschooling our children or caring for loved ones as we shelter in place. While these changes are necessary to fight COVID-19, they aren’t always easy. Social isolation and physical distancing is hard. Working long hours amid looming economic uncertainties is trying. Being forced to abruptly develop a new way of teaching and learning mid-semester has been a challenge. Please know that you are not alone. At Emory, we recognize the many adjustments you face and feel the stress of those changes, too. We also have the resources and ability to help, even in this new age of physical distancing. Undergraduate and graduate students should know that Emory’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is offering telehealth clinical services, where you can speak with a counselor or talk with a member of a triage team who can make assessments and help guide next steps. CAPS is also offering virtual workshops at 2 p.m. on Friday afternoons via Zoom to help manage stress, anxiety and feelings of social isolation. In addition, a series of peer-led virtual discussion groups begins April 13 to address academics, concerns about the future, home life and feelings of loneliness. Learn more about CAPS services during COVID-19. Student Health Services is offering telehealth appointments for both COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 related health questions. To learn more, please visit Campus Life. For faculty and staff who may need emotional support, the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) offers free and confidential services to help promote emotional, behavioral and organizational health. To support the increasing needs of our faculty, staff, physicians, trainees and their families throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, FSAP now offers tele-mental health services through telephonic and video-conferencing sessions and consultations. Videoconferencing services are conducted through a HIPAA-compliant Zoom platform. To learn more about the emotional support services offered by FSAP or to find help for you or a family member, please contact FSAP at 404-727-WELL (9355), efsap@emory.edu, or www.fsap.emory.edu. FSAP also offers a range of educational webinars and group support sessions focused on leadership and team services, addressing topics that range from stress management strategies and tips for healthy remote working to resilience and conflict management coaching. For more information about working through the COVID-19 pandemic, Emory Human Resources has launched a dedicated website offering guidance, support and tips for the unique challenges we now face, whether it’s balancing work and family life, learning how to work remotely, taking care of ourselves, or figuring out how to get bills paid. Usha Rackliffe, associate professor of practice at Emory’s Goizueta Business School, consolidated publicly available resources that we have added to the COVID-19 site to help students, faculty and staff access information and resources, including information on mortgage payments, student loans, rent, taxes and credit cards to help our community get the help that we need during this unprecedented time. Knowing where to find reliable, accessible support along the way can help in managing challenging times, and we encourage you to explore and take advantage of the resources available to you. Throughout the journey, Emory stands with you.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Honor Council Reminder The Emory College Honor Council would like to remind students that while you are completing coursework remotely, the Honor Code is still in effect. Be cautious as you interact and collaborate with others, or when you discuss or share your own work or the work of others. Please take a moment to review the Emory College Honor Code’s Appendix 3: Academic Misconduct in the Remote Learning Environment. Be mindful as you navigate remote teaching and learning as the new normal for the remainder of the semester. Most importantly, if you are in doubt about whether your actions may be problematic, you should contact your professor directly for clarification. Pre-Registration Pre-Registration continues this week for Emory College students. This week, students with 45+ earned hours will enroll. Please note that earned hours only includes courses that you have already completed. Hours that you are currently enrolled in this semester are NOT included in this count. In preparation for pre-registration we encourage you to: Review your enrollment times in OPUS Schedule an advising appointment with your major or pre-major faculty advisor. If you are not sure who your advisor is, their name and email address can be found in OPUS. Visit the University Course Atlas to explore courses for the Fall 2020 semester With pre-registration underway, here is part 2 of our Cool Courses feature. This feature is designed to highlight interesting opportunities, open to Emory College students, for credit. These are courses which typically have no pre-requisites. BUS 499: Design Thinking Do you want to learn a powerful approach for developing practical, creative solutions to real-world, messy, wicked problems? At its core, design thinking uses the mindset and methods of design practitioners to identify and address human needs by developing functional and emotionally meaningful products, services, processes, and spaces that address those needs. This highly experiential course, taught by Prof Jan Barton, is open to all Emory students, regardless of degree or major. Through short lectures and guided teamwork, you will learn a design thinking framework and a set of tools to help you navigate ambiguity, improve your ability to empathize with others, integrate diverse preferences and points of view, reframe challenges, ideate creative solutions, develop a “just-try-it” mindset for rapid experimentation, and enhance your presentation skills with storytelling and graphic design elements. You will showcase your learning in a final project addressing one of Emory’s current strategic challenges. REL 200R: LGBTQ Religion &#x26; Spirituality Rather than asking what religious traditions say about sexuality and gender, this course will focus on what LGBTQ-identified people have had to say about religion and spirituality, exploring their cultural agency and creativity. Here are a few examples of topics we will explore: the identification of the assassinated gay activist and politician, Harvey Milk, as \"Saint Harvey Milk\" by some LGBTQ people; lesbian feminist embodied goddess spirituality; the Radical Faeries movement; the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence order of \"queer nuns\"; the spiritual dimensions of Native American \"Two-Spirit\" identities; LGBTQ-affirming expressions of Pentecostal Christianity; LGBTQ atheism. The course will include site-visits, participant observation in cultural events, and guest speakers representing a variety of groups and communities.</p>\n<p>April 6, 2020 10:54 AM Emory’s Commitment to Belonging Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, Emory University’s motto — the wise heart seeks knowledge — underscores one of our key institutional principles: Our work here is driven by the heart. Care and compassion are essential to our mission of education and service. These values have proven crucial in guiding our response to the coronavirus pandemic. Emory has long strived to create a community of belonging. Within that charge, we recognize the importance of standing together during difficult times to support and encourage one another. Across the nation and the world, however, fears over COVID-19 have sometimes erupted into anger and accusations, racism and xenophobia. Globally, reports of anti-Asian bias and blatant harassment have been on the increase. Sadly, these behaviors have even been directed at frontline health care workers in hospitals throughout the U.S. as they work to treat patients, save lives and serve the public — all under incredibly stressful conditions. And our students, while pursuing their education and resuming their lives, have not been spared from the hate. As we find our way forward, let us not forget our essential Emory values. Mean-spirited, untruthful, socially stigmatizing remarks, slurs and actions do not represent who we are as a community. In fact, they stand in direct opposition to our most foundational principles. Simply put, there is no room for hate at Emory. Please know that bias and harassment within our community will not be tolerated. Indeed, harassment of any person or group of persons on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap or veteran’s status is a form of discrimination specifically prohibited by university policy. If members of the Emory community encounter such behaviors, on or off campus, we want to hear from you. For more information and support, please contact the Emory University Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at 404-727-9867 or oei@emory.edu. We recognize that harassment takes many forms. Some members of the Emory community have recently reported encountering incidents of “Zoombombing” — instances of uninvited guests crashing online Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars in order to shout slurs and share offensive materials. While Zoom has options to combat such intrusions, Emory’s Library and Information Technology Services (LITS) team recommends that those concerned with unwanted intrusions should require meeting passwords or, for smaller meetings, use a “waiting room.” For step-by-step guidance, please visit here. Additional questions may be directed to videoservices@emory.edu. Spreading inaccurate information can too easily lead to scapegoating and other forms of disrespect, particularly aimed at persons of Asian descent. During this challenging time, we also urge members of the Emory community to seek out factual information, consulting official and evidence-based sources. For accurate information and updates on how the coronavirus is impacting Emory, please visit COVID-19 updates. At Emory, we all have a role in building our community of belonging aided by members who are respectful of one another and find value in the richness and complexity of our shared diversity. Our inability to be physically present with one another offers an opportunity for us to demonstrate support for each other and to form an even deeper connection to our core values. Now more than ever, let us celebrate our Emory values and strengthen our fundamental bond, affirming the dignity and humanity of each other through our words and actions. Though apart, we remain, as always, in community.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Tips for preventing Zoombombing To avoid having your Zoom meetings interrupted, take the following precautions: Do not share Zoom links on social media or external facing websites; only communicate your Zoom links through email or other secure means.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, add a Password, which you would then communicate to your participants. They will be prompted to enter the password any time they attempt to enter the meeting room.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, enable a Waiting Room. This means you have to manually allow in any of your participants. Be sure to keep an eye on the waiting room, and click “admit” in the participant window to allow people in. Encouraging participants to enter the room with their full name will help you keep track of them. If you have a second meeting leader, this is a great job for them, so that you can lead the meeting and someone else can manage the participant list.</p>\n<p>While in the room, you can also limit the screen sharing capacity just to the host. This will not work if your participants need to share their screens, but if they do not, follow these steps to limit the sharing. Be sure to take the time to familiarize yourself with Zoom’s settings and features so you understand how to protect your virtual space when you need to. Resources LITS has tips and advice on Zoom settings to avoid Zoombombing.</p>\n<p>The Emory Police Department also has some helpful tips. What to do if you experience Zoombombing If you are hosting a Zoom call with an Emory-sponsored Zoom account and the call gets Zoombombed, please report the incident to the Emory Police Department by calling 404.727.6111 (TDD/TTY 404.320.1024) or by reporting the incident via LiveSafe.</p>\n<p>April 2, 2020 2:01 PM Change to S/U Option Emory College Students Today we are announcing changes to the S/U grading basis plan, which now includes an extended deadline and petition option.

Withdrawal Petition is available until April 10</p>\n<p>Extended Withdrawal Deadline (for First-Year, Oxford and Transfer students) is April 3</p>\n<p>Incompletes may be requested in discussion with your academic advisor through April 27. We have been listening to the concerns that students have raised that S/U grades may put them in less competitive positions without a universal mandate. We especially appreciate the desire expressed in an on-line petition, and elsewhere, to protect the most vulnerable members of our student community. At the same time, we understand that many students want to pursue letter grades this semester. Please be assured that these issues are happening across higher education, and graduate and medical schools will all be aware of the extraordinary circumstances facing students in Spring 2020. In weighing the different grading possibilities for this semester, we have worked to understand and meet the different needs of our students as they seek to continue their academic careers during the distress of this global health crisis. There is no grading system that does not involve some tradeoff, and we recognize that no system will address all the concerns of all of our students. We know that this semester is an extraordinary one, and we want to assure everyone that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to help our students thrive during a challenging time. For questions or concerns about grading policies and practices, students should contact oue.advising@emory.edu</p>\n<p>Best wishes, Shari Obrentz, Associate Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Dan Dillard, Assistant Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Steve Savage, Associate Director of Communications, Office for Undergraduate Education</p>\n<p>March 30, 2020 5:00 PM Emory Together with Laney Alumni Graduate Students Dear Friends, Across our communities, at Emory, and in our homes with family and friends, we are all experiencing circumstances that we would never imagine. I want you to know that I am thinking of you and your loved ones and hope that you are safe and well. At the onset of the global public health crisis and continuing as long as it is needed, Emory is taking extraordinary steps to safeguard the health and well-being of the campus community. On March 23, the University transitioned to remote learning and remote work for our students, faculty, and staff. We will closely monitor and assess next steps as this situation continues to evolve. I am so very proud of how our students, faculty, and staff at Emory University and in Emory Healthcare are working together to address the needs of our communities. We need each other now more than ever. The impact of COVID-19 has created logistical and financial implications for many members of our communities. Emory is working to provide support in various ways and has launched the EmoryTogether Fund to assist with emergency needs. The added support of our alumni and donors will amplify efforts to provide funds for food, housing, health, travel, remote learning, family, and other COVID-19-related expenses.

As our community has shifted to distance learning and remote work in many areas, and the rate of cases in Georgia rapidly increases, it has become clear that it will be difficult for Emory to maintain an accurate count of members of our community who are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. For this reason, we have revised our approach to reporting confirmed cases and will no longer send announcements about illnesses on campus. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 in Georgia or Metro Atlanta, please refer to the Georgia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19 tracking. Our commitment to the health and safety of our community is unwavering as we continue to work closely with local and state health partners to monitor and manage COVID-19 and address its impact on our community. Leadership in Academic Affairs and Business Administration is currently working with schools and units to define essential activities on campus and provide guidance to both faculty and staff. We will focus our attention on around-the-clock actions to protect students, faculty, and staff who remain on campus. If your function is deemed essential and you are required to come to campus but feel you are in a high-risk group due to your age or a medical condition, please talk to your supervisor or HR representative for working options. In the event of illness If you are a student who has relocated out of Atlanta , and have become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat), call your primary care provider.</p>\n<p>, and have become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat), call your primary care provider.

If you are faculty or staff, and become symptomatic (fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) go home immediately, contact your health provider, and do not return to work. If you are ill and unable to work, contact your supervisor, program director, department chairperson, or dean’s office. So that we may understand critical workforce needs, it is very important for you to indicate your use of sick leave in the Exempt Leave Tracking or Time and Attendance System. After illness, the Office of Injury Management (OIM) can help assess an employee’s readiness to return to work.</p>\n<p>(fever >100F, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) go home immediately, contact your health provider, and do not return to work.

If you are asymptomatic, you may be able to continue to work and should self-monitor for symptoms. Everyone can do their part to keep themselves and their friends and families safe by practicing social distancing both inside and outside. Social distancing is defined as remaining out of group settings, avoiding gatherings, and maintaining a 6 feet distance from others when possible per the CDC guidelines. Emory takes the health of our faculty, students, and staff very seriously and we are doing everything within our power to keep our community safe.

To best serve our students who requested to remain on campus this semester, and maintain important community bonds, we have brought students from our Oxford and Atlanta campuses together on Emory’s Clairmont campus, where we can provide each student residential single-room accommodations. Oxford students and their belongings were transported to their new accommodations by shuttles, which were staggered to support social distancing. Once settled, Oxford faculty and staff, along with Atlanta campus colleagues, will be available to continue to support all students remaining on campus throughout the semester. Our Oxford students traditionally transition to Atlanta after their sophomore year with strong bonds in place, ready to take on leadership positions at Emory University. These same students are being welcomed to their new homes earlier than anticipated on a campus that is eager for them to feel at home. Resources have been put in place to help them create a new kind of bond with their fellow students and professors at Emory College during this unprecedented time. Many thanks to our resilient Oxford College students for making this transition and also to the many dedicated staff members on both campuses who’ve helped support them throughout the move. We appreciate everyone’s patience as we continue to adapt to new challenges, and we wholeheartedly welcome Oxford to the Atlanta campus. In times of uncertainty, there is comfort in community. We’re grateful you are part of ours.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

From staff members who’ve helped Emory students move and kept a labyrinth of campus operations running smoothly to our remarkable, resilient faculty who’ve deftly transitioned to online learning platforms — and countless others — we thank you for your hard, ongoing work. Beginning this week, Emory Report is launching a series dedicated to shining a light on those critical efforts, exploring how our staff members are supporting the daily work of the university, laboring tirelessly behind the scenes to help advance our academic goals. We remain committed to supporting those members of our community who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. That extends to individuals who contribute to many facets of Emory’s operations and who are being significantly affected by changes brought by COVID-19. In recognition of those impacts, we have advocated on behalf of Bon Appetit workers to ensure they are protected from a sudden loss of earnings. Through this collaboration, the Bon Appetit employees who support both campuses will continue to receive their regular earnings and benefits through the end of the semester. Last week we announced a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund to support students. This week the Emory Together Fund was widened to cover faculty and staff experiencing direct challenges as a result of COVID-19. By helping meet their most pressing and immediate needs, the Emory Together Fund can give members of the Emory community the ability to overcome the difficult obstacles presented by COVID-19 and future emergencies. The Emory Together Fund includes a $50,000 matching challenge to encourage the Emory community to pitch in to help students, faculty, and staff address financial difficulties, like those presented by COVID-19. In the long-term, the Emory Together Fund will continue to provide financial resources to students, faculty, and staff of Emory University to overcome future challenges. More information, including an application form and guidelines for staff and faculty, is available on Emory’s Human Resources Emory Together Fund website. As we face the challenges of each new day, Emory will continue to honor our core values and mission, supporting our community and embracing our work with creativity, collaboration and commitment. Together, we are stronger.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

If your student has any issues with their course work, or connecting via remote technology, please ask them to reach out to their faculty members in the first instance. Course Grading Your student has received information on grading for this semester. We are offering students the option to change their grading basis from a letter grade to satisfactory/unsatisfactory, to petition for a late, single, course withdrawal without penalty or to request incomplete grades. Each option carries potential benefits and consequences and our advising team is available to meet virtually with students to discuss individual situations. We know that this is an unusual situation and we are working to offer practical solutions to the challenges we know that some students are facing. Commencement 2020 It is with great sorrow that the University has had to cancel our Commencement exercises in May 2020. I want to underscore that we are proud of all our graduating students and, as Dean Elliott noted in a message to them directly, will find a way to honor and celebrate all that they have accomplished at another time in the future. While those plans are still being formulated, we will keep your student updated. We look forward to celebrating them appropriately soon.

That swift transition represents a cultural sea change from our normal academic routines and campus operations, and its success is due, in no small part, to each and every one of you. Congratulations on embracing the rapid changes necessary to keep our learning channels — and our community — strong, stable and functional. For some of us, learning and working online will be familiar. For others, it may represent a first-time experience. Together, we are making it work — every day, finding our way forward. And with each success, both large and small, our confidence and resolve is strengthened. We recognize that the rough edges of this transition have been smoothed by the dedication of many, many individuals, whose tireless, behind-the-scenes efforts have helped keep the very machinery of Emory humming. Our deepest thanks goes out to all Emory students, faculty and staff for the hard work, long hours and resilience you’ve demonstrated in going the extra mile to make this possible. It has been an extraordinary effort. As we continue adapting to change, an important reminder: For students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, starting this week all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. Amid these new developments, we also want to acknowledge important, long-standing traditions here at Emory. As we move together as a community through this spring semester — always a time of growth and renewal — we’re also preparing to welcome our newest cohort of student scholars, the Class of 2024. The evening of Wednesday, March 25, our final round of admitted first-year students will receive their eagerly awaited confirmation emails, inviting them to join the Emory community. It’s not hard for students to recall the anticipation you may have felt as a high school senior awaiting that notification as you decided where to enroll. We absolutely share in that excitement. We also want to recognize the important work being done by teams at the Office of Admission on the Atlanta campus and the Office of Enrollment Services on the Oxford campus to share admissions information with prospective Emory students. In the days ahead, those offices will continue working diligently to provide new remote opportunities for future Eagles to connect with current students, faculty, and staff. For the latest developments in our new normal together, we invite you to check out the recently relaunched Emory COVID-19 website, which now features information organized to provide quick answers for faculty, staff and students, including important resources for remote learning and working. Thank you for standing with Emory as we face our shared challenges — honoring the past, while building toward the future.

As we announced last week, the fund will help with the emergency financial needs of full and part-time degree-seeking students enrolled at Emory as of March 11, 2020, who demonstrate verifiable financial hardship related to COVID-19. Assistance may include help with a range of challenges associated with COVID-19, including basic needs (food, special housing circumstances, medicine, etc.), educational support needs (travel to a safe learning location, remote learning needs, etc.), and family/medical needs (job loss, medical deductible, etc.). Starting today, qualified students with direct COVID-19 related financial hardships are encouraged to apply for support through this fund, which will be available from March 23, 2020, through June 30, 2020. Applications should be submitted through the Finance website. Emory’s Division of Campus Life, working with an oversight committee, will review all applications in consideration of special requests. Emory employees, who are enrolled in degree programs, are not eligible for support through this fund but are encouraged to seek support through the Emory University Hardship Fund, which assists faculty and staff. A reminder for students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, beginning today, Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. To help everyone in the Emory community gain access to quick reliable information, we will relaunch the Emory COVID-19 website with specific areas for faculty, staff and students to obtain the necessary resources for remote learning/working, latest guidelines and campus operations. Lastly, everyone should be practicing social distancing whether you are remote or on campus. The global pandemic COVID-19 has presented many moments of uncertainty, and together, we are navigating unprecedented challenges. As students enter a new week at Emory, beginning our new phase of remote learning, know that faculty, staff and administrators are here to offer support. Despite the distances that physically divide us, we are fully committed to ensuring your success and maintaining our bond as an academic community. For Emory, and the nation, this is an historic moment — a time defined by our collective efforts to maintain our educational mission and momentum as we work to help mitigate a global pandemic. Those are remarkable, worthy goals, and we believe this community is up to the challenge. Together, we are moving forward as educational pioneers. Our thanks goes out to everyone — students, faculty, staff and administrators — for all that you are doing, every day, to make that possible. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 21, 2020 9:13 AM Emory’s Transition to Remote Learning Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community: On Monday, March 23, life at Emory University will begin to look different. The Emory community will advance into our new phase of remote learning and — for many staff members — working remotely. While that will necessarily bring changes, it won’t deter our mission to create and share knowledge, and it will not break our sense of community. While the changes we are experiencing may feel isolating and even overwhelming, in a remarkable way they have also brought us closer together, as we navigate this shared experience. And there are parts of the Emory experience that will not change. Emory faculty remain among the very best in their fields, with the resources and creativity to deliver an exceptional learning experience. Our talented staff remain dedicated to our mission and service to our students. And the resiliency of our student body is inspiring. Thank you to everyone for your contributions to our community. For everyone, confronting COVID-19 requires a big adjustment. But as you grapple with new challenges, please know that you are not alone — resources are available, along with people eager to help, even from afar. We encourage everyone to prioritize their mental health and wellbeing in the coming days and weeks. If you are on campus or if you are at home, the following resources are available to you: Students: Counseling and Psychological Services and Oxford Counseling and Career Services Staff: Working Through COVID-19 and FSAP. And each day, please take time for self-care. Get some fresh air, take a walk, get some exercise —all of which can be accomplished while maintaining social distancing. We are impressed with the many ways our students are maintaining relationships across the miles, and are hard at work to provide additional opportunities to connect and maintain the heart of Emory, even at a distance. For those students, staff and faculty who must remain on campus, we ask you to continue exercising care and compassion by practicing social distancing. That includes avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people and remaining six feet apart at all times. Under these federal recommendations, parties and large social gatherings are discouraged at this time. To support security and social distancing measures, Emory’s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have made adjustments to operating structures, which include campus building closures and reduced hours of operation and summer program cancellations: Atlanta and Oxford Campus Building Security and Access Beginning Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and will only be accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. While most faculty, staff and students have active Emory ID cards that will permit access to their buildings, we anticipate some may not. Those who lack required building access should coordinate access with your department and the EmoryCard office. Questions may be directed to: emorycard@emory.edu. Additional information about pop-up EmoryCard Office access will be provided in a separate communication. Atlanta Campus Closed or Reduced Hours of Operation Currently closed: Woodruff P.E.

International Travel/Summer Study Abroad In keeping with the university’s indefinite suspension of international travel, Emory is canceling all Emory-sponsored undergraduate international travel for Summer 2020, including summer study abroad programs. Emory also encourages faculty and staff responsible for organizing any Summer 2020 Emory-sponsored international travel for graduate or professional students, either group or individual, to reconsider their plans, as such travel may not be allowed given the uncertain duration of the international travel suspension. This decision is being made in light of Emory’s international travel suspension and the possibility that planned summer travel could be disrupted by potential entry restrictions by the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, as Emory and its partners and colleagues abroad focus on their COVID-19 response, preparations that would normally be made to ensure safe and meaningful academic experiences abroad cannot be effectively executed. Students who have been planning Emory-sponsored travel should work with their units on any logistical or administrative issues resulting from this cancelation, such as the refund of paid deposits. Emory understands the importance of summer experiences abroad to students’ Emory program and remains committed to working with them to ensure academic continuity during this challenging time. As we continue to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic COVID-19 pandemic, we remain inspired and grateful for your help in facing change together. We encourage you to be patient next week with the faculty as we launch our courses remotely, with our staff as we implement new technology, and with each other as we find our new normal. The strength of our combined efforts today will go far in protecting the health and safety of everyone in the days to come. We can all play a role in helping turn the tide of this ongoing public health crisis. Thank you for doing your part. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 20, 2020 3:30 PM Oxford College: Getting Ready for Remote Learning Oxford College Students Dear Oxford College Students: As you prepare to transition to remote learning, Oxford College faculty and staff are doing the same. We have prepared FAQs to ready you for remote learning next week. You will certainly have many questions not addressed here. Your best source for up-to-date information from Emory University is our dedicated COVID-19 page. Please send specific questions about Oxford academics—classes, pre-registration, advising, and academic support—to the Oxford Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Please send general questions to OxfordDean@emory.edu for review and response. We are all finding new ways to help one another through these unprecedented times. Please know we are here to support you. Sincerely, Valerie Molyneaux</p>\n<p>Associate Dean for Academic Affairs</p>\n<p>Oxford College of Emory University 1. How do I resume class on Monday, March 23? Your faculty member for each individual class is scheduled to communicate with you by the end of the day on Thursday, March 19, 2020, about procedures for class. Some classes may be synchronous (real time as listed on OPUS, Eastern Standard Time). Others may be fully asynchronous (without real-time interaction). Some classes may have both synchronous and asynchronous elements. 2. What if I have not heard from my faculty member by the deadline? Please wait until the deadline has elapsed. Faculty may need every moment to prepare and communicate their plans for this major transition. After that, please contact Oxford College’s Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Valerie Molyneaux, for assistance (vmolyne@emory.edu). 3. How can I prepare for remote (online) learning? If you have not already done so, please complete the Oxford College remote learning survey. Oxford College Information Technology is using survey responses to support students who report access difficulties or barriers, so please complete the survey to allow us to support you through this period of remote learning. As possible, establish a secure internet connection. Gather trouble-shooting information, such as passwords and internet provider customer service contact information. Test your equipment, making sure that you can see and be seen through your camera, and hear and be heard through your speaker(s) and microphone. Zoom, Emory’s telecommunication platform, offers a test meeting site to check your equipment. Oxford also has resources and support for remote learning. Remote (online) learning will present new challenges. Daily log-ins to Canvas, even for asynchronous courses; close and careful reading of class communications (ideally on a computer screen, not just a phone); a regular study routine (ideally in a distraction-free space reserved for study); and connecting virtually with faculty and classmates can all help. 4. Can I use Oxford/Emory library materials? Access to Emory University databases, eJournals, and our large collection of digital books and reference tools will continue to be available online. Please see the Remote Library Resources and Services Guide for details about accessing these resources. Contact the Oxford Library at 770.784.8380, through email at ox-librarystaff@listserv.cc.emory.edu, or through the chat widget on the Oxford Library homepage. Please watch EaglePost for an announcement from your Oxford College Library about expanded access to online textbook/ course materials from select publishers. 5. How will I register for fall classes? Due to extended Spring Break, the timeline for Fall 2020 pre-registration has delayed one week. Official enrollment appointments will be updated by Wednesday, March 18 in OPUS. If you have questions about enrollment or registration, please contact the Advising Support Center (oxadvising@emory.edu). As of Tuesday, March 17, 2020, no changes or decisions have yet been announced regarding whether summer and future semesters will be offered remotely or in person. At this time, we are planning for regular operations; all updates will be communicated to students, faculty, and staff by the Office of the Provost. 6. How will I participate in academic advising? Rising second-year students (Oxford Class of 2021): work directly with your faculty advisor. If you have not heard from your advisor by March 27, 2020, please contact the Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Rising juniors/ graduating sophomores (Oxford Class of 2020): you have several advising options. Students who have declared a major in Emory College may receive separate communications from major departments. All Oxford students continuing to Emory College have a professional advisor in the Office for Undergraduate Education (Emory College’s equivalent to Oxford’s ASC); click here to find your advisor. Students continuing to the Goizueta Business School and School of Nursing, you will hear directly from the BBA and BSN programs about advising and registration procedures. Oxford faculty advisors and the ASC are always available to give general advice to rising juniors/ graduating sophomores as well. 7. Will I stay on track to graduate? Students will be provided equivalent opportunities to complete their current spring semester classes that they would have had during residential learning. 8. What happens to the accommodations I have on file through the Department of Accessibility Services? While the structure of an online course may eliminate the need for many typical classroom accommodations, the environment may also create a unique set of needed accommodations. Communicate with your faculty as soon as possible to understand how the change of instruction may affect your accommodations. Visit Accommodate for more information. The Department of Accessibility Services will remain open Monday-Friday, 8am – 5pm, EST. All student appointments will be conducted via phone or virtually until further notice. DAS will not proctor exams while remote instruction is in place. If you have any questions or concerns, please email the Oxford office: oas_oxford@emory.edu. 9. Is academic support still available? Yes, remotely! Please see details below.

As each day brings new challenges, we want to help students feel confident about maintaining their academic progress. We also recognize a hard truth: Emory undergraduate, graduate and professional students of various income levels and backgrounds may incur financial hardships as a result of COVID-19. In order to respond to these emerging needs and offer support to our students in crisis, Emory has established a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund which will be managed by Campus Life. More information about this new fund — and application guidelines — is anticipated to be released on Monday, March 23, 2020. In addition, students may request the option of satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading in place of a letter grade for a course or courses taken during the Spring 2020 term. Faculty members may also request that a graded course be changed to satisfactory/unsatisfactory based on changes related to the move to remote learning. Schools and colleges will review these requests and respond to them through school-based governance policies and committees, and additional information will be provided to you soon by your school. As always, we appreciate the flexibility and willingness to embrace these grading modifications that have been demonstrated by our faculty and students. As we move forward together in adapting to new learning styles, know that Emory will continue to seek ways to best support our community. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare</p>\n<p>March 18, 2020 6:06 PM Message from Dean Michael Elliott Emory College Students Message from Dean Michael Elliott I wanted to communicate with you directly about a few things that I am feeling and thinking as we approach the \"new normal\" of remote teaching.

It is with great sadness that I write to let you know we have made the difficult, but absolutely necessary decision, to cancel our traditional May commencement activities. However, I also want to share with you that planning already is underway to celebrate and commemorate the Class of 2020 as we are living in an extraordinary time. We did not make this decision lightly. I recognize that it will cause disappointment, especially for our graduates and their loved ones. But cancellation of the on-campus activities is, at present, the one option that ensures the safety and well-being of our Emory community members. We must be proactive in our mitigation efforts against COVID-19. Nevertheless, I apologize that we will not have our regular graduation celebrations, and wanted to let you know as soon as possible to help you with your plans. Thankfully, cancellation will not be the last word. Together, we will recognize all that you have accomplished and celebrate your creativity, resilience, and resolve. I wish you great success as you move forward into the next phase of your lives. I appreciate your patience and continued understanding as we navigate these challenges. Most of all, I encourage each member of the Emory community to continue to care for yourselves and your families during these very stressful times. We will remain guided by our mission of putting knowledge to work in the service of all humanity. The present times call for compassion and for courage. With gratitude, Claire E. Sterk</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 4:00 PM Guidance for LGS Student Research &#x26; Academic Progress Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Dear LGS Community, As you are aware, Emory University is taking extraordinary steps to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. I write to provide guidance on what this means for LGS. All LGS students should begin working remotely immediately, to the fullest extent possible, with transitions completed no later than Friday, March 20, 2020. Faculty advisors should work with their graduate students to develop individualized plans to continue their research remotely. All LGS students who currently receive stipends, including those supported by research grants, will continue to receive their stipends. LGS students should not be assigned as essential lab personnel with on-campus responsibilities. No student may be compelled to come to campus for any purpose.Faculty must be flexible to support remote work arrangements for LGS students. In the event that a laboratory engaged in essential research activities requires an LGS student to maintain a physical presence in the lab, this must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director, the PI’s Department Chair, and the Dean of the Laney Graduate School. The resulting decision will be reported to the PI’s School/Unit Dean. LGS will provide additional guidance and update the FAQs on the LGS COVID-19 webpage. LGS will work closely with graduate programs to mitigate the impact on student academic progress in order to meet the academic needs of each student. We recognize that transitioning certain kinds of research activities to remote work will require careful planning and may affect academic progress. We will provide further guidance as the implications for the research environment continue to unfold. If you have questions or concerns about academic progress, please reach out to your Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director. Students outside of lab environments should contact Interim Assistant Dean Mackenzie Bristow. Students in lab environments should contact Associate Dean Amanda Marie James. Directors of Graduate Studies/Program Directors should contact Senior Associate Dean Cathryn Johnson. During these rapidly evolving circumstances, we must work together and stay connected to protect our community. We appreciate your partnership and efforts to keep our community safe. Please regularly check the Emory University and LGS COVID-19 webpages for more information. Stay strong and resolute in your practices to curtail and stop transmission. Be patient and responsibly flexible and take time for self-care.</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 11:14 AM Emory’s Commitment to our Community Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, To strengthen our investment of support for students, faculty and staff during a time of unprecedented disruption, Emory leadership will provide a series of financial initiatives, which are as follows: Refund of Unused Fee Emory will refund student accounts with a calculated amount of unused housing, dining, athletic fees, activity fees, parking fees, and other fees unrelated to academic instruction. Since instruction will continue, no instructional costs will be reimbursed (tuition, technology fees, etc.) Other services that will remain available to students, such as health related fees, will also not be refunded. Federal Work Study Income Replacement The Department of Education has authorized the payment of unutilized Federal Work Study funds to each impacted student. The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) has reviewed the funds available and is in the process of calculating the amount eligible under this program, to be awarded to eligible students in the next week. High Financial Need Student Support Stipend We understand that Emory undergraduate students with the highest financial need will experience the greatest impact associated with the expedited closure of the resident halls and shift in academic delivery. With that in mind, Emory will provide an immediate “Student Support Stipend” to eligible undergraduate students in the amount of $1,000 within the next week. Students will be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid. Student Employee Salary Replacement Emory students of various income levels and backgrounds hold jobs at Emory and are classified as student employees. These jobs may be administrative, research focused, athletic support or various other activities. The rate of pay is different for each student employee and the hours may vary by job as well as by week-to-week availability, depending upon the student’s academic load and the unit’s need. We are concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the financial well-being of these students who depend on this income in their financial planning. As a means of supporting our student employees as the university moves to remote work and students are leaving campus, we propose to pay estimated earnings for the remaining weeks of the term based on their historical time worked. Students may check with their hiring unit to see if it is possible to continue to work remotely and may be paid for that time as well. Emory Employees Pay and Compensation We are making the commitment that regular faculty and staff employed by Emory University will be paid as usual for the current anticipated duration of the social distancing protocols, no matter their role within Emory and the altered learning/working environment. The process and details are still in development, but we are committed to continuation of pay from Emory during this time of uncertainty. Emory’s administration is committed to our students’ health and well-being, and we are dedicated to supporting their educational journeys with creativity and innovation as they progress along chosen academic pathways. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 16, 2020 7:20 PM Emory Update and Resources Especially for You Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students Dear Parents and Families, Here at Emory, students have always been our most important priority. And so it is natural that we share your deepest concerns for their success and wellbeing. Amid these uncertain times, that’s one reason we are committed to open communication that provides accurate, up-to-date information. A few days ago, we notified the Emory community that two undergraduate students staying at Dobbs Hall and the Clairmont campus were being tested for possible COVID-19. While awaiting test results, the students self-isolated in off-campus housing provided by the university. Today, we can report that both students have tested negative; they will remain in off-campus housing until other arrangements can be made. A third Emory student who lives off campus was tested for possible COVID-19, and has also tested negative. On March 16, two undergraduate students residing at Emory Point tested positive for COVID-19. Both students are in satisfactory condition and are self-isolating in their off-campus apartment. The students, who had left campus for spring break, have not been on the Emory University campus for more than a week; they did not report feeling ill until they returned from the break. Please be assured that Emory’s student health services and other environmental safety personnel interview all individuals within the campus community who test positive for COVID-19. Those interviews not only determine a patient’s contacts and activities, they help guide the university in taking action to safeguard the community’s health. Emory will update the public on COVID-19-specific updates and information via the Emory COVID-19 website, “Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community.” When the spread of COVID-19 was first reported in the U.S., Emory increased the frequency and intensity of its cleaning regime in all areas of the university, focusing on commons areas such as bathrooms, dining facilities and meeting rooms. If students or other members of the university community are tested for COVID-19 –– as with our two undergraduate students who were tested on March 14 — their rooms and workspaces will be cleaned and disinfected as detailed above. We have been advising students to leave campus and, if possible, return to their homes. We understand that it is not possible for all, so Emory is prepared to provide support to those who are unable to relocate and have been granted an exemption. All other students must move out of the residence halls by March 22 at 5 p.m. If you are concerned about traveling to campus to help your student move out, please know that the university can pack and ship belongings or store them locally for your student. We can also make arrangements for you and your student to move out during non-peak hours. For those students who cannot leave campus, Student Health Services will remain open. At this time, our care model will be a hybrid of virtual assessment and in-person visits. In order to manage the volume and protect the health of our patients and caregivers, Student Health Services will identify via phone the best course to seek treatment for those who feel unwell. Students with urgent concerns should call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 or Oxford Student Health Services at 770-784-8376. In the event of severe symptoms, including shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or chest pain, they should call 911 directly. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are working to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to partner closely with local and state agencies to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19.

We thank you for your patience as we continue to navigate this evolving situation. There are a lot of factors at play and we are working to resolve concerns as they arise. In this email we will begin to answer several questions that have been raised in regard to your academics directly with us or through your representatives on College Council.</p>\n<p>Fall 2020 Pre-Registration Pre-Registration will be delayed one week for all undergraduate schools. The new schedule is attached, and we have adjusted your registration appointments accordingly. Appointment times will remain the same, only the date has been amended. These times, which are all in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), should be viewable in OPUS now.</p>\n<p>If you have an advising appointment with a faculty member this week, please confirm with them if this will go ahead or if they would like to postpone your appointment. Faculty are working hard on revising course syllabi so please be flexible. Class Management &#x26; Faculty Expectations Individual instructors will provide you with exact details on course arrangements no later than 5 p.m. EDT on Thursday, March 19. We want to be clear with you regarding teaching expectations from the administration: Synchronous classes will meet at their regularly scheduled time, just in a remote format.</p>\n<p>Some course content may be delivered in an asynchronous format, or a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions. Each delivery method offers different learning opportunities for students that the other method could not provide. Students should expect that faculty will offer this combination.</p>\n<p>Faculty are expected to continue offering regular instruction, assessment and feedback throughout the duration of the semester.</p>\n<p>Faculty are expected to offer office hours through a virtual platform. You should confirm the times/availability of these directly with your faculty.</p>\n<p>Experiential Courses (labs, research, performance courses, internships, etc.) are under review. While you will be unable to continue these courses on campus, your instructors/coordinators are working hard to translate these into a suitable remote format. Some instructors have already provided information about alternative activities; others are working to develop options. More information will be provided as it becomes available. If any of the arrangements communicated by your instructors pose significant difficulties to you (e.g. time differences, lack of reliable internet), please reach out to them and explain your concerns. Faculty are prepared to work with you as best as they can. Technology Access If you do not have access to a computer or are concerned about regular internet access in your home location, please also reach out to OUE directly at oue.advising@emory.edu.

Here is our pledge: As Emory enters this next chapter, we will strive to stay connected, maintaining our essential bond. Even though our community may not be together physically for an unforeseen time, we are committed to moving forward together, united in spirit and service and preserving the care and compassion that have long been a hallmark of this university. That is foundational to who we are as a community, and it will not change. Over the past 24 hours, we’ve understandably received many questions — concerns about housing, remote learning and working, and especially how to best help the Emory community, particularly our students. Many answers to those questions will be updated daily at Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, a website dedicated to our response to COVID-19. It is heartening to be joined by the broader Emory community in our commitment to serving our students. In fact, it’s been moving to see just how quickly support can coalesce. Even as students began packing to leave campus, the Emory Student Government Association was distributing free MARTA passes to help with transportation. We’ve seen staff members working long hours to assist students with specific needs, faculty rapidly developing online lesson plans, and caring alumni who’ve stepped forward to volunteer their help. That outpouring of support has been heartwarming and, of course, not unexpected. For those who are able and eager to help, please consider contributing to the student hardship fund . In addition, the faculty and staff hardship fund offers assistance to other members of our campus community who might be impacted by COVID-19. Moving forward, perhaps one of the most important things we can all do is stay strong and healthy for each other — for our communities, our families and our friends. Let’s work to preserve those connections, our fundamental human bonds. Amid these remarkable times, let us prove what a community can be. Together, we will be stronger for it.</p>\n<p>In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

With that in mind, we wanted to notify our community that two Emory University students in undergraduate housing are being tested for possible COVID-19. Neither case has been confirmed but, out of an abundance of caution, both students are self-isolating in off-campus housing provided by the university. The Emory community will be notified if one or both students test positive. The undergraduates live in Dobbs Hall and at the Clairmont Campus, respectively. Their roommates have been notified and are being supported by student health services staff. The students’ rooms have been cleaned and disinfected by Emory Environmental Health and Safety personnel. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are taking action around-the-clock to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to work closely with local and state partners to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19. We understand that the uncertainty and quickly changing dynamic around COVID-19 can bring stress and anxiety. Emory is committed to keeping our community informed and to provide as many resources as possible. Many of these resources and key updates can be found at Emory’s COVID-19 website. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases in Georgia and across the country, students should self-assess for fever or cough. Students who develop symptoms need to separate themselves from others and call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 (Clifton Rd. campus), or Oxford College Student Services at 770-784-8376. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

We are all disappointed about the need to transition to remote learning and, for many employees, remote working. But we are all dedicated to making the changes necessary to keep each other safe as we continue with the vital mission of the university “to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity,” which is needed now more than ever. Already, you are showing the strength and service that defines the Emory community. Students are reaching out to support each other. Faculty are coming together to adapt their courses for remote learning and plan how they will continue their research. At every level of the university, staff members are going the extra mile to make sure that everyone receives the information and resources they need for our community to continue to thrive even in the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Some of you may be frustrated or anxious in the face of these unprecedented circumstances for you, your family, the university and our broader community. Please know that we are working to answer your questions as quickly and thoroughly as possible in a rapidly evolving situation. Please visit our dedicated website, Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, daily for newly updated information and answers to common questions on topics ranging from health and support resources to classes, housing, travel, events, finances and other logistics as we all make this transition together. Please note especially the information on travel and events. In the coming days, we know that the Emory community will remain strong and connected by our common purpose, even if we are no longer together in person on our campuses. Beyond your courses or work assignments, continue to reach out to each other by phone or video to sustain our networks of care and compassion.

Emory has now indefinitely suspended all official and previously authorized international travel and is strongly urging our campus community to postpone all university-sponsored domestic travel. Please view Emory’s latest travel restrictions here. We are continuing to monitor the situation and observe all guidance from Emory related to the Coronavirus. We will reopen the program when University directives advise that it is safe to do so. We do not know when that will be. Please continue to collect the necessary materials to apply for PDS funds once the program reopens. We intend to provide enhanced access to PDS funds at that time. During the PDS program suspension period, we will adjust the window for submitting follow-up documentation and reports. For trips/projects that have occurred during February and March 2020, you will now have up to 60 days from the end date to submit these items. Like many other disruptions related to the Coronavirus, this guidance may interfere with your professional plans in the coming months. We are very grateful for your patience and understanding. If you have any specific questions, please direct them to lgs.profdev@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 13, 2020 10:15 AM Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Extended Spring Break As a reminder, Emory University will extend spring break for students until Sunday, March 22, 2020. During this time, no in-person or remote classes should take place. The University will transition to remote learning beginning Monday, March 23. Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Qualifying examinations and thesis and dissertation defenses may take place on campus as scheduled. However, meetings should limit in-person participation to committee members only and options for remote participation must be offered. If desired, public participation may be arranged via remote connection. We strongly advise meeting participants who are considered at higher risk to participate remotely. Please consider social distancing and respiratory hygiene best practices for all meetings. For the remainder of the term, approval forms should be submitted electronically and include scanned signatures. Emory Zoom is recommended and useful for the practices above. Emory’s Teaching and Learning Technologies provides workshops, practice sessions, and instruction videos. Please submit any questions about defenses and exams to Ulf Nilsson at unilsso@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 12, 2020 1:00 PM Oxford Housing Move Out/Stay Request Form Oxford College Students Hello Oxford College Students, This communication is an outline to help you with planning next steps as a result of Emory University’s response to COVID-19. Emory University is taking steps to limit the spread of the virus. Students are expected to move out of Emory residential facilities by Sunday, March 22, at 5 PM. This was a difficult decision for the University, but the overall health and well-being of our students, faculty, staff and surrounding community is our priority. We understand that this news impacts each of you in different ways, and we will be here to support you over the coming days. As you prepare for the upcoming transition and begin packing your belongings, we will ensure you have supplies. We will provide moving bins, trash bags and other moving supplies, as well as information about storage options. You will receive more details in the coming days about these resources and move-out procedures. We will consider limited exceptions to allow certain students to remain on campus and provide support for those students who may need assistance with packing. We will review these requests as soon as possible on a case-by-case basis. Exceptions may include: Students who will have difficulty returning to their home country based on governmental travel restrictions due to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Students with demonstrated financial hardship or who are housing insecure.</p>\n<p>Students who are unable to return to Atlanta to pack their belongings All students must complete the Move Out/Stay Request Form by Monday, March 16 at 5:00 p.m. Students who are permitted to stay on campus will be required to relocate to a different residential space. Services will be limited, including access to many facilities, recreation and dining. We know how disappointing it is for you to receive this notification and the disruption it will cause to our community. With the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasizing the importance of taking active measures to contain spread of the virus in communities and mitigate risk to vulnerable populations in their communities, we believe it is the best decision at this time.

And what a sweeping transition it has been — from adjusting to new virtual classroom experiences to expanded responsibilities at home, balancing work with the challenges of homeschooling our children or caring for loved ones as we shelter in place. While these changes are necessary to fight COVID-19, they aren’t always easy. Social isolation and physical distancing is hard. Working long hours amid looming economic uncertainties is trying. Being forced to abruptly develop a new way of teaching and learning mid-semester has been a challenge. Please know that you are not alone. At Emory, we recognize the many adjustments you face and feel the stress of those changes, too. We also have the resources and ability to help, even in this new age of physical distancing. Undergraduate and graduate students should know that Emory’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is offering telehealth clinical services, where you can speak with a counselor or talk with a member of a triage team who can make assessments and help guide next steps. CAPS is also offering virtual workshops at 2 p.m. on Friday afternoons via Zoom to help manage stress, anxiety and feelings of social isolation. In addition, a series of peer-led virtual discussion groups begins April 13 to address academics, concerns about the future, home life and feelings of loneliness. Learn more about CAPS services during COVID-19. Student Health Services is offering telehealth appointments for both COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 related health questions. To learn more, please visit Campus Life. For faculty and staff who may need emotional support, the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) offers free and confidential services to help promote emotional, behavioral and organizational health. To support the increasing needs of our faculty, staff, physicians, trainees and their families throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, FSAP now offers tele-mental health services through telephonic and video-conferencing sessions and consultations. Videoconferencing services are conducted through a HIPAA-compliant Zoom platform. To learn more about the emotional support services offered by FSAP or to find help for you or a family member, please contact FSAP at 404-727-WELL (9355), efsap@emory.edu, or www.fsap.emory.edu. FSAP also offers a range of educational webinars and group support sessions focused on leadership and team services, addressing topics that range from stress management strategies and tips for healthy remote working to resilience and conflict management coaching. For more information about working through the COVID-19 pandemic, Emory Human Resources has launched a dedicated website offering guidance, support and tips for the unique challenges we now face, whether it’s balancing work and family life, learning how to work remotely, taking care of ourselves, or figuring out how to get bills paid. Usha Rackliffe, associate professor of practice at Emory’s Goizueta Business School, consolidated publicly available resources that we have added to the COVID-19 site to help students, faculty and staff access information and resources, including information on mortgage payments, student loans, rent, taxes and credit cards to help our community get the help that we need during this unprecedented time. Knowing where to find reliable, accessible support along the way can help in managing challenging times, and we encourage you to explore and take advantage of the resources available to you. Throughout the journey, Emory stands with you.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Honor Council Reminder The Emory College Honor Council would like to remind students that while you are completing coursework remotely, the Honor Code is still in effect. Be cautious as you interact and collaborate with others, or when you discuss or share your own work or the work of others. Please take a moment to review the Emory College Honor Code’s Appendix 3: Academic Misconduct in the Remote Learning Environment. Be mindful as you navigate remote teaching and learning as the new normal for the remainder of the semester. Most importantly, if you are in doubt about whether your actions may be problematic, you should contact your professor directly for clarification. Pre-Registration Pre-Registration continues this week for Emory College students. This week, students with 45+ earned hours will enroll. Please note that earned hours only includes courses that you have already completed. Hours that you are currently enrolled in this semester are NOT included in this count. In preparation for pre-registration we encourage you to: Review your enrollment times in OPUS Schedule an advising appointment with your major or pre-major faculty advisor. If you are not sure who your advisor is, their name and email address can be found in OPUS. Visit the University Course Atlas to explore courses for the Fall 2020 semester With pre-registration underway, here is part 2 of our Cool Courses feature. This feature is designed to highlight interesting opportunities, open to Emory College students, for credit. These are courses which typically have no pre-requisites. BUS 499: Design Thinking Do you want to learn a powerful approach for developing practical, creative solutions to real-world, messy, wicked problems? At its core, design thinking uses the mindset and methods of design practitioners to identify and address human needs by developing functional and emotionally meaningful products, services, processes, and spaces that address those needs. This highly experiential course, taught by Prof Jan Barton, is open to all Emory students, regardless of degree or major. Through short lectures and guided teamwork, you will learn a design thinking framework and a set of tools to help you navigate ambiguity, improve your ability to empathize with others, integrate diverse preferences and points of view, reframe challenges, ideate creative solutions, develop a “just-try-it” mindset for rapid experimentation, and enhance your presentation skills with storytelling and graphic design elements. You will showcase your learning in a final project addressing one of Emory’s current strategic challenges. REL 200R: LGBTQ Religion &#x26; Spirituality Rather than asking what religious traditions say about sexuality and gender, this course will focus on what LGBTQ-identified people have had to say about religion and spirituality, exploring their cultural agency and creativity. Here are a few examples of topics we will explore: the identification of the assassinated gay activist and politician, Harvey Milk, as \"Saint Harvey Milk\" by some LGBTQ people; lesbian feminist embodied goddess spirituality; the Radical Faeries movement; the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence order of \"queer nuns\"; the spiritual dimensions of Native American \"Two-Spirit\" identities; LGBTQ-affirming expressions of Pentecostal Christianity; LGBTQ atheism. The course will include site-visits, participant observation in cultural events, and guest speakers representing a variety of groups and communities.</p>\n<p>April 6, 2020 10:54 AM Emory’s Commitment to Belonging Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory community, Emory University’s motto — the wise heart seeks knowledge — underscores one of our key institutional principles: Our work here is driven by the heart. Care and compassion are essential to our mission of education and service. These values have proven crucial in guiding our response to the coronavirus pandemic. Emory has long strived to create a community of belonging. Within that charge, we recognize the importance of standing together during difficult times to support and encourage one another. Across the nation and the world, however, fears over COVID-19 have sometimes erupted into anger and accusations, racism and xenophobia. Globally, reports of anti-Asian bias and blatant harassment have been on the increase. Sadly, these behaviors have even been directed at frontline health care workers in hospitals throughout the U.S. as they work to treat patients, save lives and serve the public — all under incredibly stressful conditions. And our students, while pursuing their education and resuming their lives, have not been spared from the hate. As we find our way forward, let us not forget our essential Emory values. Mean-spirited, untruthful, socially stigmatizing remarks, slurs and actions do not represent who we are as a community. In fact, they stand in direct opposition to our most foundational principles. Simply put, there is no room for hate at Emory. Please know that bias and harassment within our community will not be tolerated. Indeed, harassment of any person or group of persons on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap or veteran’s status is a form of discrimination specifically prohibited by university policy. If members of the Emory community encounter such behaviors, on or off campus, we want to hear from you. For more information and support, please contact the Emory University Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at 404-727-9867 or oei@emory.edu. We recognize that harassment takes many forms. Some members of the Emory community have recently reported encountering incidents of “Zoombombing” — instances of uninvited guests crashing online Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars in order to shout slurs and share offensive materials. While Zoom has options to combat such intrusions, Emory’s Library and Information Technology Services (LITS) team recommends that those concerned with unwanted intrusions should require meeting passwords or, for smaller meetings, use a “waiting room.” For step-by-step guidance, please visit here. Additional questions may be directed to videoservices@emory.edu. Spreading inaccurate information can too easily lead to scapegoating and other forms of disrespect, particularly aimed at persons of Asian descent. During this challenging time, we also urge members of the Emory community to seek out factual information, consulting official and evidence-based sources. For accurate information and updates on how the coronavirus is impacting Emory, please visit COVID-19 updates. At Emory, we all have a role in building our community of belonging aided by members who are respectful of one another and find value in the richness and complexity of our shared diversity. Our inability to be physically present with one another offers an opportunity for us to demonstrate support for each other and to form an even deeper connection to our core values. Now more than ever, let us celebrate our Emory values and strengthen our fundamental bond, affirming the dignity and humanity of each other through our words and actions. Though apart, we remain, as always, in community.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>April 3, 2020 4:30 PM Preventing Zoombombing Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Some Emory community members have reported incidents of “Zoombombing” where uninvited guests crash their Zoom meetings, classrooms and webinars, and sometimes share upsetting or offensive content using the screen share option. Tips for preventing Zoombombing To avoid having your Zoom meetings interrupted, take the following precautions: Do not share Zoom links on social media or external facing websites; only communicate your Zoom links through email or other secure means.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, add a Password, which you would then communicate to your participants. They will be prompted to enter the password any time they attempt to enter the meeting room.</p>\n<p>In your meeting settings, enable a Waiting Room. This means you have to manually allow in any of your participants. Be sure to keep an eye on the waiting room, and click “admit” in the participant window to allow people in. Encouraging participants to enter the room with their full name will help you keep track of them. If you have a second meeting leader, this is a great job for them, so that you can lead the meeting and someone else can manage the participant list.</p>\n<p>While in the room, you can also limit the screen sharing capacity just to the host. This will not work if your participants need to share their screens, but if they do not, follow these steps to limit the sharing. Be sure to take the time to familiarize yourself with Zoom’s settings and features so you understand how to protect your virtual space when you need to. Resources LITS has tips and advice on Zoom settings to avoid Zoombombing.</p>\n<p>The Emory Police Department also has some helpful tips. What to do if you experience Zoombombing If you are hosting a Zoom call with an Emory-sponsored Zoom account and the call gets Zoombombed, please report the incident to the Emory Police Department by calling 404.727.6111 (TDD/TTY 404.320.1024) or by reporting the incident via LiveSafe.</p>\n<p>April 2, 2020 2:01 PM Change to S/U Option Emory College Students Today we are announcing changes to the S/U grading basis plan, which now includes an extended deadline and petition option. We want to share more information on how these changes will affect Emory College students specifically. Changes to S/U Grading Option We will extend the current S/U change deadline until April 27 (the last day of class for this semester).</p>\n<p>the current S/U change deadline until (the last day of class for this semester).

Withdrawal Petition is available until April 10</p>\n<p>Extended Withdrawal Deadline (for First-Year, Oxford and Transfer students) is April 3</p>\n<p>Incompletes may be requested in discussion with your academic advisor through April 27. We have been listening to the concerns that students have raised that S/U grades may put them in less competitive positions without a universal mandate. We especially appreciate the desire expressed in an on-line petition, and elsewhere, to protect the most vulnerable members of our student community. At the same time, we understand that many students want to pursue letter grades this semester. Please be assured that these issues are happening across higher education, and graduate and medical schools will all be aware of the extraordinary circumstances facing students in Spring 2020. In weighing the different grading possibilities for this semester, we have worked to understand and meet the different needs of our students as they seek to continue their academic careers during the distress of this global health crisis. There is no grading system that does not involve some tradeoff, and we recognize that no system will address all the concerns of all of our students. We know that this semester is an extraordinary one, and we want to assure everyone that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to help our students thrive during a challenging time. For questions or concerns about grading policies and practices, students should contact oue.advising@emory.edu</p>\n<p>Best wishes, Shari Obrentz, Associate Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Dan Dillard, Assistant Dean, Office for Undergraduate Education Steve Savage, Associate Director of Communications, Office for Undergraduate Education</p>\n<p>March 30, 2020 5:00 PM Emory Together with Laney Alumni Graduate Students Dear Friends, Across our communities, at Emory, and in our homes with family and friends, we are all experiencing circumstances that we would never imagine. I want you to know that I am thinking of you and your loved ones and hope that you are safe and well. At the onset of the global public health crisis and continuing as long as it is needed, Emory is taking extraordinary steps to safeguard the health and well-being of the campus community. On March 23, the University transitioned to remote learning and remote work for our students, faculty, and staff. We will closely monitor and assess next steps as this situation continues to evolve. I am so very proud of how our students, faculty, and staff at Emory University and in Emory Healthcare are working together to address the needs of our communities. We need each other now more than ever. The impact of COVID-19 has created logistical and financial implications for many members of our communities. Emory is working to provide support in various ways and has launched the EmoryTogether Fund to assist with emergency needs. The added support of our alumni and donors will amplify efforts to provide funds for food, housing, health, travel, remote learning, family, and other COVID-19-related expenses. Here's how you can help. If you are able, please donate to the EmoryTogether Fund and join us in response to this pandemic. Alumni play an essential role in all that we do at Emory. We need your help now to ensure the continued progress and success of our students. We value your partnership and ask that you join with the Laney Graduate School to help students navigate these trying times with minimal disruption to their academic progress. Thank you again for your continued support of our students and the Laney Graduate School. Please stay safe and stay hopeful. With you, with great appreciation, -Lisa Lisa A.

As our community has shifted to distance learning and remote work in many areas, and the rate of cases in Georgia rapidly increases, it has become clear that it will be difficult for Emory to maintain an accurate count of members of our community who are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. For this reason, we have revised our approach to reporting confirmed cases and will no longer send announcements about illnesses on campus. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 in Georgia or Metro Atlanta, please refer to the Georgia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19 tracking. Our commitment to the health and safety of our community is unwavering as we continue to work closely with local and state health partners to monitor and manage COVID-19 and address its impact on our community. Leadership in Academic Affairs and Business Administration is currently working with schools and units to define essential activities on campus and provide guidance to both faculty and staff. We will focus our attention on around-the-clock actions to protect students, faculty, and staff who remain on campus. If your function is deemed essential and you are required to come to campus but feel you are in a high-risk group due to your age or a medical condition, please talk to your supervisor or HR representative for working options.

To best serve our students who requested to remain on campus this semester, and maintain important community bonds, we have brought students from our Oxford and Atlanta campuses together on Emory’s Clairmont campus, where we can provide each student residential single-room accommodations. Oxford students and their belongings were transported to their new accommodations by shuttles, which were staggered to support social distancing. Once settled, Oxford faculty and staff, along with Atlanta campus colleagues, will be available to continue to support all students remaining on campus throughout the semester. Our Oxford students traditionally transition to Atlanta after their sophomore year with strong bonds in place, ready to take on leadership positions at Emory University. These same students are being welcomed to their new homes earlier than anticipated on a campus that is eager for them to feel at home. Resources have been put in place to help them create a new kind of bond with their fellow students and professors at Emory College during this unprecedented time. Many thanks to our resilient Oxford College students for making this transition and also to the many dedicated staff members on both campuses who’ve helped support them throughout the move. We appreciate everyone’s patience as we continue to adapt to new challenges, and we wholeheartedly welcome Oxford to the Atlanta campus. In times of uncertainty, there is comfort in community. We’re grateful you are part of ours.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

From staff members who’ve helped Emory students move and kept a labyrinth of campus operations running smoothly to our remarkable, resilient faculty who’ve deftly transitioned to online learning platforms — and countless others — we thank you for your hard, ongoing work. Beginning this week, Emory Report is launching a series dedicated to shining a light on those critical efforts, exploring how our staff members are supporting the daily work of the university, laboring tirelessly behind the scenes to help advance our academic goals. We remain committed to supporting those members of our community who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. That extends to individuals who contribute to many facets of Emory’s operations and who are being significantly affected by changes brought by COVID-19. In recognition of those impacts, we have advocated on behalf of Bon Appetit workers to ensure they are protected from a sudden loss of earnings. Through this collaboration, the Bon Appetit employees who support both campuses will continue to receive their regular earnings and benefits through the end of the semester. Last week we announced a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund to support students. This week the Emory Together Fund was widened to cover faculty and staff experiencing direct challenges as a result of COVID-19. By helping meet their most pressing and immediate needs, the Emory Together Fund can give members of the Emory community the ability to overcome the difficult obstacles presented by COVID-19 and future emergencies. The Emory Together Fund includes a $50,000 matching challenge to encourage the Emory community to pitch in to help students, faculty, and staff address financial difficulties, like those presented by COVID-19. In the long-term, the Emory Together Fund will continue to provide financial resources to students, faculty, and staff of Emory University to overcome future challenges. More information, including an application form and guidelines for staff and faculty, is available on Emory’s Human Resources Emory Together Fund website. As we face the challenges of each new day, Emory will continue to honor our core values and mission, supporting our community and embracing our work with creativity, collaboration and commitment. Together, we are stronger.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Before providing some updates, I want to include a video Michael Elliott, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences filmed to communicate directly with you. If you are unable to view the video by clicking the image above, please view the video on youtube. Remote Teaching We began remote teaching this week. Your student will likely have attended their first online session. Our faculty are working hard to make this a great experience for your student. If your student has any issues with their course work, or connecting via remote technology, please ask them to reach out to their faculty members in the first instance. Course Grading Your student has received information on grading for this semester. We are offering students the option to change their grading basis from a letter grade to satisfactory/unsatisfactory, to petition for a late, single, course withdrawal without penalty or to request incomplete grades. Each option carries potential benefits and consequences and our advising team is available to meet virtually with students to discuss individual situations. We know that this is an unusual situation and we are working to offer practical solutions to the challenges we know that some students are facing. Commencement 2020 It is with great sorrow that the University has had to cancel our Commencement exercises in May 2020. I want to underscore that we are proud of all our graduating students and, as Dean Elliott noted in a message to them directly, will find a way to honor and celebrate all that they have accomplished at another time in the future. While those plans are still being formulated, we will keep your student updated. We look forward to celebrating them appropriately soon. As always, my team is available to answer any questions or concerns that you might have. You can reach them by emailing oue.advising@emory.edu Sincerely, Joanne Brzinski, Ph.D.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education</p>\n<p>Emory College of Arts and Sciences</p>\n<p>March 24, 2020 12:00 PM Support from Laney Edge and Professional Development &#x26; Career Planning Graduate Students Dear LGS Students, We hope that you are taking care of yourselves and remaining informed during this public health crisis.

That swift transition represents a cultural sea change from our normal academic routines and campus operations, and its success is due, in no small part, to each and every one of you. Congratulations on embracing the rapid changes necessary to keep our learning channels — and our community — strong, stable and functional. For some of us, learning and working online will be familiar. For others, it may represent a first-time experience. Together, we are making it work — every day, finding our way forward. And with each success, both large and small, our confidence and resolve is strengthened. We recognize that the rough edges of this transition have been smoothed by the dedication of many, many individuals, whose tireless, behind-the-scenes efforts have helped keep the very machinery of Emory humming. Our deepest thanks goes out to all Emory students, faculty and staff for the hard work, long hours and resilience you’ve demonstrated in going the extra mile to make this possible. It has been an extraordinary effort. As we continue adapting to change, an important reminder: For students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, starting this week all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. Amid these new developments, we also want to acknowledge important, long-standing traditions here at Emory. As we move together as a community through this spring semester — always a time of growth and renewal — we’re also preparing to welcome our newest cohort of student scholars, the Class of 2024. The evening of Wednesday, March 25, our final round of admitted first-year students will receive their eagerly awaited confirmation emails, inviting them to join the Emory community. It’s not hard for students to recall the anticipation you may have felt as a high school senior awaiting that notification as you decided where to enroll. We absolutely share in that excitement. We also want to recognize the important work being done by teams at the Office of Admission on the Atlanta campus and the Office of Enrollment Services on the Oxford campus to share admissions information with prospective Emory students. In the days ahead, those offices will continue working diligently to provide new remote opportunities for future Eagles to connect with current students, faculty, and staff. For the latest developments in our new normal together, we invite you to check out the recently relaunched Emory COVID-19 website, which now features information organized to provide quick answers for faculty, staff and students, including important resources for remote learning and working. Thank you for standing with Emory as we face our shared challenges — honoring the past, while building toward the future. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare</p>\n<p>March 23, 2020 1:09 PM LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis Graduate Students LGS Community, We write to follow up on the message from the Interim Provost Leadership Team to provide a process for requesting a change of grading basis from letter grade to S/U. We provide this added flexibility in recognition of the change to remote education, and your need to manage this in the context of broader efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. You can change the grading basis of one, some, or all of your courses, and you will have several weeks to make your decision. We encourage you to discuss this with your advisor, especially if you are considering this change for a required course. How to make a request: You can make requests now through April 10.</p>\n<p>Use this form: LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis to S/U. You will need to log in to the form using your Emory credentials.</p>\n<p>LGS Student Request to Change Grading Basis to S/U. To help us process requests in a timely and accurate manner, follow the steps below to identify the classes that should be changed: Log in to your OPUS account, click “Course Planning and Enrollment,” and then “View My Classes.” That screen will have the information you need to provide in the form: (1) course subject and number, and (2) class and section number. View a screenshot that details how this looks in OPUS for one course: course and subject number are in the red box (“MSCR 591”), and class and section (“5759 – Section 1”) are in the blue box.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, contact Tamika Hairston at tamika.hairston@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 23, 2020 8:56 AM Emory Together, We Transition Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, To help students remain focused on their educational goals, this week Emory University formally launches the EmoryTogether Fund — a $5 million fund designed to support our undergraduate, graduate and professional students facing financial hardships as a result of COVID-19. As we announced last week, the fund will help with the emergency financial needs of full and part-time degree-seeking students enrolled at Emory as of March 11, 2020, who demonstrate verifiable financial hardship related to COVID-19. Assistance may include help with a range of challenges associated with COVID-19, including basic needs (food, special housing circumstances, medicine, etc.), educational support needs (travel to a safe learning location, remote learning needs, etc.), and family/medical needs (job loss, medical deductible, etc.). Starting today, qualified students with direct COVID-19 related financial hardships are encouraged to apply for support through this fund, which will be available from March 23, 2020, through June 30, 2020. Applications should be submitted through the Finance website. Emory’s Division of Campus Life, working with an oversight committee, will review all applications in consideration of special requests. Emory employees, who are enrolled in degree programs, are not eligible for support through this fund but are encouraged to seek support through the Emory University Hardship Fund, which assists faculty and staff. A reminder for students, faculty and staff who remain on campus, beginning today, Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and only accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. To help everyone in the Emory community gain access to quick reliable information, we will relaunch the Emory COVID-19 website with specific areas for faculty, staff and students to obtain the necessary resources for remote learning/working, latest guidelines and campus operations. Lastly, everyone should be practicing social distancing whether you are remote or on campus. The global pandemic COVID-19 has presented many moments of uncertainty, and together, we are navigating unprecedented challenges. As students enter a new week at Emory, beginning our new phase of remote learning, know that faculty, staff and administrators are here to offer support. Despite the distances that physically divide us, we are fully committed to ensuring your success and maintaining our bond as an academic community. For Emory, and the nation, this is an historic moment — a time defined by our collective efforts to maintain our educational mission and momentum as we work to help mitigate a global pandemic. Those are remarkable, worthy goals, and we believe this community is up to the challenge. Together, we are moving forward as educational pioneers. Our thanks goes out to everyone — students, faculty, staff and administrators — for all that you are doing, every day, to make that possible. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 21, 2020 9:13 AM Emory’s Transition to Remote Learning Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community: On Monday, March 23, life at Emory University will begin to look different. The Emory community will advance into our new phase of remote learning and — for many staff members — working remotely. While that will necessarily bring changes, it won’t deter our mission to create and share knowledge, and it will not break our sense of community. While the changes we are experiencing may feel isolating and even overwhelming, in a remarkable way they have also brought us closer together, as we navigate this shared experience. And there are parts of the Emory experience that will not change. Emory faculty remain among the very best in their fields, with the resources and creativity to deliver an exceptional learning experience. Our talented staff remain dedicated to our mission and service to our students. And the resiliency of our student body is inspiring. Thank you to everyone for your contributions to our community. For everyone, confronting COVID-19 requires a big adjustment. But as you grapple with new challenges, please know that you are not alone — resources are available, along with people eager to help, even from afar. We encourage everyone to prioritize their mental health and wellbeing in the coming days and weeks. If you are on campus or if you are at home, the following resources are available to you: Students: Counseling and Psychological Services and Oxford Counseling and Career Services Staff: Working Through COVID-19 and FSAP. And each day, please take time for self-care. Get some fresh air, take a walk, get some exercise —all of which can be accomplished while maintaining social distancing. We are impressed with the many ways our students are maintaining relationships across the miles, and are hard at work to provide additional opportunities to connect and maintain the heart of Emory, even at a distance. For those students, staff and faculty who must remain on campus, we ask you to continue exercising care and compassion by practicing social distancing. That includes avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people and remaining six feet apart at all times. Under these federal recommendations, parties and large social gatherings are discouraged at this time. To support security and social distancing measures, Emory’s Atlanta and Oxford College campuses have made adjustments to operating structures, which include campus building closures and reduced hours of operation and summer program cancellations: Atlanta and Oxford Campus Building Security and Access Beginning Monday, March 23, all Atlanta and Oxford campus buildings will be secured and will only be accessible with an active Emory ID card. This security measure is necessary for protection of personnel and property as a result of changes to the campus operating environment due to COVID-19. While most faculty, staff and students have active Emory ID cards that will permit access to their buildings, we anticipate some may not. Those who lack required building access should coordinate access with your department and the EmoryCard office. Questions may be directed to: emorycard@emory.edu. Additional information about pop-up EmoryCard Office access will be provided in a separate communication. Atlanta Campus Closed or Reduced Hours of Operation Currently closed: Woodruff P.E. Center, Student Activity &#x26; Academic Center (excepting mail and dining), Emory Student Center, Alumni Memorial University Center, Schwartz Center for Performing Arts, Carlos Museum, Woodruff Library, Barnes &#x26; Noble</p>\n<p>Reduced hours: Dining hall hours will vary.

International Travel/Summer Study Abroad In keeping with the university’s indefinite suspension of international travel, Emory is canceling all Emory-sponsored undergraduate international travel for Summer 2020, including summer study abroad programs. Emory also encourages faculty and staff responsible for organizing any Summer 2020 Emory-sponsored international travel for graduate or professional students, either group or individual, to reconsider their plans, as such travel may not be allowed given the uncertain duration of the international travel suspension. This decision is being made in light of Emory’s international travel suspension and the possibility that planned summer travel could be disrupted by potential entry restrictions by the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, as Emory and its partners and colleagues abroad focus on their COVID-19 response, preparations that would normally be made to ensure safe and meaningful academic experiences abroad cannot be effectively executed. Students who have been planning Emory-sponsored travel should work with their units on any logistical or administrative issues resulting from this cancelation, such as the refund of paid deposits. Emory understands the importance of summer experiences abroad to students’ Emory program and remains committed to working with them to ensure academic continuity during this challenging time. As we continue to respond to the unprecedented impact of this historic COVID-19 pandemic, we remain inspired and grateful for your help in facing change together. We encourage you to be patient next week with the faculty as we launch our courses remotely, with our staff as we implement new technology, and with each other as we find our new normal. The strength of our combined efforts today will go far in protecting the health and safety of everyone in the days to come. We can all play a role in helping turn the tide of this ongoing public health crisis. Thank you for doing your part. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President for Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 20, 2020 3:30 PM Oxford College: Getting Ready for Remote Learning Oxford College Students Dear Oxford College Students: As you prepare to transition to remote learning, Oxford College faculty and staff are doing the same. We have prepared FAQs to ready you for remote learning next week. You will certainly have many questions not addressed here. Your best source for up-to-date information from Emory University is our dedicated COVID-19 page. Please send specific questions about Oxford academics—classes, pre-registration, advising, and academic support—to the Oxford Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Please send general questions to OxfordDean@emory.edu for review and response. We are all finding new ways to help one another through these unprecedented times. Please know we are here to support you. Sincerely, Valerie Molyneaux</p>\n<p>Associate Dean for Academic Affairs</p>\n<p>Oxford College of Emory University 1. How do I resume class on Monday, March 23? Your faculty member for each individual class is scheduled to communicate with you by the end of the day on Thursday, March 19, 2020, about procedures for class. Some classes may be synchronous (real time as listed on OPUS, Eastern Standard Time). Others may be fully asynchronous (without real-time interaction). Some classes may have both synchronous and asynchronous elements. 2. What if I have not heard from my faculty member by the deadline? Please wait until the deadline has elapsed. Faculty may need every moment to prepare and communicate their plans for this major transition. After that, please contact Oxford College’s Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Valerie Molyneaux, for assistance (vmolyne@emory.edu). 3. How can I prepare for remote (online) learning? If you have not already done so, please complete the Oxford College remote learning survey. Oxford College Information Technology is using survey responses to support students who report access difficulties or barriers, so please complete the survey to allow us to support you through this period of remote learning. As possible, establish a secure internet connection. Gather trouble-shooting information, such as passwords and internet provider customer service contact information. Test your equipment, making sure that you can see and be seen through your camera, and hear and be heard through your speaker(s) and microphone. Zoom, Emory’s telecommunication platform, offers a test meeting site to check your equipment. Oxford also has resources and support for remote learning. Remote (online) learning will present new challenges. Daily log-ins to Canvas, even for asynchronous courses; close and careful reading of class communications (ideally on a computer screen, not just a phone); a regular study routine (ideally in a distraction-free space reserved for study); and connecting virtually with faculty and classmates can all help. 4. Can I use Oxford/Emory library materials? Access to Emory University databases, eJournals, and our large collection of digital books and reference tools will continue to be available online. Please see the Remote Library Resources and Services Guide for details about accessing these resources. Contact the Oxford Library at 770.784.8380, through email at ox-librarystaff@listserv.cc.emory.edu, or through the chat widget on the Oxford Library homepage. Please watch EaglePost for an announcement from your Oxford College Library about expanded access to online textbook/ course materials from select publishers. 5. How will I register for fall classes? Due to extended Spring Break, the timeline for Fall 2020 pre-registration has delayed one week. Official enrollment appointments will be updated by Wednesday, March 18 in OPUS. If you have questions about enrollment or registration, please contact the Advising Support Center (oxadvising@emory.edu). As of Tuesday, March 17, 2020, no changes or decisions have yet been announced regarding whether summer and future semesters will be offered remotely or in person. At this time, we are planning for regular operations; all updates will be communicated to students, faculty, and staff by the Office of the Provost. 6. How will I participate in academic advising? Rising second-year students (Oxford Class of 2021): work directly with your faculty advisor. If you have not heard from your advisor by March 27, 2020, please contact the Advising Support Center (ASC) (oxadvising@emory.edu). Rising juniors/ graduating sophomores (Oxford Class of 2020): you have several advising options. Students who have declared a major in Emory College may receive separate communications from major departments. All Oxford students continuing to Emory College have a professional advisor in the Office for Undergraduate Education (Emory College’s equivalent to Oxford’s ASC); click here to find your advisor. Students continuing to the Goizueta Business School and School of Nursing, you will hear directly from the BBA and BSN programs about advising and registration procedures. Oxford faculty advisors and the ASC are always available to give general advice to rising juniors/ graduating sophomores as well. 7. Will I stay on track to graduate? Students will be provided equivalent opportunities to complete their current spring semester classes that they would have had during residential learning. 8. What happens to the accommodations I have on file through the Department of Accessibility Services? While the structure of an online course may eliminate the need for many typical classroom accommodations, the environment may also create a unique set of needed accommodations. Communicate with your faculty as soon as possible to understand how the change of instruction may affect your accommodations. Visit Accommodate for more information. The Department of Accessibility Services will remain open Monday-Friday, 8am – 5pm, EST. All student appointments will be conducted via phone or virtually until further notice. DAS will not proctor exams while remote instruction is in place. If you have any questions or concerns, please email the Oxford office: oas_oxford@emory.edu. 9. Is academic support still available? Yes, remotely! Please see details below. Writing Center The Writing Center will be open for individual online consultations from 2PM to 10PM EST, Sundays through Thursdays through the end of the semester. Consultations will take place through Google docs and Zoom. To make an appointment, visit oxford.mywconline.com.

As each day brings new challenges, we want to help students feel confident about maintaining their academic progress. We also recognize a hard truth: Emory undergraduate, graduate and professional students of various income levels and backgrounds may incur financial hardships as a result of COVID-19. In order to respond to these emerging needs and offer support to our students in crisis, Emory has established a $5 million EmoryTogether Fund which will be managed by Campus Life. More information about this new fund — and application guidelines — is anticipated to be released on Monday, March 23, 2020. In addition, students may request the option of satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading in place of a letter grade for a course or courses taken during the Spring 2020 term. Faculty members may also request that a graded course be changed to satisfactory/unsatisfactory based on changes related to the move to remote learning. Schools and colleges will review these requests and respond to them through school-based governance policies and committees, and additional information will be provided to you soon by your school. As always, we appreciate the flexibility and willingness to embrace these grading modifications that have been demonstrated by our faculty and students. As we move forward together in adapting to new learning styles, know that Emory will continue to seek ways to best support our community.

It is with great sadness that I write to let you know we have made the difficult, but absolutely necessary decision, to cancel our traditional May commencement activities. However, I also want to share with you that planning already is underway to celebrate and commemorate the Class of 2020 as we are living in an extraordinary time. We did not make this decision lightly. I recognize that it will cause disappointment, especially for our graduates and their loved ones. But cancellation of the on-campus activities is, at present, the one option that ensures the safety and well-being of our Emory community members. We must be proactive in our mitigation efforts against COVID-19. Nevertheless, I apologize that we will not have our regular graduation celebrations, and wanted to let you know as soon as possible to help you with your plans. Thankfully, cancellation will not be the last word. Together, we will recognize all that you have accomplished and celebrate your creativity, resilience, and resolve. I wish you great success as you move forward into the next phase of your lives. I appreciate your patience and continued understanding as we navigate these challenges. Most of all, I encourage each member of the Emory community to continue to care for yourselves and your families during these very stressful times. We will remain guided by our mission of putting knowledge to work in the service of all humanity. The present times call for compassion and for courage. With gratitude, Claire E. Sterk</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 4:00 PM Guidance for LGS Student Research &#x26; Academic Progress Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Dear LGS Community, As you are aware, Emory University is taking extraordinary steps to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. I write to provide guidance on what this means for LGS. All LGS students should begin working remotely immediately, to the fullest extent possible, with transitions completed no later than Friday, March 20, 2020. Faculty advisors should work with their graduate students to develop individualized plans to continue their research remotely. All LGS students who currently receive stipends, including those supported by research grants, will continue to receive their stipends. LGS students should not be assigned as essential lab personnel with on-campus responsibilities. No student may be compelled to come to campus for any purpose.Faculty must be flexible to support remote work arrangements for LGS students. In the event that a laboratory engaged in essential research activities requires an LGS student to maintain a physical presence in the lab, this must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director, the PI’s Department Chair, and the Dean of the Laney Graduate School. The resulting decision will be reported to the PI’s School/Unit Dean. LGS will provide additional guidance and update the FAQs on the LGS COVID-19 webpage. LGS will work closely with graduate programs to mitigate the impact on student academic progress in order to meet the academic needs of each student. We recognize that transitioning certain kinds of research activities to remote work will require careful planning and may affect academic progress. We will provide further guidance as the implications for the research environment continue to unfold. If you have questions or concerns about academic progress, please reach out to your Director of Graduate Studies/Program Director. Students outside of lab environments should contact Interim Assistant Dean Mackenzie Bristow. Students in lab environments should contact Associate Dean Amanda Marie James. Directors of Graduate Studies/Program Directors should contact Senior Associate Dean Cathryn Johnson. During these rapidly evolving circumstances, we must work together and stay connected to protect our community. We appreciate your partnership and efforts to keep our community safe. Please regularly check the Emory University and LGS COVID-19 webpages for more information. Stay strong and resolute in your practices to curtail and stop transmission. Be patient and responsibly flexible and take time for self-care.</p>\n<p>March 17, 2020 11:14 AM Emory’s Commitment to our Community Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff Dear Emory Community, To strengthen our investment of support for students, faculty and staff during a time of unprecedented disruption, Emory leadership will provide a series of financial initiatives, which are as follows: Refund of Unused Fee Emory will refund student accounts with a calculated amount of unused housing, dining, athletic fees, activity fees, parking fees, and other fees unrelated to academic instruction. Since instruction will continue, no instructional costs will be reimbursed (tuition, technology fees, etc.) Other services that will remain available to students, such as health related fees, will also not be refunded. Federal Work Study Income Replacement The Department of Education has authorized the payment of unutilized Federal Work Study funds to each impacted student. The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) has reviewed the funds available and is in the process of calculating the amount eligible under this program, to be awarded to eligible students in the next week. High Financial Need Student Support Stipend We understand that Emory undergraduate students with the highest financial need will experience the greatest impact associated with the expedited closure of the resident halls and shift in academic delivery. With that in mind, Emory will provide an immediate “Student Support Stipend” to eligible undergraduate students in the amount of $1,000 within the next week. Students will be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid. Student Employee Salary Replacement Emory students of various income levels and backgrounds hold jobs at Emory and are classified as student employees. These jobs may be administrative, research focused, athletic support or various other activities. The rate of pay is different for each student employee and the hours may vary by job as well as by week-to-week availability, depending upon the student’s academic load and the unit’s need. We are concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the financial well-being of these students who depend on this income in their financial planning. As a means of supporting our student employees as the university moves to remote work and students are leaving campus, we propose to pay estimated earnings for the remaining weeks of the term based on their historical time worked. Students may check with their hiring unit to see if it is possible to continue to work remotely and may be paid for that time as well. Emory Employees Pay and Compensation We are making the commitment that regular faculty and staff employed by Emory University will be paid as usual for the current anticipated duration of the social distancing protocols, no matter their role within Emory and the altered learning/working environment. The process and details are still in development, but we are committed to continuation of pay from Emory during this time of uncertainty. Emory’s administration is committed to our students’ health and well-being, and we are dedicated to supporting their educational journeys with creativity and innovation as they progress along chosen academic pathways. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare Enku Gelaye, Vice President and Dean of Campus Life</p>\n<p>March 16, 2020 7:20 PM Emory Update and Resources Especially for You Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students Dear Parents and Families, Here at Emory, students have always been our most important priority. And so it is natural that we share your deepest concerns for their success and wellbeing. Amid these uncertain times, that’s one reason we are committed to open communication that provides accurate, up-to-date information. A few days ago, we notified the Emory community that two undergraduate students staying at Dobbs Hall and the Clairmont campus were being tested for possible COVID-19. While awaiting test results, the students self-isolated in off-campus housing provided by the university. Today, we can report that both students have tested negative; they will remain in off-campus housing until other arrangements can be made. A third Emory student who lives off campus was tested for possible COVID-19, and has also tested negative. On March 16, two undergraduate students residing at Emory Point tested positive for COVID-19. Both students are in satisfactory condition and are self-isolating in their off-campus apartment. The students, who had left campus for spring break, have not been on the Emory University campus for more than a week; they did not report feeling ill until they returned from the break. Please be assured that Emory’s student health services and other environmental safety personnel interview all individuals within the campus community who test positive for COVID-19. Those interviews not only determine a patient’s contacts and activities, they help guide the university in taking action to safeguard the community’s health. Emory will update the public on COVID-19-specific updates and information via the Emory COVID-19 website, “Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community.” When the spread of COVID-19 was first reported in the U.S., Emory increased the frequency and intensity of its cleaning regime in all areas of the university, focusing on commons areas such as bathrooms, dining facilities and meeting rooms. If students or other members of the university community are tested for COVID-19 –– as with our two undergraduate students who were tested on March 14 — their rooms and workspaces will be cleaned and disinfected as detailed above. We have been advising students to leave campus and, if possible, return to their homes. We understand that it is not possible for all, so Emory is prepared to provide support to those who are unable to relocate and have been granted an exemption. All other students must move out of the residence halls by March 22 at 5 p.m. If you are concerned about traveling to campus to help your student move out, please know that the university can pack and ship belongings or store them locally for your student. We can also make arrangements for you and your student to move out during non-peak hours. For those students who cannot leave campus, Student Health Services will remain open. At this time, our care model will be a hybrid of virtual assessment and in-person visits. In order to manage the volume and protect the health of our patients and caregivers, Student Health Services will identify via phone the best course to seek treatment for those who feel unwell. Students with urgent concerns should call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 or Oxford Student Health Services at 770-784-8376. In the event of severe symptoms, including shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or chest pain, they should call 911 directly. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are working to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to partner closely with local and state agencies to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19.

We thank you for your patience as we continue to navigate this evolving situation. There are a lot of factors at play and we are working to resolve concerns as they arise. In this email we will begin to answer several questions that have been raised in regard to your academics directly with us or through your representatives on College Council.</p>\n<p>Fall 2020 Pre-Registration Pre-Registration will be delayed one week for all undergraduate schools. The new schedule is attached, and we have adjusted your registration appointments accordingly. Appointment times will remain the same, only the date has been amended. These times, which are all in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), should be viewable in OPUS now.</p>\n<p>If you have an advising appointment with a faculty member this week, please confirm with them if this will go ahead or if they would like to postpone your appointment. Faculty are working hard on revising course syllabi so please be flexible. Class Management &#x26; Faculty Expectations Individual instructors will provide you with exact details on course arrangements no later than 5 p.m. EDT on Thursday, March 19. We want to be clear with you regarding teaching expectations from the administration: Synchronous classes will meet at their regularly scheduled time, just in a remote format.</p>\n<p>Some course content may be delivered in an asynchronous format, or a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions. Each delivery method offers different learning opportunities for students that the other method could not provide. Students should expect that faculty will offer this combination.</p>\n<p>Faculty are expected to continue offering regular instruction, assessment and feedback throughout the duration of the semester.</p>\n<p>Faculty are expected to offer office hours through a virtual platform. You should confirm the times/availability of these directly with your faculty.</p>\n<p>Experiential Courses (labs, research, performance courses, internships, etc.) are under review. While you will be unable to continue these courses on campus, your instructors/coordinators are working hard to translate these into a suitable remote format. Some instructors have already provided information about alternative activities; others are working to develop options. More information will be provided as it becomes available. If any of the arrangements communicated by your instructors pose significant difficulties to you (e.g. time differences, lack of reliable internet), please reach out to them and explain your concerns. Faculty are prepared to work with you as best as they can. Technology Access If you do not have access to a computer or are concerned about regular internet access in your home location, please also reach out to OUE directly at oue.advising@emory.edu.

Here is our pledge: As Emory enters this next chapter, we will strive to stay connected, maintaining our essential bond. Even though our community may not be together physically for an unforeseen time, we are committed to moving forward together, united in spirit and service and preserving the care and compassion that have long been a hallmark of this university. That is foundational to who we are as a community, and it will not change. Over the past 24 hours, we’ve understandably received many questions — concerns about housing, remote learning and working, and especially how to best help the Emory community, particularly our students. Many answers to those questions will be updated daily at Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, a website dedicated to our response to COVID-19. It is heartening to be joined by the broader Emory community in our commitment to serving our students. In fact, it’s been moving to see just how quickly support can coalesce. Even as students began packing to leave campus, the Emory Student Government Association was distributing free MARTA passes to help with transportation. We’ve seen staff members working long hours to assist students with specific needs, faculty rapidly developing online lesson plans, and caring alumni who’ve stepped forward to volunteer their help. That outpouring of support has been heartwarming and, of course, not unexpected. For those who are able and eager to help, please consider contributing to the student hardship fund . In addition, the faculty and staff hardship fund offers assistance to other members of our campus community who might be impacted by COVID-19. Moving forward, perhaps one of the most important things we can all do is stay strong and healthy for each other — for our communities, our families and our friends. Let’s work to preserve those connections, our fundamental human bonds. Amid these remarkable times, let us prove what a community can be. Together, we will be stronger for it.</p>\n<p>In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L. Augostini, Executive Vice President Business and Administration, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan S. Lewin, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, Executive Director, Woodruff Health Sciences Center, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Emory Healthcare</p>\n<p>March 14, 2020 9:30 PM Two Emory Undergraduates Tested for Possible COVID-19 Emory College, Oxford College, Business, Graduate, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Theology Students, Faculty, Staff, Healthcare Staff Dear Emory Community, In any public health crisis, it is imperative that information be shared immediately with community members while protecting patient privacy. With that in mind, we wanted to notify our community that two Emory University students in undergraduate housing are being tested for possible COVID-19. Neither case has been confirmed but, out of an abundance of caution, both students are self-isolating in off-campus housing provided by the university. The Emory community will be notified if one or both students test positive. The undergraduates live in Dobbs Hall and at the Clairmont Campus, respectively. Their roommates have been notified and are being supported by student health services staff. The students’ rooms have been cleaned and disinfected by Emory Environmental Health and Safety personnel. Emory’s commitment to the health and safety of our community is paramount. A team of representatives from emergency preparedness, health care, campus life and other units are taking action around-the-clock to protect students, faculty, staff and visitors. We also continue to work closely with local and state partners to monitor and manage any public health issue that has the potential to affect our community, including COVID-19. We understand that the uncertainty and quickly changing dynamic around COVID-19 can bring stress and anxiety. Emory is committed to keeping our community informed and to provide as many resources as possible. Many of these resources and key updates can be found at Emory’s COVID-19 website. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases in Georgia and across the country, students should self-assess for fever or cough. Students who develop symptoms need to separate themselves from others and call Student Health Services at 404-727-7551 (Clifton Rd. campus), or Oxford College Student Services at 770-784-8376. Sincerely, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

We are all disappointed about the need to transition to remote learning and, for many employees, remote working. But we are all dedicated to making the changes necessary to keep each other safe as we continue with the vital mission of the university “to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity,” which is needed now more than ever. Already, you are showing the strength and service that defines the Emory community. Students are reaching out to support each other. Faculty are coming together to adapt their courses for remote learning and plan how they will continue their research. At every level of the university, staff members are going the extra mile to make sure that everyone receives the information and resources they need for our community to continue to thrive even in the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Some of you may be frustrated or anxious in the face of these unprecedented circumstances for you, your family, the university and our broader community. Please know that we are working to answer your questions as quickly and thoroughly as possible in a rapidly evolving situation. Please visit our dedicated website, Coronavirus Updates for the Emory Community, daily for newly updated information and answers to common questions on topics ranging from health and support resources to classes, housing, travel, events, finances and other logistics as we all make this transition together. Please note especially the information on travel and events. In the coming days, we know that the Emory community will remain strong and connected by our common purpose, even if we are no longer together in person on our campuses. Beyond your courses or work assignments, continue to reach out to each other by phone or video to sustain our networks of care and compassion. And as you support each other, know that we are here to support you as well. In community, Jan Love, Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Christopher L.

Emory has now indefinitely suspended all official and previously authorized international travel and is strongly urging our campus community to postpone all university-sponsored domestic travel. Please view Emory’s latest travel restrictions here. We are continuing to monitor the situation and observe all guidance from Emory related to the Coronavirus. We will reopen the program when University directives advise that it is safe to do so. We do not know when that will be. Please continue to collect the necessary materials to apply for PDS funds once the program reopens. We intend to provide enhanced access to PDS funds at that time. During the PDS program suspension period, we will adjust the window for submitting follow-up documentation and reports. For trips/projects that have occurred during February and March 2020, you will now have up to 60 days from the end date to submit these items. Like many other disruptions related to the Coronavirus, this guidance may interfere with your professional plans in the coming months. We are very grateful for your patience and understanding. If you have any specific questions, please direct them to lgs.profdev@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 13, 2020 10:15 AM Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Graduate Students, Faculty, Staff Extended Spring Break As a reminder, Emory University will extend spring break for students until Sunday, March 22, 2020. During this time, no in-person or remote classes should take place. The University will transition to remote learning beginning Monday, March 23. Qualifying Exams/Thesis and Dissertation Defenses Qualifying examinations and thesis and dissertation defenses may take place on campus as scheduled. However, meetings should limit in-person participation to committee members only and options for remote participation must be offered. If desired, public participation may be arranged via remote connection. We strongly advise meeting participants who are considered at higher risk to participate remotely. Please consider social distancing and respiratory hygiene best practices for all meetings. For the remainder of the term, approval forms should be submitted electronically and include scanned signatures. Emory Zoom is recommended and useful for the practices above. Emory’s Teaching and Learning Technologies provides workshops, practice sessions, and instruction videos. Please submit any questions about defenses and exams to Ulf Nilsson at unilsso@emory.edu.</p>\n<p>March 12, 2020 1:00 PM Oxford Housing Move Out/Stay Request Form Oxford College Students Hello Oxford College Students, This communication is an outline to help you with planning next steps as a result of Emory University’s response to COVID-19. Emory University is taking steps to limit the spread of the virus. Students are expected to move out of Emory residential facilities by Sunday, March 22, at 5 PM. This was a difficult decision for the University, but the overall health and well-being of our students, faculty, staff and surrounding community is our priority. We understand that this news impacts each of you in different ways, and we will be here to support you over the coming days. As you prepare for the upcoming transition and begin packing your belongings, we will ensure you have supplies. We will provide moving bins, trash bags and other moving supplies, as well as information about storage options. You will receive more details in the coming days about these resources and move-out procedures. We will consider limited exceptions to allow certain students to remain on campus and provide support for those students who may need assistance with packing. We will review these requests as soon as possible on a case-by-case basis. Exceptions may include: Students who will have difficulty returning to their home country based on governmental travel restrictions due to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Students with demonstrated financial hardship or who are housing insecure.</p>\n<p>Students who are unable to return to Atlanta to pack their belongings All students must complete the Move Out/Stay Request Form by Monday, March 16 at 5:00 p.m. Students who are permitted to stay on campus will be required to relocate to a different residential space. Services will be limited, including access to many facilities, recreation and dining. We know how disappointing it is for you to receive this notification and the disruption it will cause to our community. With the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasizing the importance of taking active measures to contain spread of the virus in communities and mitigate risk to vulnerable populations in their communities, we believe it is the best decision at this time.

As we experience a global pandemic that is expected to worsen in coming days in our area of the country, the University is joining with entities at the local, regional and state level to share resources that may be needed for the health and well-being of our fellow citizens.</p>\n<p>You and your student already are making personal sacrifices that none of us fully envisioned even a month ago. I’m writing today to thank you for all you are doing and to share more information about plans that will have an impact on a small contingent of students and their families. Although this does not affect all of you, I believe it’s important for all of our students and families to understand what – and why – certain decisions have been made in recent days.</p>\n<p>As a state institution with a public trust and mission, we have a duty to share our resources in times of crisis. Our facilities are owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia. It’s our good fortune that the UVA Hospital, a nationally renowned, level one trauma center, is part of our extended Grounds. We offer major resources that can help those suffering from COVID-19 and other illnesses, as well as assist the many doctors, nurses and staff members who are caring for them. Our resources are part of the bigger picture that emergency planners are reviewing to determine a comprehensive, joint response to aid the Central Virginia area.</p>\n<p>At the same time these plans are evolving, we must adhere to medical guidance and concerns for the safety and health of you, your families, our staff members and people in Charlottesville. Many of you have understandably wanted to return to the Grounds to pick up your students’ belongings if they lived in a residence hall. That simply is not possible given all the current concerns about the spread of COVID-19. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, but only when consistent with public health and safety.</p>\n<p>The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds. We are in contact with the some 250 undergraduate students who remain so they are aware of how to access services if they need help.</p>\n<p>Emergency Use of Bond, Bice, Shea, French and Spanish Houses. As part of the overall efforts addressing the COVID-19 crisis, the University recently was asked to provide housing in residence halls near the hospital. The buildings include Bice, Bond, Shea, and the French and Spanish houses. This weekend, eight students who had remained in those five buildings were relocated to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley, located on the opposite side of Grounds.</p>\n<p>As part of this process to answer the call of projected emergency needs, we now must carefully pack up and store all the possessions of students who had lived in those five buildings. The residents of those buildings received an email with details on Sunday and are being asked to complete a questionnaire to help direct the vendor we have retained for packing, moving and storage. A second email further clarifying the process was distributed yesterday. Students who received the questionnaire need to complete it by tomorrow, April 8, so the vendor can handle students’ possessions as carefully as possible and in accordance with their preferences.</p>\n<p>The University is covering the full cost of packing and storing items from these five buildings. Students only need to pay if they want to go to the storage warehouse and pick up their belongings before some point in the future when conditions are safer and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has lifted the stay-home order issued last week. Once a timeframe is set, the vendor will deliver everyone’s packed belongings to a central area of the Grounds where students and parents can pick them up. A range of dates and times for pick-up will be available.</p>\n<p>Governor Northam’s Executive Order. If you live in Virginia, then you know Gov. Northam issued an Executive Order last week directing Virginians to stay at home until June 10. This order, and previous guidance from the governor and other officials, has guided our decisions since mid-March about students returning to Grounds.</p>\n<p>The majority of our students are no longer in Charlottesville. A significant number, however, remain in off-Grounds apartments or houses. By and large, they are following social distancing guidelines and not gathering in groups larger than 10. I have seen exceptions, however, most notably on the UVA Lawn. Enjoying the beautiful spring weather is certainly not a problem, but if you think your student needs a reminder about not gathering in groups larger than 10, please help us out. It’s for their own safety and that of others. The asymptomatic spread of the novel coronavirus poses major concerns.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal Deadline Extended. For students only in the College of Arts &#x26; Sciences, the date to withdraw from the spring term has been changed to May 8 (it had previously been April 14). All College students now have until May 8 to withdraw from the spring 2020 term and return in fall 2020 (or summer). Students in the College have received a notification about this.</p>\n<p>Message from Dean Groves. All students received a message yesterday from University Dean of Students Allen Groves. He reminded students of the importance of social distancing and covered several other important topics, including the possibility of unemployment benefits for students who had part-time jobs and are now having difficulty paying rent or other major expenses. He also listed the many services available remotely, including the services of Student Health and Counseling &#x26; Psychological Services. I encourage you to read his message and ensure your student reads it.</p>\n<p>The University is committed to sharing updates with you as information is available, but we remain in a fluid situation marked by numerous uncertainties. Thank you for all you are doing to support your student as they finish this semester remotely. I hope you and your families are weathering this crisis as well as possible.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>April 6: Ryan Announces Emergency Fund to Assist Contract Workers, UVA Employees</p>\n<p>The following email was distributed to members of the University community on Monday:</p>\n<p>To the University community:</p>\n<p>I am writing to let you know about efforts we are making to support workers furloughed by our contractors and about a contribution to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation.</p>\n<p>A core aspiration of our strategic plan is to be a university that is both great and good. Toward that end, we have committed to doing our best to be a good neighbor and to live our values. That means, among other things, doing what we can to support our most vulnerable community members.</p>\n<p>We have kept our employees on our payroll, and we will continue to do so for as long as we can. Some of our contractors, including Aramark, have furloughed their employees. More may do so in the future. These workers are entitled to state and federal unemployment benefits, as well as some benefits being offered directly by their employers.</p>\n<p>It has become clear that these benefits are not flowing as quickly as any of us would like, and that our contract workers need immediate assistance. It is also clear that there may be a gap between the relief available from unemployment benefits and meeting the necessities of life. Our own employees may also be facing unexpected costs due to the crisis we are all facing.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we are devoting $2 million to create an emergency assistance fund for UVA contract workers and employees. We cannot provide a salary or wages to those who have been furloughed, because doing so would make them ineligible for the state and federal benefits that exist for those who are unemployed. But we can provide funding to help meet an array of needs related to the crisis. Our primary focus will be to help those who have been furloughed, but this fund will also be available for those still employed and facing unexpected costs.</p>\n<p>We will also be providing assistance to furloughed contract workers who need help in applying for state and federal unemployment benefits, and we expect this fund to be a helpful bridge to those who are awaiting benefits. We will keep this fund operational until June 1, and we will reassess at that point.</p>\n<p>We will have more details to share by mid-week, including a timeline and process for accessing the funds. A number of you have contacted me about helping out your colleagues, and I’m grateful for your interest and compassion. To facilitate that help, we are setting up a process for employees to donate directly to this fund.</p>\n<p>We are also committed to being a good neighbor to the Charlottesville region. For that reason, we are also contributing $1 million to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation to support their efforts to stabilize households during this pandemic. The Foundation has already raised over $2.3 million to support these efforts, and they are doing great work and deserve our support. For anyone who needs immediate assistance, please call their Community Resource Helpline at 434-234-4490.</p>\n<p>We will have more to say later this week about additional steps we are going to take to support our community, but I did not want to wait to get this information out. We face challenges ahead. We will only get through them by working together and doing what we can to support each other. Thanks for all of your efforts in that regard.</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>April 5: Update from the Dean of Students</p>\n<p>Dear Undergraduate, Graduate and Professional School Students:</p>\n<p>I’m writing today to offer updates on a few subjects, and also to check in on you. As April begins, it’s still somewhat difficult to fully grasp all that has occurred over the past few weeks. I imagine you are feeling a range of emotions. I hope as you deal with this upheaval in your life you will take some time for self-care and reflection. If you are spending major portions of your day in front of a computer instead of in a classroom or research lab or library with the friends, advisors, colleagues, and the routines you had come to enjoy, social isolation can be a real problem. Feelings of distance, loneliness, and even depression can result. Many of us feel a bit of “cabin fever” and that’s quite natural. Things as simple as taking a long walk and enjoying nature can help in dealing with the uncertainty everyone is feeling now.</p>\n<p>I urge you to stay connected with your friends and whoever else lifts your spirits. Prioritize your health, including getting adequate sleep, moving your muscles, and eating nutritiously. If you would like to speak with a counselor at any point, we continue to offer services through CAPS and Student Health remotely. Please see the end of this message for resources and contact information.</p>\n<p>If you are having difficulty with your courses, either because of the material, online delivery, or other issue, please reach out for help. If you are an undergraduate student, please call on your professor, teaching assistant, academic advisor, association dean (if in the College), or perhaps engage with a tutor or peer. Graduate and professional students should reach out to their professor, advisor, research director, department chair, or academic dean.</p>\n<p>• Governor Northam’s Executive Order. The warm spring weather can be a soothing antidote to stress, but it carries a risk as well. It remains very important to practice social distancing and abide by local directives. While it will be tempting to gather outside in groups, it is essential that you follow orders like those issued by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to maintain social distancing and only go out for essential needs. The Governor’s most recent Executive Order directs Virginians to stay at home through June 10. This does not preclude going out for a walk, for example, but if you go with a few friends, you should be mindful of keeping a distance of at least six feet between you. No groups of 10 or more can gather outside or elsewhere in Virginia, on public or private property. Many other states have similar restrictions aimed at “flattening the curve” and avoiding larger scale COVID-19 infections that may overwhelm our health care system.</p>\n<p>• Doing Our Part. We know the COVID-19 crisis is worsening in most of the country, including in Virginia. University leaders are responding by turning significant attention to our health system and standing ready to support the consolidated, joint efforts of emergency teams in the Charlottesville community and larger central Virginia area. As a state institution with a public trust and mission, it is our duty to respond to requests for use of our facilities and resources at the local, regional, state, and national levels.</p>\n<p>• Emergency Use of Residence Halls. Within the past few days, we have responded to requests from emergency planners to make residence hall space available near the UVA Hospital. The 15 undergraduate students who still resided in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses have been relocated this weekend, with help from the teams in Housing &#x26; Residence Life and Facilities Management, to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley. Additionally, students who had been living in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses – but had left Charlottesville previously – have been notified that the University will be carefully packing and storing their belongings at no cost to students, so the buildings can be used to support needs arising from this crisis. (Students can also choose to have their belongings shipped to them at their expense.)</p>\n<p>This crisis bears similarities to war efforts of the past when citizens had to make sacrifices and pull together for the greater good. I regret some decisions have come very quickly with little advance communication, but the situation is exceptionally fluid right now and the University is part of larger efforts with new priorities emerging daily. Whenever possible, we are committed to communicating with you in advance and as fully as possible. We will always endeavor not simply to tell you what action is being taken, but also why.</p>\n<p>• Retrieving Belongings from the Residence Halls. Given medical guidance and concerns for the health of you, your families, and people in Charlottesville, it will not be possible for students who were living in residence halls to come back to the Grounds at this time to retrieve personal possessions from on-Grounds residences. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, and only when consistent with public health and safety. The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds.</p>\n<p>• Support for International Students. Of special note is that many of the undergraduate and graduate students remaining on Grounds and in our Charlottesville community are international students. We recognize the special challenges they face being far from home. We communicated last week with all students remaining on Grounds and emphasized how they can access needed services. For our international students in particular, we want to underscore our condemnation of, and resolve to combat, any acts of bias or xenophobia against them. If you have been the target of such an act, please report it through the University’s Just Report It system. Of course, if you believe you are ever in immediate danger, you should always call 911.</p>\n<p>• Financial Hardships. Without question, the coronavirus crisis is taking an economic toll on many, including our students, faculty and staff, and their families. The University is examining how costs and losses are affecting our operations. This includes the recognition that some families who have been hit especially hard may need to update their financial information with Student Financial Services for purposes of calculating institutional aid and access to other resources.</p>\n<p>Many students have expressed considerable concern about losing their wages from part-time jobs, affecting their ability to pay rent and other major expenses. Please note, the Student Legal Services office, which is staffed by attorney Lester Wilson and funded by the Student Activity Fee, may be a resource to assist you. More information is available on the Student Legal Services website.</p>\n<p>New federal legislation may also grant part-time student workers eligibility for unemployment benefits through the Virginia Employment Commission. Students who had part-time jobs, but are currently unemployed, can apply now on the VEC website. Applicants will need to renew their claims weekly, preferably Mondays through Wednesdays. The VEC website states VEC is still awaiting guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, so the timing of funding is uncertain. If you are a part-time student worker who lost your job in another state, you should apply using that state’s website to seek unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p>We are grateful to our graduate students for the support they continue to provide to the University’s core missions of teaching and research. For those students who are serving as Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs), the University’s policy on continuity of pay is noted on the Human Resources website. During the spring term, GTAs continue in their roles of working with faculty in teaching remotely for the remainder of the semester, while GRAs and research fellows continue to work with their faculty advisors and supervisors to engage in the activities of their research groups, including continuing research remotely to the extent possible. We know how disruptive this pandemic has been to the academic careers of our graduate students. The Provost and the Vice President for Research continue to work with the deans and faculty to find ways to ensure the success of our graduate students during this time of disruption in their education and research.</p>\n<p>Emergency funding continues to be available for all students in need. As a reminder, three forms of funding are available:</p>\n<p>• Final Exercises. Having walked the Lawn myself as a graduating student, I fully recognize the importance of walking the Lawn for our graduating students and their families. Last month, President Ryan asked Pam Higgins, Executive Director for Major Events in the President’s Office, and me to lead a working group of undergraduate and graduate students and representatives from the schools to recommend ways for a meaningful celebration still to occur on the Lawn. We hope to present recommendations soon to President Ryan and his senior leadership team. You should expect to hear directly from President Ryan on this topic in the coming weeks, as he is committed to seeing this through for you.</p>\n<p>• Providing Support. Many of you have expressed interest in supporting the University Health System and our local community, and we have seen many gestures of generosity. If you would like to learn more about how you can support the care needs of the Health System, please visit their website.</p>\n<p>With six weeks remaining in the semester, I hope to communicate several more times before everyone finishes the term. I personally want to stay connected with you, and I feel it is important for you to receive regular updates about important student topics and how the University is responding to the coronavirus crisis.</p>\n<p>I wish the best to each of you and your families.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Allen W.

But I realize many of you may be wondering about Governor Northam’s Executive Order, which was released this afternoon. So before I get to the summer programs, let me say a few words about the Governor’s Executive Order.</p>\n<p>The order requires all Virginia residents to remain at home, unless they are traveling to and from work or seeking essential services like medical care, food, or banking. Institutions of higher education, like UVA, “shall cease all in-person classes and instruction, and cancel all gatherings of more than ten individuals. For purposes of facilitating remote learning, performing critical research, or performing essential functions, institutions of higher education may continue to operate, provided that social distancing requirements are maintained.”</p>\n<p>This order is consistent with the decisions we have made over the last few weeks and will not change the way we are currently operating. If more changes become necessary, we will let you know.</p>\n<p>As far as this summer is concerned, in keeping with our decisions about this semester, we have decided to cancel all in-person summer programs through June 30th, 2020. “Summer programs” include classes, conferences, camps, and other events that are scheduled to occur on Grounds through June 30th.</p>\n<p>This means that classes offered during Summer Session 1 and 2 will move online. You can find more information about Summer Session at <a href=\"https://summer.virginia.edu/\">https://summer.virginia.edu/</a>. By June 1st, we will make a decision about in-person summer programs occurring after July 1st.</p>\n<p>As always, please visit <a href=\"https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus</a> for the most up-to-date information on our response to COVID-19 and answers to frequently asked questions. I hope that you and yours are safe and healthy.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>March 23: Provost Clarifies the State of Research and Warns of Potential Shutdown</p>\n<p>Dear UVA Faculty and those involved in the research enterprise:</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience as we work together to tackle this fast-moving and complex public health crisis. We understand this has been a difficult period, including for those engaged in the important task of research, whether they do their work in a lab or in an office or in the field. As you know, last week, the University announced extraordinary measures to “flatten the curve” even as we work to continue our missions of teaching, research, and clinical care. The following day, the University announced that these measures apply to the research enterprise.</p>\n<p>This message follows up on this March 20 communication from our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian. I write to: i) provide two reminders; ii) to clarify the University’s approach to the engagement of graduate students in research during this period; and iii) to emphasize that all engaged in the research enterprise should be preparing for the possibility of a shutdown of ongoing research and resorting only to the maintenance of key laboratory assets.</p>\n<p>First, two reminders:</p>\n<p>I want to reaffirm the University position on research: As announced last week, the research enterprise should be shifting to key functions only – and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked here . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school.</p>\n<p>– and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school. In keeping with the University-wide approach to “flattening the curve”: All employees, including those engaged in the research enterprise, who can work from home, must work from home and their supervisor (here, PI) must require that they do so. Like all managers, a PI can “designate” a category of employees who must report in person to perform key functions. In keeping with efforts to “flatten the curve,” this category must be as small as possible to perform those tasks and the PI must assure that the safest practices are followed.</p>\n<p>Second, regarding the role of graduate students in the days ahead:</p>\n<p>As a matter of principle, the University position is that graduate students are – first and foremost – students . We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future.</p>\n<p>. We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future. Given their status as students, the rule is this: a faculty member is not permitted to “designate” a graduate student, which would mean that the graduate student must report in person to perform key tasks. This rule is subject to narrow exceptions (decided through a process described below) if the PI/Research Leader and graduate student jointly request an exception.</p>\n<p>Exceptions : I will, after consulting with others (the relevant school dean, the VPR, and the EVPHA) determine whether an exception to this rule will be granted. Petitions to permit a graduate student to continue in-person work should be submitted by the PI and as the form indicates with the consent of the graduate student to the Provost’s Office by using this form.</p>\n<p>Third, it is critical that all PIs/Research Leaders plan for a shutdown of ongoing research. We do not know if or when that might occur; as has happened in some other states, it is possible that the decision will be required by a government order over which we have little control. Given this, it is crucial that researchers have a plan to preserve the vital material that is essential for research (for example, animals, cells, continuously run instruments and machines, special materials, and reagents). This task of preservation and planning will assure that, if we must pause our ongoing research, we will be positioned to return to this important endeavor whenever the pause is over. Believe me, all of us wish we could predict if and when we might have to shut down ongoing research; but we do not yet know. I assure you that we will continue to keep the UVA research community up to date in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and generosity of spirit during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 19: New Cases of COVID-19 Includes UVA Student</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University community on March 19:</p>\n<p>Dear University community:</p>\n<p>Earlier today the Virginia Department of Health confirmed three new cases of COVID-19 in the Charlottesville area.</p>\n<p>One of those cases is a UVA student who lives off Grounds in Albemarle County. The student, who is believed to have contracted the virus during recent international travel, is in isolation and receiving care following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish this student a speedy recovery during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort, with the assistance of University officials, to identify people who were in contact with this individual, reaching out to those individuals and arranging for their self-isolation, if necessary.</p>\n<p>The health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority. We realize a case of COVID-19 within our student body creates a heightened sense of anxiety and concern. The University coronavirus page offers a number of resources to help community members stay healthy and to cope with the strain this period is placing on all of us.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, as we work together to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>Additional information is available from the CDC.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, please respond to this email at covidinformation@virginia.edu or call 877-685-4836 (domestic) or 1-202-800-2408 (international).</p>\n<p>We have posted notification of this recent case on the UVA Coronavirus website. As a result of the expected spread of the coronavirus and the development of additional testing capacity, there will likely be additional cases in the coming days. We will not be emailing about each of them, but our default will be to post notifications of new cases to the coronavirus website and to email about new cases sparingly.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for your continued support and compassion during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Christopher P. Holstege, M.D.</p>\n<p>Department of Student Health &#x26; Wellness</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>March 18: Provost Outlines Undergraduate Grading Policy for Online Courses</p>\n<p>Dear UVA faculty, students, and staff:</p>\n<p>We are facing extraordinary challenges as a result of COVID-19. As the letter President Ryan and I shared yesterday made clear, this has required rapid and consequential decision making. In seeking to fulfill our academic mission, our guiding principles are clear: We will work to protect our University community and our neighbors, and we will do all we can to continue educating our students and pursuing our research. The effort to sustain our educational mission has required enormous effort and creativity by thousands of faculty and staff. As we launch tomorrow into our rapid transition from in-person to online instruction for the remainder of this semester, I am writing to provide direction on how we will handle grading for undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>For this semester, for our undergraduate schools, credit/no credit (CR/NC) will be the default grading system for all classes where the work is not yet completed; students will also, however, have the option to receive a letter grade. Students must decide whether to receive a letter grade by the last day of spring semester classes, Tuesday, April 28th. We will be in touch about the process for making that choice as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Several other details are important:</p>\n<p>Courses taken for CR/NC during Spring 2020 will count toward curricular, major, and graduation requirements. Such grades are not factored into a student’s GPA. Students who remain in the CR/NC option must complete the class with a grade of C or better to receive credit.</p>\n<p>This policy applies only to undergraduate level courses. The deans of the graduate and professional programs are considering how they will approach this question, and they will soon announce their decisions to their schools.</p>\n<p>UVA will include a designation on students’ transcripts to indicate that the CR/NC option was created in the midst of an extraordinary crisis and as part of the University’s effort to manage the transition to online instruction.</p>\n<p>These are not ordinary times. Every day, I am struck anew by the enormity of the challenges and the enormity of the effort being brought to bear to meet those challenges. As we resume the semester with online courses tomorrow, I want to thank all of you for your ingenuity, understanding, and patience. I remain confident in our collective ability to navigate this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 18: Provost Outlines Guidance for Maintaining Research Continuity</p>\n<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>\n<p>I write to provide an update on our approach to research, as promised in yesterday's University message. In consultation with President Ryan, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Craig Kent, and Vice President for Research Ram Ramasubramanian, the following principles are guiding our efforts on research. Research, like education, is central to the University's mission. Similar to our extraordinary effort to move classes online, we are taking dramatic steps to respond to this public health crisis while continuing our research mission.</p>\n<p>In keeping with, and directly quoting, yesterday’s message: “All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools, or UVA Health.” This directive applies to all University employees. Like managers across Grounds, Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers “have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.”</p>\n<p>We all remain grateful for your patience and partnership as we face these unprecedented times. In addition to the University’s coronavirus website, please visit the Vice President for Research website for specific resources and detailed guidance. Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers can find detailed research continuity guidelines here.</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 17: COVID-19 Causes Sweeping Changes to University Operations</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University Community on March 17:</p>\n<p>To the University community,</p>\n<p>We write with some important updates across a range of issues. As you know, this is an unprecedented and very rapidly changing situation, and all of us are learning more every day. At this point, it seems imperative that we do our very best to slow the progression of this virus in order to “flatten the curve” of those infected and avoid overwhelming our health system, which would ultimately risk our patients, our community, and our Charlottesville neighbors. This requires taking some significant, additional steps at this point.</p>\n<p>We realize and regret that these additional steps will cause more disappointment and call for more sacrifice, but we see no other way to do our part to help confront this public health crisis. We must also be mindful of the need of our students, their families, and our faculty and staff to plan, and we need to be mindful of protecting our faculty and staff, who make this place run. For all of those reasons, today we are announcing the following changes, including adjustments to classes, research, and events; guidance for employees; and modifications to services.</p>\n<p>These changes will go into effect immediately wherever possible, though we recognize that some may take a bit of time to implement fully, as explained more below.</p>\n<p>ADJUSTMENTS TO CLASSES, RESEARCH, AND EVENTS</p>\n<p>Classes will remain online throughout the semester. It is exceedingly unlikely, based on all that we know at this point, that this virus will have abated by the end of April. In light of the need for faculty, staff, and students to make plans, we are making the decision now – rather than waiting until April 5 – to not hold any classes on Grounds this semester. For students who do not have the technology needed to complete their classes online, please visit our technology support fund page and read the instructions and guidelines completely. We are in active discussions about what changes we might make to our normal grading system this semester. We will be back in touch soon, once we have made a decision.</p>\n<p>Final Exercises will not proceed as planned. In light of the evidence about the likely progression of the virus over the next couple of months, and when it will peak, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Final Exercises as currently planned. We did not make this decision lightly, as we know how disappointing it will be to graduating students and their families. That said, a team is already focused on developing creative alternatives to mark this important occasion, and we will communicate updates as we have them.</p>\n<p>All events on Grounds are cancelled, no matter the size, until at least May 15. We had originally cancelled events over 100, but on Sunday the CDC suggested no groups larger than 50, and just recently the White House and the Governor of Virginia suggested gatherings of no more than 10 people. Rather than continue to chase the ever-shrinking size limitations, we want to be clear that all events should be cancelled this semester. These restrictions include events that are not University-sponsored, but are planned to occur on Grounds, including conferences, symposia, and social gatherings. This does not preclude small internal meetings, where social distancing should be the touchstone.</p>\n<p>Research. Like our teaching mission, we are committed to continuing our research mission while making sure we take steps to keep members of our community safe. We will provide guidance on this by mid-day tomorrow, Wednesday, March 18.</p>\n<p>GUIDANCE FOR EMPLOYEES</p>\n<p>All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools or UVA Health. The latter includes, among others, faculty who need to come to their classrooms or offices to teach online, and UVA Health faculty and staff who need to care for patients and support patient services. The traditional categories of “designated” and “non-designated” are helpful but not entirely relevant here, given that those categories envisioned short delays due to weather problems. School leaders, unit supervisors, and managers have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.</p>\n<p>Employee Compensation and Benefits. We are committed to our employees. We are determined to ensure that the modifications to our operations caused by the coronavirus will not impact our existing commitments to compensate and continue existing benefits for UVA employees, whether part time or full time. We will, therefore, honor all existing commitments for the foreseeable future. The length of this crisis is difficult to predict at this point, as are the economic ramifications. There may come a point where we need to reassess in light of the length of time of the crisis or significantly changes circumstances, but our hope and plan is to weather this crisis together.</p>\n<p>To be clear, those who must report for work will have to do so. Those who can work remotely will have to do so. Those who fall into neither category may be asked to perform other functions for their units or schools or to take on tasks elsewhere at the University. Whether or not these employees are able to be re-deployed, we will honor existing employment commitments for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Contract Employees. We have relationships with a wide range of contractors across the University, which present a variety of situations. We are in active conversations with these contractors and hope to be able to provide an update fairly soon.</p>\n<p>Student Employees. This change in operations will have an impact on our student employees as well. Students who are teaching assistants or working on research will continue to be paid if they continue their work. Student employees who are able to complete their duties remotely can do so with the approval of their supervisor. Students should submit timesheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage. Student in the Federal Work Study program (FWS) will continue to be paid an average of their current wages bi-weekly through the end of the semester. Students on FWS who will continue to work remotely should submit time sheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage.</p>\n<p>For the safety of students and the others with whom they may come into contact, non FWS student employees who cannot work remotely will not be eligible to continue working while the University’s operating schedule is modified due to COVID-19. We understand that this will cause some students financial hardship, and we will do whatever we can to help. If you are in need of financial support, please connect with your supervisor, who has received a list of emergency financial resources available to displaced student employees.</p>\n<p>MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICES; CREDITS OR REFUNDS FOR HOUSING AND DINING</p>\n<p>On-Grounds Housing Will Be Further Restricted. As our resources and on-site staffing levels diminish due to social distancing directives, and due to increasing emphasis on the importance of social distancing, we will only be able to provide on-Grounds Housing for a very limited number of residents. Only students who have no other option will be permitted to remain on-Grounds. As a reminder, students who are returning solely to collect some of their belongings still have until Wednesday, March 18 at noon to do so. If you are not able to collect your belongings before then, please do not return to Grounds until you hear from us with guidance, which will be coming soon. We will provide details about when and how students will be able to gather all of their belongings.</p>\n<p>Any students who stayed in on-Grounds Housing following our initial request to return home must make plans to leave by Friday, March 20 unless they meet one of the following criteria: 1) international students who are unable to secure travel to return home; 2) persons for whom their on-Grounds residence is their only home (including graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff for whom their on-Grounds residence is their permanent address); or 3) students for whom traveling home would present a severe health or safety risk. Housing &#x26; Residence Life will contact students who completed the original survey to remain on Grounds, and work with them to transition back home. As before, students currently receiving financial aid with questions related to financial resources for departing Grounds should contact UVA Student Financial Services at sfs@virginia.edu or 434.982.6000.</p>\n<p>We are urging undergraduate and graduate students who live off-Grounds to follow these guidelines as well .</p>\n<p>Dining</p>\n<p>Dining options will be very limited. Effective immediately, Observatory Hill Dining Hall will serve as the only major dining facility in service, apart from those necessary to support UVA Health. Those using O-Hill can obtain their meals there but will not be able to eat inside the facility. Please visit the University’s Dining website for hours of operation and real-time updates. Wherever possible, we encourage students who have kitchens in their place of residence to prepare their own meals.</p>\n<p>Credits or Refunds for Housing and Dining</p>\n<p>We will provide pro-rated credits to student accounts for on-Grounds Housing and UVA dining contracts. We will send additional information on the mechanics of this process in a later communication, but students will have the ability to either request a refund or allow the credit to remain on their student account to apply to future bills. As long as students remain enrolled through the end of the spring semester, financial aid will not be impacted.</p>\n<p>We are making a number of modifications to various services. Dining services, as described above, will be limited to take out/grab and go only. All libraries will be closed, except to faculty and staff who need to use them for teaching online classes or clinical care. Student activity spaces, like those in Newcomb Hall, 1515, and the Student Activities Building, will be closed. All gyms and fitness facilities on Grounds will be closed. University venues such as the museums, the McCormick Observatory, and the Rotunda will be closed to the public. Bus service will be reduced. More details will be forthcoming with respect to all of these topics and will be posted on the University’s coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>This message covers sweeping changes that would usually be made only after months of consideration and discussion. In the face of this rapidly evolving public health crisis, however, we have been called to make the best decisions we can in a limited amount of time in order to look out for the health and safety of our community, both at the University and in the surrounding Charlottesville region. Implementing these changes will no doubt be difficult, and we know further questions will arise, but we remain as confident as ever in our community’s ability to navigate this unprecedented set of challenges together. In the meantime, our profound thanks to everyone in this community for your dedication, creativity, and compassion.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>March 17: UVA Outlines Child Care Options for Employees</p>\n<p>Dear UVA Health Community:</p>\n<p>To address the extensive caregiving needs created by the K-12 school closure, the University has expanded our caregiving support network. These services are either subsidized or fully reimbursed.

At this point, some of you are probably trying to figure out how to support your family and your career while schools are closed, which is one of the reasons I’d like to share a brief reminder of our telecommuting policy.</p>\n<p>To begin, while most students are gone and online instruction will begin on Thursday, UVA remains open and operating – meaning faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. That said, our telecommuting policy is designed to give employees the flexibility to work remotely when necessary and possible.</p>\n<p>If you need to work remotely, please talk to your manager. I realize it may be difficult to take care of your families and work remotely at the same time, which is why I encourage flexibility and creativity from both employees and managers. I would also ask that managers please give your employees the option to work remotely – provided you are still able to keep your units open for business. As a reminder, any employee who is ill should go home immediately and seek appropriate medical attention.</p>\n<p>As we announced yesterday, two weeks of additional paid leave (Public Health Emergency Leave) is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member diagnosed with the disease. This leave, however, cannot be used for child care.</p>\n<p>Employees who must stay home to care for children while schools are closed and can’t work remotely should use University Time Off (University Staff) or the equivalent for classified staff. We offer benefits to assist with care for benefits-eligible employees who need temporary care and are looking into options for providing additional care options.</p>\n<p>We will notify you if we need to make any changes to our telecommuting policy and will post any new information in the Working Remotely section of the University’s Coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for everything you are doing for UVA – every day, and especially over the last few weeks. We could not do any of this without you, and I am profoundly grateful. Lastly, updates on the coronavirus generally and our response to it will be posted regularly on our coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Kelley Stuck</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer</p>\n<p>March 16: Confirmed Case of COVID-19 in University Community</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University Community on March 16:</p>\n<p>Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:</p>\n<p>As you know from the notification received earlier today, the University has confirmed a case of COVID-19 within our community. The individual who is ill, a staff member at the UVA Women’s Center who lives off Grounds, is receiving care and in quarantine at home following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish her a speedy and full recovery.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort to identify individuals who were in contact with the staff member, reaching out to those individuals, and arranging for their isolation. University staff are also working to support potentially impacted students, faculty and staff. In addition, the UVA Women’s Center is being vacated and deep-cleaned with products that kill the coronavirus in accordance with CDC guidelines.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. If you exhibit these symptoms, please contact your health care provider and follow their instructions before leaving your home and potentially putting others at risk:</p>\n<p>Students: Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.</p>\n<p>Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.

If you do not have a primary care physician you may call the Virginia Department of Heath hotline at 877-ASK-VDH3 (877-275-8343).</p>\n<p>As we work together as a community to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>Additional information is available from the CDC.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all you are doing during this challenging time to safeguard your own health and that of others.

You can also consult the University’s Novel Coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Given the progression of the virus, it is not a surprise to discover a local case, but we know it will heighten anxiety. We will be in further touch to announce any additional changes we are making as the situation unfolds, and we will continue to update the website. Now, more than ever, is the time to treat each other with kindness and compassion.

I realize you have been receiving a great many messages from the University this week, so I am going to highlight my most important points up front. First, if you can return to your home, we need you to do so as soon as possible. Second, if you are away from Grounds and only need a few essential belongings, we can help.</p>\n<p>Now, the details:</p>\n<p>If you live on Grounds: With your permission, we can arrange for a staff person to go to your room, retrieve essential items you need, and ship them to you. You also are welcome to have a friend do this. To make arrangements for either, please contact housing@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>If you live off Grounds: We have enlisted the help of primary landlords in the area. If you need items from your home or apartment, please call your landlord for help with this or other critical matters. We also hope those of you residing in fraternity and sorority houses will return home. We have been in contact with alumni house corporation officers to seek their (and your) cooperation. If you have friends still in town, please consider asking for their help in collecting your belongings before they leave.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, some leases require that you let your landlord know, in writing, if you will be gone for a week or more. Please check your lease and make sure you follow these and other instructions. If you don't have a copy of your lease, ask your landlord to email it to you.</p>\n<p>It is very important that you return home and be ready to start virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We know some of you will need to stay due to unavoidable circumstances, but otherwise, you should be returning home right away. If you need to return to collect your belongings from your apartment or residence hall, please make every effort to make your trip as brief as possible. We are facing a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. You are risking not only your own health if you continue to gather in groups and circulate in the area, but also – of critical importance – you are risking the health of others in our community who are likely to be more affected by this disease.</p>\n<p>International students and those living a great distance from Grounds: If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.</p>\n<p>Student Workers: Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work. This flexibility applies to students who started classes this spring and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place. The employment of other student workers is under discussion by University leadership, but nothing has been determined at this point.</p>\n<p>Financial concerns: The University is committed to assisting students in need during this unprecedented time. If you are currently receiving financial aid and have questions about resources for leaving Grounds and returning home, please contact UVA Student Financial Services through a special website for Emergency Travel Assistance.</p>\n<p>Online resources: We recognize what an abrupt and challenging transition it will be to shift to virtual classes. Faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and you will have support from the University. You will be able to link to resources through the coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all the steps you are taking to help us respond to this health crisis. This is an unprecedented situation in our lifetimes, and I respectfully ask each of you to do the responsible thing as citizens in a larger community. Your willingness to comply with what is being asked of you will help the broader community – including many at-risk individuals – minimize the impact of this crisis as much as possible. Unlike some crises we witness from afar, this is one where we can each take action that has a tangible result. Individual actions will make a huge difference in how we face and eventually spring back from this difficult challenge. In this case, a selfless decision on your part may save a life.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Allen W. Groves</p>\n<p>University Dean of Students</p>\n<p>March 13: Message Urges Parents to Help Ensure Students Return Home</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered on March 13 to UVA parents and guardians of students:</p>\n<p>Dear Parents and Guardians:</p>\n<p>I am writing to you as someone who cares deeply about your students' safety, health, and well-being. We are facing a public health crisis worldwide, nationwide, and here in Virginia.</p>\n<p>On behalf of the University and larger Charlottesville community, I am appealing to you if your student has told you they want to remain here: We need your help ensuring your student returns home and is ready to begin virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We recognize a small number of students cannot leave due to unavoidable circumstances, and we will continue to support those students, but we need all other students to return home for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>We are especially concerned right now about students living off Grounds. Last night, a number of students were celebrating on the Corner, and a rumor is circulating about more gatherings this evening. We need your assistance in helping them understand the dangers posed by COVID-19. While they may not become sick or may suffer only mild symptoms, they could potentially infect residents in the local community who could contract the disease and become acutely ill.</p>\n<p>We made the very difficult decision to move our classes to virtual instruction not only based on the health and welfare of our students, but also because we want to ensure that the UVA Health System, a Level 1 trauma center, is not stretched too thin in the coming weeks and months. We believe the fewer students in Charlottesville right now, the better for our health system and, thus, for the health and welfare of everyone in the region.</p>\n<p>Mitigating this crisis must be a community-wide effort, and we have enlisted the help of the area's primary landlords, asking them to reiterate these concerns to their student-tenants. Yesterday, we engaged alumni who manage Greek housing, asking their help as well. If your student lives off Grounds and needs individual help with matters like retrieving their most important belongings, they should contact their landlord directly. If your student encounters difficulty after contacting their landlord, please have them email the Office of the Dean of Students at odos@virginia.edu for assistance.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if your student lives on Grounds and they need a few essential things from their room, they can have a friend pick up the items or arrange for a staff member to enter their room to get the items and ship them. For help with this – only if your student lives in on-Grounds housing – please email housing@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>Your student will be hearing more from the University soon about the transition to virtual classes. We know this will be an abrupt and challenging transition, but faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and your student will have support from the University. In addition, Allen Groves, University Dean of Students, will be communicating soon with your student to further clarify a variety of questions that have arisen.</p>\n<p>Thank you to each of you for your help and support. I know there are many whose student is already at home or planning to be at home soon. We are grateful for your partnership and quick action.</p>\n<p>In my 40 years at the University, I have faced many crises, yet none like this. Most of our students have no memory of September 11. This, however, is a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. We must help them understand how vital it is to unite around this crisis. The COVID-19 health crisis is forcing each of us to make sacrifices and changes none of us wants to make. In the end, however, it is not about us. It’s about our responsibility to our fellow human beings. Thank you for all you and your student are doing during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Finally, please continue to check our coronavirus website, which is being updated continually with new information. If you have questions, please call our Response Lines at 877-685-4836: domestic; 1-202-800-2408: international; or email covidinformation@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>March 12: More details about COVID-19 changes</p>\n<p>Dear members of the UVA Community:</p>\n<p>I write to provide a few updates following President Ryan’s email from yesterday about the steps the University is taking in response to the COVID-19 threat. If you have not yet done so, I encourage you to read his message closely.</p>\n<p>To review, President Ryan announced a series of actions yesterday—gearing up to deliver classes on-line as of March 19th, strongly encouraging students to return home if they can, and prohibiting certain events on Grounds. These actions are all guided by the the desire (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. We can advance all of those goals by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds.</p>\n<p>Today we are providing additional updates and announcing several additional changes, some of which are relevant to the entire community, and some of which are specific to faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>First, the more general updates:</p>\n<p>We will be making a decision about Final Exercises by April 15th.</p>\n<p>We know this is top of mind for many of you, especially graduating students, and we are working as fast as we can to give you some clarity – understanding that we don’t yet know what the situation will look like in May.</p>\n<p>Events at John Paul Jones Arena are postponed at least through the weekend.</p>\n<p>Please visit www.johnpauljonesarena.com for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster.</p>\n<p>for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster. We will continue to work with performers and others involved in events scheduled to take place at John Paul Jones arena to evaluate additional upcoming events.</p>\n<p>The ACC has suspended the Spring Athletics season.</p>\n<p>Earlier today, the ACC announced that they have suspended all athletic related activities. This means that all Spring sports at UVA are canceled.</p>\n<p>Fans who have already purchased tickets may contact the Virginia Athletics Ticket Office by phone at 800-542-8821 or by email at uvatickets@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>We are looking into offseting dining and housing costs for students.</p>\n<p>We have set up a Financial Resource Working Group that is looking into, among other things, offsetting dining and housing costs for students. More details will follow soon.</p>\n<p>We also have a Student Life and Leadership fund, which is a rainy day fund distributed by the Student Affairs Office for students with unexpected expenses.</p>\n<p>Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work.</p>\n<p>This flexibility applies to students who started classes for the Spring 2020 term and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place.</p>\n<p>If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.</p>\n<p>Early this morning, the University suspended all of its current study-abroad programs, and encouraged all UVA students to return to the United States by this weekend. The International Studies Office contacted participants in these programs individually.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Below are more specific updates for faculty, staff, and graduate students working on Grounds.</p>\n<p>Let me start by acknowledging how difficult this situation is for all members of our University community and express the leadership’s deep gratitude for your hard work and your dedication to UVA’s missions.</p>\n<p>The University is open and operating.</p>\n<p>Given normal operations, faculty and staff should continue to report to work as usual (you can find more detail on our human resources policies below).</p>\n<p>We will begin scaling back some services, like dining and bus service, but will still meet the needs of employees and the limited number of students who will be remaining on Grounds. Any changes in these services will be posted on the Operations Status Board , and details will be available on departmental websites.</p>\n<p>, and details will be available on departmental websites. Libraries will remain open from 8am to 5pm daily, with the possible exception of weekends. Some locations that depend heavily on student workers may close.</p>\n<p>We are monitoring this rapidly evolving situation closely. A cross-university team, including medical professionals, meets daily. If any modification to the University’s operating schedule becomes necessary, we will let you know immediately.</p>\n<p>Human Resources: All faculty and staff should continue reporting to work, but employees will be eligible for a new leave benefit.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. However, when possible, we do encourage managers to consider options for staff and faculty to work from home. You can find answers to questions about working remotely here .</p>\n<p>. If you have an underlying health condition that necessitates working from home, please talk to your manager, department chair, or dean. They, in turn, are encouraged to be flexible if an employee has a compromised health situation or is caring for someone who does.</p>\n<p>As of today, all employees, including wage and temporary employees, are eligible for up to two weeks of leave if they have been impacted by the virus. This includes employees in both the Academic Division and Medical Center.</p>\n<p>This leave is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member who diagnosed with the disease. More details on this new policy can be found here or you can contact the or contact the HR Solution Center at AskHR@virginia.edu or 434-243-3344.</p>\n<p>Teaching continuity: We are working to support faculty as classes move online.</p>\n<p>We have an all-hands-on-deck approach to bringing our teaching on line. Below are updates on some of the key developments from the cross-university team that is working on this.</p>\n<p>We sent out a survey to faculty and instructors yesterday to determine the support needed to move classes online and we have a plan in place to provide support – either centrally or through schools. If you received the survey and have not responded, please respond immediately. The responses to the survey will be critical to understanding the needs and responding to them.</p>\n<p>You can find general information on teaching continuity here . More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found here .</p>\n<p>. More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found . We are working to identify and support any students who might have connectivity or other assistance needs in accessing online instruction. As a reminder, while online classes will begin on March 19th, there will be no in-person classes between now and March 19th. That is, we are taking a pause in classes. Given that this is only 3 days (similar to snow days in the past), we are confident that we will complete the term with the teaching days available.</p>\n<p>Research continuity: We have plans in place to ensure research can continue.</p>\n<p>Faculty, staff, and postdocs engaged in research are permitted to continue that research. Principle Investigators can designate some of their laboratory staff and postdocs as essential to the continuity of their research.</p>\n<p>Graduate students whose research takes place in the University’s labs will continue to have access to those facilities in consultation with their faculty advisors. Graduate students with appointments as research assistants should be in touch with their faculty advisors to learn about any changes to the activities of their research group.</p>\n<p>We do not know how disruptive this virus will be and encourage anyone conducting research to begin planning for what to do if that research gets disrupted. We have created a research continuity website with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan.</p>\n<p>with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan. All PIs with an active open research grant have been reached individually. There will be additional guidance for social and behavioral sciences, as well as for patient care-based clinical trials, shortly.</p>\n<p>We are suspending all international and non-essential domestic University travel, effective immediately and continuing at least through April 15th.</p>\n<p>International Travel for University business</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, we are prohibiting all University-related international travel by faculty and staff. If you require an exception, please submit a request to the Provost’s office at COVIDTravel@virginia.edu. Requests will require an endorsement of the employee’s dean, vice president, vice provost, or manager.</p>\n<p>Domestic Travel for University business</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, we are suspending all non-essential domestic travel. Essential travel is defined as supporting activities that are absolutely necessary, cannot be rescheduled, and must be done in person. If a supervisor, associate dean, or dean deems the travel essential, it will be reimbursed.

We will continue to share as much information as possible as soon as we can, and we will do our best to answer any questions that may come up. Please continue to visit the University’s Novel Coronavirus website, which is updated regularly and provides answers to many frequently asked questions.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>March 11: University Moves All Courses Online, Urges Students to Return Home</p>\n<p>To the University community,</p>\n<p>I write to share an update on our response to the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, and our plans for the remainder of the Spring semester.</p>\n<p>To begin with the basic and important news:</p>\n<p>We will be moving our classes online. We will not be holding classes on Grounds for the foreseeable future, quite possibly through the end of the semester. We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date.</p>\n<p>We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date. Online classes will begin Thursday, March 19.</p>\n<p>Students who are away on Spring Break are strongly encouraged to return home or to remain home if they are already there.</p>\n<p>Students on Grounds and in Charlottesville are strongly encouraged to return home by this weekend .</p>\n<p>. University events with more than 100 people are prohibited for the foreseeable future and should be postponed, cancelled, or offered virtually.</p>\n<p>These are obviously significant steps that will cause disruption and disappointment, which we all regret. We nonetheless feel compelled to take these steps in light of the most recent evidence. The virus continues to spread nationally and in Virginia. We still do not yet have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, so our risk remains relatively low. Given that fact, the easiest and least disruptive option would have been to bring all students back to Grounds as planned and hope to make it through the rest of the semester without a confirmed case. We also considered bringing students back and moving only large classes online.</p>\n<p>After talking more with medical experts, however, and as the evidence of the spread here and abroad mounts, we believe that these approaches would not be sufficient and would create too much risk, especially for our health system and the medical center, which is a Level 1 trauma center and may be stretched to the limits in the coming weeks and months. Experts have also told us that the best time to take steps to prevent that spread is now, before the first case arrives.</p>\n<p>Our approach here is guided by three goals: (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. All of those goals are advanced by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds. We cannot eliminate all risks, of course, but we believe at this time these steps will help mitigate the risks we face.</p>\n<p>To be clear, the University – including university buildings and UVA Health – will remain open, and we will bring students back to Grounds as soon as we can do so safely. While we hope to do so before the end of the semester, we may not be able to and are working on a number of contingency plans, including plans for graduation.</p>\n<p>A few notes for specific groups:</p>\n<p>Students</p>\n<p>If you are currently away on Spring Break, we strongly encourage you to stay home or return to your home . Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>. Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming. If you are currently in Charlottesville, we strongly encourage you to return home .</p>\n<p>This strong request applies to all students regardless of where you are living – whether on Grounds or off.</p>\n<p>whether on Grounds or off. We recognize that some students cannot go home, for a variety of reasons, ranging from the fact that their hometowns or countries are not safe to the fact that their only homes are in Charlottesville. We will continue to provide housing for students living on Grounds who genuinely cannot return home, and we will continue to provide dining services, though they will be modified. We will also offer assistance to students on financial aid who need help in returning to their homes.</p>\n<p>With the help and creativity of faculty and staff, we will make sure you are able to meet your academic requirements remotely, and we will pay special attention to graduating students. You will be hearing from deans and professors over the next week with details about your classes, including any clinical, experiential, performance-based, or studio learning that may require alternative arrangements.</p>\n<p>Faculty</p>\n<p>All faculty will be hearing from their deans soon with more details about moving classes online.</p>\n<p>We are standing up a team to provide the necessary training and technology to move courses online.</p>\n<p>While some research will be put on hold, we have plans in place to allow core research operations to continue. Those of you who are conducting research will be hearing from our Provost, Liz Magill, and our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian, with more details soon.</p>\n<p>Staff</p>\n<p>For the time being, staff should continue reporting to work as usual and take the recommended steps to prevent illness. A full list can be found here .</p>\n<p>. Staff with questions or concerns about their workplaces and the possibility of telecommuting should speak with their supervisors. We ask that staff who are feeling sick to please remain at home.</p>\n<p>Events</p>\n<p>Effective immediately and until further notice, we are suspending all university-sponsored events that involve more than 100 people.</p>\n<p>For events that involve fewer than 100 people, we strongly recommend alternatives to having an in-person event and, if that is not possible, taking all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of infection. We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.</p>\n<p>At this time, these restrictions do not apply to athletic events or events at JPJ, both of which remain under discussion and consideration.</p>\n<p>We realize you will likely have questions, both about this decision and about COVID-19 in general. Starting today, you can go to this website for more information, and we have set up a call center (Domestic: 877-685-4836; International: +1 202-800-2408) with staff trained to answer the most common questions. We will also be sending out more detailed communications about various elements of this plan, which we will also post on the website. As this is an evolving situation, we will also provide updates if there are significant changes to the plan outlined in this email.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank the teams from across the University who have been working incredibly hard over the last few weeks, and who will keep working hard to make this transition as smooth as possible. I am deeply grateful that UVA is home to so many expert, capable people who are dedicated to the well-being of our community and to our critical missions of teaching, research, and clinical care.</p>\n<p>I would also like to thank all of you for your patience and understanding. Put simply, UVA has never encountered something quite like this. There is no roadmap for trying to put most of the University curriculum online in a week. But I have enormous faith in this community – in your resilience, your willingness to do your part to keep others safe, and your ability to make the most of a very difficult situation.</p>\n<p>I have special faith in our students, for whom the health risks are generally low and for whom the disappointments are high, but who I know will recognize that now is the time to think first of the well-being of others.</p>\n<p>We are in this together, though I recognize that the impact will be uneven. As the father of a graduating senior at another university who has been asked to return home, I know this decision will hit our fourth-year students especially hard. It will also create economic challenges and hardships for some in the Charlottesville community whose livelihoods depend on our students. We will make it through this together by supporting each other, thinking creatively, and staying connected even if physically separated. I cannot pretend, obviously, that this is how I hoped this semester would unfold. No one can. But I eagerly await the ingenuity, compassion, and kindness that this common challenge will surely unlock within our community. If there were ever a time to be both great and good, this is surely it.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Jim</p>\n<hr>\n<p>James E. Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>March 8: Coronavirus Updates on University Preparedness, Travel, and Operations</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University community on March 8.</p>\n<p>Dear members of the University community:</p>\n<p>Like all of you, I am concerned about the presence of the novel coronavirus in the United States and abroad and its potential effect on students, families, employees, and community members. I write today to share the latest information we have and some decisions we have made to look out for the wellbeing of our University community and the greater Charlottesville region.</p>\n<p>There has not been a case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, but the Virginia Department of Health has confirmed two cases of COVID-19 in the Commonwealth, both in Northern Virginia. Our immediate risk remains low. The situation, however, is rapidly evolving, much remains unknown about the threats posed by COVID-19, and we take very seriously the responsibility to make prudent choices for the wellbeing of our community. A cross-university team continues to meet regularly to share information in real-time, consider changes in approach that will best protect our community, and set plans in motion for a wide variety of contingencies. I am in contact with them daily, and Provost Magill and I will continue to regularly update the community, through messages and on our website, about what we know and our plans.</p>\n<p>Consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Department of State, and the Virginia Department of Health, we have decided to enact the following restrictions and guidelines on University-related travel in order to help to mitigate our community’s risk of exposure to the virus:</p>\n<p>International Travel</p>\n<p>University-related travel to countries where the CDC has enacted level 3, or the State Department has enacted levels 3 or 4 is prohibited.CDC travel guidance related to COVID-19 is available here.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff who have exceptional reasons to travel to those countries may submit a petition to the Provost’s office via an email to COVIDtravel@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>International travel to restricted areas without an approved petition will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>If you travel or have recently traveled to one of these countries, we expect you to follow CDC guidance about self-isolation: stay home for a period of 14 days upon your return and seek medical attention if you experience fever, coughs, or difficulty breathing.</p>\n<p>Domestic Travel</p>\n<p>At this point, we are not prohibiting university-related domestic travel, but we strongly discourage all University travel (both domestic and international) for non-essential purposes, particularly that by air, to large gatherings, and to areas experiencing high numbers of COVID-19 cases, as documented by the CDC. If you must travel, please take all possible precautions before traveling, including staying up to date on the latest spread of the virus and considering difficulties you may encounter in returning home, especially when traveling internationally.</p>\n<p>These guidelines will be effective immediately and will be in place until at least April 15. Before April 15, we will re-assess and determine whether these policies will continue.</p>\n<p>While these guidelines apply to University-related travel, we ask members of the community to apply similar judgment in considering personal travel commitments, both internationally and domestically.</p>\n<p>Spring Break and Beyond</p>\n<p>Many of our students are currently away on Spring Break, so the pace of events on Grounds has slowed for the week ahead. Unless local conditions change, University sponsored events, programs, tours, and operations will continue as planned during Spring Break. We will continue to monitor this issue carefully, relying on guidance from internal experts at UVA Health, the Virginia Department of Health, and the CDC.</p>\n<p>We will write again by the middle of the week with additional updates regarding University programming during the weeks following Spring Break. At this point in time, we plan for students to return to Grounds and to resume classes, but we will be making some modifications to mitigate against the risk of exposure to and transmission of the virus, which we will explain in more detail by mid-week.</p>\n<p>This is a challenging time for our community, the nation, and the world as we respond to COVID-19 and the uncertainty surrounding it. We will do our best to stay on top of this quickly evolving situation, and to communicate with you regularly and fully as conditions change. I am grateful to all of you for your understanding and flexibility, and for your commitment to the wellbeing of our community. This is a time for our community to come together, and acting together, I remain confident in our ability to navigate this difficult and uncertain period.</p>\n<p>For more information, please consult our website, which we are continually updating.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 3: Important Updates Related to Spring Break and Student, Faculty and Staff Travel</p>\n<p>The following message to the University community was delivered March 3.</p>\n<p>Dear members of the UVA community:</p>\n<p>Since our last University-wide communication on February 28, the number of national coronavirus (COVID-19) cases continues to rise. While we are not aware of any cases in Virginia, the safety of the UVA and Charlottesville communities is our primary concern. I write to share with you the proactive steps we are taking. Note that this guidance is subject to change as the situation is rapidly evolving. You can find updates and resources on the University’s website.</p>\n<p>Spring Break Study Abroad</p>\n<p>The University has canceled all outbound study abroad programs scheduled over spring break. We notified affected faculty program directors and students today. Schools will work directly with students to arrange for completion of coursework through alternative means.</p>\n<p>Our decision on spring break trips was guided by the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) March 1st recommendation that Universities should reconsider study abroad travel. It is in everyone’s best interest that students avoid unnecessary travel through crowded transportation hubs for short visits to uncertain environments before they return to Grounds. We feel this is the best decision to protect our students and our local community where students will return after their travel.</p>\n<p>We are in close, regular communication with those students who are currently abroad on exchange and other programs, regarding how to monitor and assess their current situations based on conditions in the country they are visiting.</p>\n<p>Travel Guidance</p>\n<p>The CDC maintains a Travel Information website related to COVID-19, and specifically recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to countries at Warning Level 3. Note that these ratings can change rapidly.</p>\n<p>We urge faculty, staff, and students who have personal or professional plans to travel either internationally or to affected areas in the U.S. to reconsider their travel. In doing so, we ask each of you to take into account the possibility of travel delays, future quarantines, or prolonged self-isolation when returning from travel to the UVA and Charlottesville communities.</p>\n<p>If you have travel insurance, you should closely review your plan to assure it does not exclude pandemics in the case of need for medical evacuation.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage faculty and staff to share any travel plans with your department chair, dean, or manager in order to facilitate University assistance if the need arises.</p>\n<p>We strongly urge student organizations (CIOs) to share any travel plans with the Office of the Dean of Students.</p>\n<p>The decisions we are making rely heavily on the guidance we are receiving from the CDC and the Virginia Department of Health and are intended to protect the health and welfare of our faculty, staff, students, and local community. We recognize the uncertainty this global health issue is creating and are committed to keep you informed and up to date as this situation evolves. You may find updates and current information on the University’s website and FAQ.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>Feb. 28: Message of Solidarity from Provost Magill</p>\n<p>The following message to Chinese faculty, students, staff and scholars was delivered Feb. 28.</p>\n<p>Dear colleagues:</p>\n<p>Today I’m writing to you – our esteemed faculty, staff, and scholars from China – to express the University’s concern and support for you as the coronavirus continues to spread in China and beyond. We understand how worried you must be about your family and friends who are contending with the virus and its effects. As an expression of our support, we made this video, and we have shared it widely with members of our UVA family who are in China.</p>\n<p>UVA officials are carefully monitoring the spread of the virus and listening closely to advice and directives coming from the CDC, the Virginia Department of Health, and the federal government. We are offering online resources via the coronavirus website and through the coronavirus FAQs, which we are updating frequently. If you have questions or concerns that are not addressed in these materials, please call our faculty and staff coronavirus phone line at 434-297-4027.</p>\n<p>We have heard that some of you feel an obligation to offer support to students from China who are here at UVA. We are grateful for your willingness to comfort and advise our students in this way; at the same time, we realize that this responsibility may feel overwhelming. In addition to using the resources above, students can reach counselors at CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) at 434-243-5150, 24 hours a day. The International Studies Office (ISO) is also available to assist students who are studying here from abroad, and we have support resources available for faculty and staff through the Faculty &#x26; Employee Assistance Program.</p>\n<p>As we continue to contend with the coronavirus, please know that we are thinking of you and your families, friends, and colleagues, and we are committed to providing the support you need during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Warmly,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>Feb. 26: Update on Coronavirus for UVA Students</p>\n<p>The following message to University students was delivered Feb. 26:</p>\n<p>Important Reminders: Spring Break Health and Safety</p>\n<p>To: All Students</p>\n<p>From: Allen W. Groves, University Dean of Students</p>\n<p>odos@virginia.edu</p>\n<p>Dear Students:</p>\n<p>Since many of you soon will be leaving Charlottesville for Spring Break, I am writing with several important reminders about health and safety.</p>\n<p>If you follow the news, you already know the global coronavirus outbreak is a major concern for anyone considering international travel at this time. The virus has spread to areas of the world beyond China with an accelerating and unpredictable trajectory. This threat will likely grow. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced this week that the virus is expected to impact the United States in a more severe way than it has to date.</p>\n<p>Traveling abroad – whether for study or leisure – carries a number of potential risks. Even a country not currently experiencing an outbreak could suddenly be declared a high-risk area, resulting in heightened exposure to the virus, difficulty with departure, immigration barriers in returning to the U.S., and even possible restrictions on returning to Grounds. The University strongly recommends not traveling to locations with CDC or State Department Level 3 alerts or higher. While we have not cancelled any current or existing study abroad programs, the University will cancel any such programs, even if already under way, at any location for which the CDC sets a warning level 3, or the State Department sets a warning level 3 or 4.</p>\n<p>The seasonal flu also is present in many areas. Basic measures remain the best defense against coronavirus, flu, and other communicable diseases:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with soapy water.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Cough and sneeze into a tissue or your elbow.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>TRAVEL PREPARATION</p>\n<p>The CDC maintains a travel information website for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>\n<p>for coronavirus (COVID-19).

As we experience a global pandemic that is expected to worsen in coming days in our area of the country, the University is joining with entities at the local, regional and state level to share resources that may be needed for the health and well-being of our fellow citizens.</p>\n<p>You and your student already are making personal sacrifices that none of us fully envisioned even a month ago. I’m writing today to thank you for all you are doing and to share more information about plans that will have an impact on a small contingent of students and their families. Although this does not affect all of you, I believe it’s important for all of our students and families to understand what – and why – certain decisions have been made in recent days.</p>\n<p>As a state institution with a public trust and mission, we have a duty to share our resources in times of crisis. Our facilities are owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia. It’s our good fortune that the UVA Hospital, a nationally renowned, level one trauma center, is part of our extended Grounds. We offer major resources that can help those suffering from COVID-19 and other illnesses, as well as assist the many doctors, nurses and staff members who are caring for them. Our resources are part of the bigger picture that emergency planners are reviewing to determine a comprehensive, joint response to aid the Central Virginia area.</p>\n<p>At the same time these plans are evolving, we must adhere to medical guidance and concerns for the safety and health of you, your families, our staff members and people in Charlottesville. Many of you have understandably wanted to return to the Grounds to pick up your students’ belongings if they lived in a residence hall. That simply is not possible given all the current concerns about the spread of COVID-19. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, but only when consistent with public health and safety.</p>\n<p>The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds. We are in contact with the some 250 undergraduate students who remain so they are aware of how to access services if they need help.</p>\n<p>Emergency Use of Bond, Bice, Shea, French and Spanish Houses. As part of the overall efforts addressing the COVID-19 crisis, the University recently was asked to provide housing in residence halls near the hospital. The buildings include Bice, Bond, Shea, and the French and Spanish houses. This weekend, eight students who had remained in those five buildings were relocated to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley, located on the opposite side of Grounds.</p>\n<p>As part of this process to answer the call of projected emergency needs, we now must carefully pack up and store all the possessions of students who had lived in those five buildings. The residents of those buildings received an email with details on Sunday and are being asked to complete a questionnaire to help direct the vendor we have retained for packing, moving and storage. A second email further clarifying the process was distributed yesterday. Students who received the questionnaire need to complete it by tomorrow, April 8, so the vendor can handle students’ possessions as carefully as possible and in accordance with their preferences.</p>\n<p>The University is covering the full cost of packing and storing items from these five buildings. Students only need to pay if they want to go to the storage warehouse and pick up their belongings before some point in the future when conditions are safer and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has lifted the stay-home order issued last week. Once a timeframe is set, the vendor will deliver everyone’s packed belongings to a central area of the Grounds where students and parents can pick them up. A range of dates and times for pick-up will be available.</p>\n<p>Governor Northam’s Executive Order. If you live in Virginia, then you know Gov. Northam issued an Executive Order last week directing Virginians to stay at home until June 10. This order, and previous guidance from the governor and other officials, has guided our decisions since mid-March about students returning to Grounds.</p>\n<p>The majority of our students are no longer in Charlottesville. A significant number, however, remain in off-Grounds apartments or houses. By and large, they are following social distancing guidelines and not gathering in groups larger than 10. I have seen exceptions, however, most notably on the UVA Lawn. Enjoying the beautiful spring weather is certainly not a problem, but if you think your student needs a reminder about not gathering in groups larger than 10, please help us out. It’s for their own safety and that of others. The asymptomatic spread of the novel coronavirus poses major concerns.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal Deadline Extended. For students only in the College of Arts &#x26; Sciences, the date to withdraw from the spring term has been changed to May 8 (it had previously been April 14). All College students now have until May 8 to withdraw from the spring 2020 term and return in fall 2020 (or summer). Students in the College have received a notification about this.</p>\n<p>Message from Dean Groves. All students received a message yesterday from University Dean of Students Allen Groves. He reminded students of the importance of social distancing and covered several other important topics, including the possibility of unemployment benefits for students who had part-time jobs and are now having difficulty paying rent or other major expenses. He also listed the many services available remotely, including the services of Student Health and Counseling &#x26; Psychological Services. I encourage you to read his message and ensure your student reads it.</p>\n<p>The University is committed to sharing updates with you as information is available, but we remain in a fluid situation marked by numerous uncertainties. Thank you for all you are doing to support your student as they finish this semester remotely. I hope you and your families are weathering this crisis as well as possible.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>April 6: Ryan Announces Emergency Fund to Assist Contract Workers, UVA Employees</p>\n<p>The following email was distributed to members of the University community on Monday:</p>\n<p>To the University community:</p>\n<p>I am writing to let you know about efforts we are making to support workers furloughed by our contractors and about a contribution to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation.</p>\n<p>A core aspiration of our strategic plan is to be a university that is both great and good. Toward that end, we have committed to doing our best to be a good neighbor and to live our values. That means, among other things, doing what we can to support our most vulnerable community members.</p>\n<p>We have kept our employees on our payroll, and we will continue to do so for as long as we can. Some of our contractors, including Aramark, have furloughed their employees. More may do so in the future. These workers are entitled to state and federal unemployment benefits, as well as some benefits being offered directly by their employers.</p>\n<p>It has become clear that these benefits are not flowing as quickly as any of us would like, and that our contract workers need immediate assistance. It is also clear that there may be a gap between the relief available from unemployment benefits and meeting the necessities of life. Our own employees may also be facing unexpected costs due to the crisis we are all facing.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we are devoting $2 million to create an emergency assistance fund for UVA contract workers and employees. We cannot provide a salary or wages to those who have been furloughed, because doing so would make them ineligible for the state and federal benefits that exist for those who are unemployed. But we can provide funding to help meet an array of needs related to the crisis. Our primary focus will be to help those who have been furloughed, but this fund will also be available for those still employed and facing unexpected costs.</p>\n<p>We will also be providing assistance to furloughed contract workers who need help in applying for state and federal unemployment benefits, and we expect this fund to be a helpful bridge to those who are awaiting benefits. We will keep this fund operational until June 1, and we will reassess at that point.</p>\n<p>We will have more details to share by mid-week, including a timeline and process for accessing the funds. A number of you have contacted me about helping out your colleagues, and I’m grateful for your interest and compassion. To facilitate that help, we are setting up a process for employees to donate directly to this fund.</p>\n<p>We are also committed to being a good neighbor to the Charlottesville region. For that reason, we are also contributing $1 million to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation to support their efforts to stabilize households during this pandemic. The Foundation has already raised over $2.3 million to support these efforts, and they are doing great work and deserve our support. For anyone who needs immediate assistance, please call their Community Resource Helpline at 434-234-4490.</p>\n<p>We will have more to say later this week about additional steps we are going to take to support our community, but I did not want to wait to get this information out. We face challenges ahead. We will only get through them by working together and doing what we can to support each other. Thanks for all of your efforts in that regard.</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>April 5: Update from the Dean of Students</p>\n<p>Dear Undergraduate, Graduate and Professional School Students:</p>\n<p>I’m writing today to offer updates on a few subjects, and also to check in on you. As April begins, it’s still somewhat difficult to fully grasp all that has occurred over the past few weeks. I imagine you are feeling a range of emotions. I hope as you deal with this upheaval in your life you will take some time for self-care and reflection. If you are spending major portions of your day in front of a computer instead of in a classroom or research lab or library with the friends, advisors, colleagues, and the routines you had come to enjoy, social isolation can be a real problem. Feelings of distance, loneliness, and even depression can result. Many of us feel a bit of “cabin fever” and that’s quite natural. Things as simple as taking a long walk and enjoying nature can help in dealing with the uncertainty everyone is feeling now.</p>\n<p>I urge you to stay connected with your friends and whoever else lifts your spirits. Prioritize your health, including getting adequate sleep, moving your muscles, and eating nutritiously. If you would like to speak with a counselor at any point, we continue to offer services through CAPS and Student Health remotely. Please see the end of this message for resources and contact information.</p>\n<p>If you are having difficulty with your courses, either because of the material, online delivery, or other issue, please reach out for help. If you are an undergraduate student, please call on your professor, teaching assistant, academic advisor, association dean (if in the College), or perhaps engage with a tutor or peer. Graduate and professional students should reach out to their professor, advisor, research director, department chair, or academic dean.</p>\n<p>• Governor Northam’s Executive Order. The warm spring weather can be a soothing antidote to stress, but it carries a risk as well. It remains very important to practice social distancing and abide by local directives. While it will be tempting to gather outside in groups, it is essential that you follow orders like those issued by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to maintain social distancing and only go out for essential needs. The Governor’s most recent Executive Order directs Virginians to stay at home through June 10. This does not preclude going out for a walk, for example, but if you go with a few friends, you should be mindful of keeping a distance of at least six feet between you. No groups of 10 or more can gather outside or elsewhere in Virginia, on public or private property. Many other states have similar restrictions aimed at “flattening the curve” and avoiding larger scale COVID-19 infections that may overwhelm our health care system.</p>\n<p>• Doing Our Part. We know the COVID-19 crisis is worsening in most of the country, including in Virginia. University leaders are responding by turning significant attention to our health system and standing ready to support the consolidated, joint efforts of emergency teams in the Charlottesville community and larger central Virginia area. As a state institution with a public trust and mission, it is our duty to respond to requests for use of our facilities and resources at the local, regional, state, and national levels.</p>\n<p>• Emergency Use of Residence Halls. Within the past few days, we have responded to requests from emergency planners to make residence hall space available near the UVA Hospital. The 15 undergraduate students who still resided in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses have been relocated this weekend, with help from the teams in Housing &#x26; Residence Life and Facilities Management, to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley. Additionally, students who had been living in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses – but had left Charlottesville previously – have been notified that the University will be carefully packing and storing their belongings at no cost to students, so the buildings can be used to support needs arising from this crisis. (Students can also choose to have their belongings shipped to them at their expense.)</p>\n<p>This crisis bears similarities to war efforts of the past when citizens had to make sacrifices and pull together for the greater good. I regret some decisions have come very quickly with little advance communication, but the situation is exceptionally fluid right now and the University is part of larger efforts with new priorities emerging daily. Whenever possible, we are committed to communicating with you in advance and as fully as possible. We will always endeavor not simply to tell you what action is being taken, but also why.</p>\n<p>• Retrieving Belongings from the Residence Halls. Given medical guidance and concerns for the health of you, your families, and people in Charlottesville, it will not be possible for students who were living in residence halls to come back to the Grounds at this time to retrieve personal possessions from on-Grounds residences. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, and only when consistent with public health and safety. The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds.</p>\n<p>• Support for International Students. Of special note is that many of the undergraduate and graduate students remaining on Grounds and in our Charlottesville community are international students. We recognize the special challenges they face being far from home. We communicated last week with all students remaining on Grounds and emphasized how they can access needed services. For our international students in particular, we want to underscore our condemnation of, and resolve to combat, any acts of bias or xenophobia against them. If you have been the target of such an act, please report it through the University’s Just Report It system. Of course, if you believe you are ever in immediate danger, you should always call 911.</p>\n<p>• Financial Hardships. Without question, the coronavirus crisis is taking an economic toll on many, including our students, faculty and staff, and their families. The University is examining how costs and losses are affecting our operations. This includes the recognition that some families who have been hit especially hard may need to update their financial information with Student Financial Services for purposes of calculating institutional aid and access to other resources.</p>\n<p>Many students have expressed considerable concern about losing their wages from part-time jobs, affecting their ability to pay rent and other major expenses. Please note, the Student Legal Services office, which is staffed by attorney Lester Wilson and funded by the Student Activity Fee, may be a resource to assist you. More information is available on the Student Legal Services website.</p>\n<p>New federal legislation may also grant part-time student workers eligibility for unemployment benefits through the Virginia Employment Commission. Students who had part-time jobs, but are currently unemployed, can apply now on the VEC website. Applicants will need to renew their claims weekly, preferably Mondays through Wednesdays. The VEC website states VEC is still awaiting guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, so the timing of funding is uncertain. If you are a part-time student worker who lost your job in another state, you should apply using that state’s website to seek unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p>We are grateful to our graduate students for the support they continue to provide to the University’s core missions of teaching and research. For those students who are serving as Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs), the University’s policy on continuity of pay is noted on the Human Resources website. During the spring term, GTAs continue in their roles of working with faculty in teaching remotely for the remainder of the semester, while GRAs and research fellows continue to work with their faculty advisors and supervisors to engage in the activities of their research groups, including continuing research remotely to the extent possible. We know how disruptive this pandemic has been to the academic careers of our graduate students. The Provost and the Vice President for Research continue to work with the deans and faculty to find ways to ensure the success of our graduate students during this time of disruption in their education and research.</p>\n<p>Emergency funding continues to be available for all students in need. As a reminder, three forms of funding are available:</p>\n<p>• Final Exercises. Having walked the Lawn myself as a graduating student, I fully recognize the importance of walking the Lawn for our graduating students and their families. Last month, President Ryan asked Pam Higgins, Executive Director for Major Events in the President’s Office, and me to lead a working group of undergraduate and graduate students and representatives from the schools to recommend ways for a meaningful celebration still to occur on the Lawn. We hope to present recommendations soon to President Ryan and his senior leadership team. You should expect to hear directly from President Ryan on this topic in the coming weeks, as he is committed to seeing this through for you.</p>\n<p>• Providing Support. Many of you have expressed interest in supporting the University Health System and our local community, and we have seen many gestures of generosity. If you would like to learn more about how you can support the care needs of the Health System, please visit their website.</p>\n<p>With six weeks remaining in the semester, I hope to communicate several more times before everyone finishes the term. I personally want to stay connected with you, and I feel it is important for you to receive regular updates about important student topics and how the University is responding to the coronavirus crisis.</p>\n<p>I wish the best to each of you and your families.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Allen W.

But I realize many of you may be wondering about Governor Northam’s Executive Order, which was released this afternoon. So before I get to the summer programs, let me say a few words about the Governor’s Executive Order.</p>\n<p>The order requires all Virginia residents to remain at home, unless they are traveling to and from work or seeking essential services like medical care, food, or banking. Institutions of higher education, like UVA, “shall cease all in-person classes and instruction, and cancel all gatherings of more than ten individuals. For purposes of facilitating remote learning, performing critical research, or performing essential functions, institutions of higher education may continue to operate, provided that social distancing requirements are maintained.”</p>\n<p>This order is consistent with the decisions we have made over the last few weeks and will not change the way we are currently operating. If more changes become necessary, we will let you know.</p>\n<p>As far as this summer is concerned, in keeping with our decisions about this semester, we have decided to cancel all in-person summer programs through June 30th, 2020. “Summer programs” include classes, conferences, camps, and other events that are scheduled to occur on Grounds through June 30th.</p>\n<p>This means that classes offered during Summer Session 1 and 2 will move online. You can find more information about Summer Session at <a href=\"https://summer.virginia.edu/\">https://summer.virginia.edu/</a>. By June 1st, we will make a decision about in-person summer programs occurring after July 1st.</p>\n<p>As always, please visit <a href=\"https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus</a> for the most up-to-date information on our response to COVID-19 and answers to frequently asked questions. I hope that you and yours are safe and healthy.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>March 23: Provost Clarifies the State of Research and Warns of Potential Shutdown</p>\n<p>Dear UVA Faculty and those involved in the research enterprise:</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience as we work together to tackle this fast-moving and complex public health crisis. We understand this has been a difficult period, including for those engaged in the important task of research, whether they do their work in a lab or in an office or in the field. As you know, last week, the University announced extraordinary measures to “flatten the curve” even as we work to continue our missions of teaching, research, and clinical care. The following day, the University announced that these measures apply to the research enterprise.</p>\n<p>This message follows up on this March 20 communication from our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian. I write to: i) provide two reminders; ii) to clarify the University’s approach to the engagement of graduate students in research during this period; and iii) to emphasize that all engaged in the research enterprise should be preparing for the possibility of a shutdown of ongoing research and resorting only to the maintenance of key laboratory assets.</p>\n<p>First, two reminders:</p>\n<p>I want to reaffirm the University position on research: As announced last week, the research enterprise should be shifting to key functions only – and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked here . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school.</p>\n<p>– and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school. In keeping with the University-wide approach to “flattening the curve”: All employees, including those engaged in the research enterprise, who can work from home, must work from home and their supervisor (here, PI) must require that they do so. Like all managers, a PI can “designate” a category of employees who must report in person to perform key functions. In keeping with efforts to “flatten the curve,” this category must be as small as possible to perform those tasks and the PI must assure that the safest practices are followed.</p>\n<p>Second, regarding the role of graduate students in the days ahead:</p>\n<p>As a matter of principle, the University position is that graduate students are – first and foremost – students . We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future.</p>\n<p>. We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future. Given their status as students, the rule is this: a faculty member is not permitted to “designate” a graduate student, which would mean that the graduate student must report in person to perform key tasks. This rule is subject to narrow exceptions (decided through a process described below) if the PI/Research Leader and graduate student jointly request an exception.</p>\n<p>Exceptions : I will, after consulting with others (the relevant school dean, the VPR, and the EVPHA) determine whether an exception to this rule will be granted. Petitions to permit a graduate student to continue in-person work should be submitted by the PI and as the form indicates with the consent of the graduate student to the Provost’s Office by using this form.</p>\n<p>Third, it is critical that all PIs/Research Leaders plan for a shutdown of ongoing research. We do not know if or when that might occur; as has happened in some other states, it is possible that the decision will be required by a government order over which we have little control. Given this, it is crucial that researchers have a plan to preserve the vital material that is essential for research (for example, animals, cells, continuously run instruments and machines, special materials, and reagents). This task of preservation and planning will assure that, if we must pause our ongoing research, we will be positioned to return to this important endeavor whenever the pause is over. Believe me, all of us wish we could predict if and when we might have to shut down ongoing research; but we do not yet know. I assure you that we will continue to keep the UVA research community up to date in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and generosity of spirit during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 19: New Cases of COVID-19 Includes UVA Student</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University community on March 19:</p>\n<p>Dear University community:</p>\n<p>Earlier today the Virginia Department of Health confirmed three new cases of COVID-19 in the Charlottesville area.</p>\n<p>One of those cases is a UVA student who lives off Grounds in Albemarle County. The student, who is believed to have contracted the virus during recent international travel, is in isolation and receiving care following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish this student a speedy recovery during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort, with the assistance of University officials, to identify people who were in contact with this individual, reaching out to those individuals and arranging for their self-isolation, if necessary.</p>\n<p>The health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority. We realize a case of COVID-19 within our student body creates a heightened sense of anxiety and concern. The University coronavirus page offers a number of resources to help community members stay healthy and to cope with the strain this period is placing on all of us.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, as we work together to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>Additional information is available from the CDC.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, please respond to this email at covidinformation@virginia.edu or call 877-685-4836 (domestic) or 1-202-800-2408 (international).</p>\n<p>We have posted notification of this recent case on the UVA Coronavirus website. As a result of the expected spread of the coronavirus and the development of additional testing capacity, there will likely be additional cases in the coming days. We will not be emailing about each of them, but our default will be to post notifications of new cases to the coronavirus website and to email about new cases sparingly.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for your continued support and compassion during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Christopher P. Holstege, M.D.</p>\n<p>Department of Student Health &#x26; Wellness</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>March 18: Provost Outlines Undergraduate Grading Policy for Online Courses</p>\n<p>Dear UVA faculty, students, and staff:</p>\n<p>We are facing extraordinary challenges as a result of COVID-19. As the letter President Ryan and I shared yesterday made clear, this has required rapid and consequential decision making. In seeking to fulfill our academic mission, our guiding principles are clear: We will work to protect our University community and our neighbors, and we will do all we can to continue educating our students and pursuing our research. The effort to sustain our educational mission has required enormous effort and creativity by thousands of faculty and staff. As we launch tomorrow into our rapid transition from in-person to online instruction for the remainder of this semester, I am writing to provide direction on how we will handle grading for undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>For this semester, for our undergraduate schools, credit/no credit (CR/NC) will be the default grading system for all classes where the work is not yet completed; students will also, however, have the option to receive a letter grade. Students must decide whether to receive a letter grade by the last day of spring semester classes, Tuesday, April 28th. We will be in touch about the process for making that choice as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Several other details are important:</p>\n<p>Courses taken for CR/NC during Spring 2020 will count toward curricular, major, and graduation requirements. Such grades are not factored into a student’s GPA. Students who remain in the CR/NC option must complete the class with a grade of C or better to receive credit.</p>\n<p>This policy applies only to undergraduate level courses. The deans of the graduate and professional programs are considering how they will approach this question, and they will soon announce their decisions to their schools.</p>\n<p>UVA will include a designation on students’ transcripts to indicate that the CR/NC option was created in the midst of an extraordinary crisis and as part of the University’s effort to manage the transition to online instruction.</p>\n<p>These are not ordinary times. Every day, I am struck anew by the enormity of the challenges and the enormity of the effort being brought to bear to meet those challenges. As we resume the semester with online courses tomorrow, I want to thank all of you for your ingenuity, understanding, and patience. I remain confident in our collective ability to navigate this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 18: Provost Outlines Guidance for Maintaining Research Continuity</p>\n<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>\n<p>I write to provide an update on our approach to research, as promised in yesterday's University message. In consultation with President Ryan, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Craig Kent, and Vice President for Research Ram Ramasubramanian, the following principles are guiding our efforts on research. Research, like education, is central to the University's mission. Similar to our extraordinary effort to move classes online, we are taking dramatic steps to respond to this public health crisis while continuing our research mission.</p>\n<p>In keeping with, and directly quoting, yesterday’s message: “All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools, or UVA Health.” This directive applies to all University employees. Like managers across Grounds, Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers “have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.”</p>\n<p>We all remain grateful for your patience and partnership as we face these unprecedented times. In addition to the University’s coronavirus website, please visit the Vice President for Research website for specific resources and detailed guidance. Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers can find detailed research continuity guidelines here.</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 17: COVID-19 Causes Sweeping Changes to University Operations</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University Community on March 17:</p>\n<p>To the University community,</p>\n<p>We write with some important updates across a range of issues. As you know, this is an unprecedented and very rapidly changing situation, and all of us are learning more every day. At this point, it seems imperative that we do our very best to slow the progression of this virus in order to “flatten the curve” of those infected and avoid overwhelming our health system, which would ultimately risk our patients, our community, and our Charlottesville neighbors. This requires taking some significant, additional steps at this point.</p>\n<p>We realize and regret that these additional steps will cause more disappointment and call for more sacrifice, but we see no other way to do our part to help confront this public health crisis. We must also be mindful of the need of our students, their families, and our faculty and staff to plan, and we need to be mindful of protecting our faculty and staff, who make this place run. For all of those reasons, today we are announcing the following changes, including adjustments to classes, research, and events; guidance for employees; and modifications to services.</p>\n<p>These changes will go into effect immediately wherever possible, though we recognize that some may take a bit of time to implement fully, as explained more below.</p>\n<p>ADJUSTMENTS TO CLASSES, RESEARCH, AND EVENTS</p>\n<p>Classes will remain online throughout the semester. It is exceedingly unlikely, based on all that we know at this point, that this virus will have abated by the end of April. In light of the need for faculty, staff, and students to make plans, we are making the decision now – rather than waiting until April 5 – to not hold any classes on Grounds this semester. For students who do not have the technology needed to complete their classes online, please visit our technology support fund page and read the instructions and guidelines completely. We are in active discussions about what changes we might make to our normal grading system this semester. We will be back in touch soon, once we have made a decision.</p>\n<p>Final Exercises will not proceed as planned. In light of the evidence about the likely progression of the virus over the next couple of months, and when it will peak, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Final Exercises as currently planned. We did not make this decision lightly, as we know how disappointing it will be to graduating students and their families. That said, a team is already focused on developing creative alternatives to mark this important occasion, and we will communicate updates as we have them.</p>\n<p>All events on Grounds are cancelled, no matter the size, until at least May 15. We had originally cancelled events over 100, but on Sunday the CDC suggested no groups larger than 50, and just recently the White House and the Governor of Virginia suggested gatherings of no more than 10 people. Rather than continue to chase the ever-shrinking size limitations, we want to be clear that all events should be cancelled this semester. These restrictions include events that are not University-sponsored, but are planned to occur on Grounds, including conferences, symposia, and social gatherings. This does not preclude small internal meetings, where social distancing should be the touchstone.</p>\n<p>Research. Like our teaching mission, we are committed to continuing our research mission while making sure we take steps to keep members of our community safe. We will provide guidance on this by mid-day tomorrow, Wednesday, March 18.</p>\n<p>GUIDANCE FOR EMPLOYEES</p>\n<p>All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools or UVA Health. The latter includes, among others, faculty who need to come to their classrooms or offices to teach online, and UVA Health faculty and staff who need to care for patients and support patient services. The traditional categories of “designated” and “non-designated” are helpful but not entirely relevant here, given that those categories envisioned short delays due to weather problems. School leaders, unit supervisors, and managers have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.</p>\n<p>Employee Compensation and Benefits. We are committed to our employees. We are determined to ensure that the modifications to our operations caused by the coronavirus will not impact our existing commitments to compensate and continue existing benefits for UVA employees, whether part time or full time. We will, therefore, honor all existing commitments for the foreseeable future. The length of this crisis is difficult to predict at this point, as are the economic ramifications. There may come a point where we need to reassess in light of the length of time of the crisis or significantly changes circumstances, but our hope and plan is to weather this crisis together.</p>\n<p>To be clear, those who must report for work will have to do so. Those who can work remotely will have to do so. Those who fall into neither category may be asked to perform other functions for their units or schools or to take on tasks elsewhere at the University. Whether or not these employees are able to be re-deployed, we will honor existing employment commitments for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Contract Employees. We have relationships with a wide range of contractors across the University, which present a variety of situations. We are in active conversations with these contractors and hope to be able to provide an update fairly soon.</p>\n<p>Student Employees. This change in operations will have an impact on our student employees as well. Students who are teaching assistants or working on research will continue to be paid if they continue their work. Student employees who are able to complete their duties remotely can do so with the approval of their supervisor. Students should submit timesheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage. Student in the Federal Work Study program (FWS) will continue to be paid an average of their current wages bi-weekly through the end of the semester. Students on FWS who will continue to work remotely should submit time sheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage.</p>\n<p>For the safety of students and the others with whom they may come into contact, non FWS student employees who cannot work remotely will not be eligible to continue working while the University’s operating schedule is modified due to COVID-19. We understand that this will cause some students financial hardship, and we will do whatever we can to help. If you are in need of financial support, please connect with your supervisor, who has received a list of emergency financial resources available to displaced student employees.</p>\n<p>MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICES; CREDITS OR REFUNDS FOR HOUSING AND DINING</p>\n<p>On-Grounds Housing Will Be Further Restricted. As our resources and on-site staffing levels diminish due to social distancing directives, and due to increasing emphasis on the importance of social distancing, we will only be able to provide on-Grounds Housing for a very limited number of residents. Only students who have no other option will be permitted to remain on-Grounds. As a reminder, students who are returning solely to collect some of their belongings still have until Wednesday, March 18 at noon to do so. If you are not able to collect your belongings before then, please do not return to Grounds until you hear from us with guidance, which will be coming soon. We will provide details about when and how students will be able to gather all of their belongings.</p>\n<p>Any students who stayed in on-Grounds Housing following our initial request to return home must make plans to leave by Friday, March 20 unless they meet one of the following criteria: 1) international students who are unable to secure travel to return home; 2) persons for whom their on-Grounds residence is their only home (including graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff for whom their on-Grounds residence is their permanent address); or 3) students for whom traveling home would present a severe health or safety risk. Housing &#x26; Residence Life will contact students who completed the original survey to remain on Grounds, and work with them to transition back home. As before, students currently receiving financial aid with questions related to financial resources for departing Grounds should contact UVA Student Financial Services at sfs@virginia.edu or 434.982.6000.</p>\n<p>We are urging undergraduate and graduate students who live off-Grounds to follow these guidelines as well .</p>\n<p>Dining</p>\n<p>Dining options will be very limited. Effective immediately, Observatory Hill Dining Hall will serve as the only major dining facility in service, apart from those necessary to support UVA Health. Those using O-Hill can obtain their meals there but will not be able to eat inside the facility. Please visit the University’s Dining website for hours of operation and real-time updates. Wherever possible, we encourage students who have kitchens in their place of residence to prepare their own meals.</p>\n<p>Credits or Refunds for Housing and Dining</p>\n<p>We will provide pro-rated credits to student accounts for on-Grounds Housing and UVA dining contracts. We will send additional information on the mechanics of this process in a later communication, but students will have the ability to either request a refund or allow the credit to remain on their student account to apply to future bills. As long as students remain enrolled through the end of the spring semester, financial aid will not be impacted.</p>\n<p>We are making a number of modifications to various services. Dining services, as described above, will be limited to take out/grab and go only. All libraries will be closed, except to faculty and staff who need to use them for teaching online classes or clinical care. Student activity spaces, like those in Newcomb Hall, 1515, and the Student Activities Building, will be closed. All gyms and fitness facilities on Grounds will be closed. University venues such as the museums, the McCormick Observatory, and the Rotunda will be closed to the public. Bus service will be reduced. More details will be forthcoming with respect to all of these topics and will be posted on the University’s coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>This message covers sweeping changes that would usually be made only after months of consideration and discussion. In the face of this rapidly evolving public health crisis, however, we have been called to make the best decisions we can in a limited amount of time in order to look out for the health and safety of our community, both at the University and in the surrounding Charlottesville region. Implementing these changes will no doubt be difficult, and we know further questions will arise, but we remain as confident as ever in our community’s ability to navigate this unprecedented set of challenges together. In the meantime, our profound thanks to everyone in this community for your dedication, creativity, and compassion.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>March 17: UVA Outlines Child Care Options for Employees</p>\n<p>Dear UVA Health Community:</p>\n<p>To address the extensive caregiving needs created by the K-12 school closure, the University has expanded our caregiving support network.

At this point, some of you are probably trying to figure out how to support your family and your career while schools are closed, which is one of the reasons I’d like to share a brief reminder of our telecommuting policy.</p>\n<p>To begin, while most students are gone and online instruction will begin on Thursday, UVA remains open and operating – meaning faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. That said, our telecommuting policy is designed to give employees the flexibility to work remotely when necessary and possible.</p>\n<p>If you need to work remotely, please talk to your manager. I realize it may be difficult to take care of your families and work remotely at the same time, which is why I encourage flexibility and creativity from both employees and managers. I would also ask that managers please give your employees the option to work remotely – provided you are still able to keep your units open for business. As a reminder, any employee who is ill should go home immediately and seek appropriate medical attention.</p>\n<p>As we announced yesterday, two weeks of additional paid leave (Public Health Emergency Leave) is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member diagnosed with the disease. This leave, however, cannot be used for child care.</p>\n<p>Employees who must stay home to care for children while schools are closed and can’t work remotely should use University Time Off (University Staff) or the equivalent for classified staff. We offer benefits to assist with care for benefits-eligible employees who need temporary care and are looking into options for providing additional care options.</p>\n<p>We will notify you if we need to make any changes to our telecommuting policy and will post any new information in the Working Remotely section of the University’s Coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for everything you are doing for UVA – every day, and especially over the last few weeks. We could not do any of this without you, and I am profoundly grateful. Lastly, updates on the coronavirus generally and our response to it will be posted regularly on our coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Kelley Stuck</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer</p>\n<p>March 16: Confirmed Case of COVID-19 in University Community</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University Community on March 16:</p>\n<p>Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:</p>\n<p>As you know from the notification received earlier today, the University has confirmed a case of COVID-19 within our community. The individual who is ill, a staff member at the UVA Women’s Center who lives off Grounds, is receiving care and in quarantine at home following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish her a speedy and full recovery.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort to identify individuals who were in contact with the staff member, reaching out to those individuals, and arranging for their isolation. University staff are also working to support potentially impacted students, faculty and staff. In addition, the UVA Women’s Center is being vacated and deep-cleaned with products that kill the coronavirus in accordance with CDC guidelines.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. If you exhibit these symptoms, please contact your health care provider and follow their instructions before leaving your home and potentially putting others at risk:</p>\n<p>Students: Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.</p>\n<p>Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.

If you do not have a primary care physician you may call the Virginia Department of Heath hotline at 877-ASK-VDH3 (877-275-8343).</p>\n<p>As we work together as a community to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>Additional information is available from the CDC.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all you are doing during this challenging time to safeguard your own health and that of others.

You can also consult the University’s Novel Coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Given the progression of the virus, it is not a surprise to discover a local case, but we know it will heighten anxiety. We will be in further touch to announce any additional changes we are making as the situation unfolds, and we will continue to update the website. Now, more than ever, is the time to treat each other with kindness and compassion.

I realize you have been receiving a great many messages from the University this week, so I am going to highlight my most important points up front. First, if you can return to your home, we need you to do so as soon as possible. Second, if you are away from Grounds and only need a few essential belongings, we can help.</p>\n<p>Now, the details:</p>\n<p>If you live on Grounds: With your permission, we can arrange for a staff person to go to your room, retrieve essential items you need, and ship them to you. You also are welcome to have a friend do this. To make arrangements for either, please contact housing@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>If you live off Grounds: We have enlisted the help of primary landlords in the area. If you need items from your home or apartment, please call your landlord for help with this or other critical matters. We also hope those of you residing in fraternity and sorority houses will return home. We have been in contact with alumni house corporation officers to seek their (and your) cooperation. If you have friends still in town, please consider asking for their help in collecting your belongings before they leave.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, some leases require that you let your landlord know, in writing, if you will be gone for a week or more. Please check your lease and make sure you follow these and other instructions. If you don't have a copy of your lease, ask your landlord to email it to you.</p>\n<p>It is very important that you return home and be ready to start virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We know some of you will need to stay due to unavoidable circumstances, but otherwise, you should be returning home right away. If you need to return to collect your belongings from your apartment or residence hall, please make every effort to make your trip as brief as possible. We are facing a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. You are risking not only your own health if you continue to gather in groups and circulate in the area, but also – of critical importance – you are risking the health of others in our community who are likely to be more affected by this disease.</p>\n<p>International students and those living a great distance from Grounds: If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.</p>\n<p>Student Workers: Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work. This flexibility applies to students who started classes this spring and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place. The employment of other student workers is under discussion by University leadership, but nothing has been determined at this point.</p>\n<p>Financial concerns: The University is committed to assisting students in need during this unprecedented time. If you are currently receiving financial aid and have questions about resources for leaving Grounds and returning home, please contact UVA Student Financial Services through a special website for Emergency Travel Assistance.</p>\n<p>Online resources: We recognize what an abrupt and challenging transition it will be to shift to virtual classes. Faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and you will have support from the University. You will be able to link to resources through the coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all the steps you are taking to help us respond to this health crisis. This is an unprecedented situation in our lifetimes, and I respectfully ask each of you to do the responsible thing as citizens in a larger community. Your willingness to comply with what is being asked of you will help the broader community – including many at-risk individuals – minimize the impact of this crisis as much as possible. Unlike some crises we witness from afar, this is one where we can each take action that has a tangible result. Individual actions will make a huge difference in how we face and eventually spring back from this difficult challenge. In this case, a selfless decision on your part may save a life.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Allen W. Groves</p>\n<p>University Dean of Students</p>\n<p>March 13: Message Urges Parents to Help Ensure Students Return Home</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered on March 13 to UVA parents and guardians of students:</p>\n<p>Dear Parents and Guardians:</p>\n<p>I am writing to you as someone who cares deeply about your students' safety, health, and well-being. We are facing a public health crisis worldwide, nationwide, and here in Virginia.</p>\n<p>On behalf of the University and larger Charlottesville community, I am appealing to you if your student has told you they want to remain here: We need your help ensuring your student returns home and is ready to begin virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We recognize a small number of students cannot leave due to unavoidable circumstances, and we will continue to support those students, but we need all other students to return home for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>We are especially concerned right now about students living off Grounds. Last night, a number of students were celebrating on the Corner, and a rumor is circulating about more gatherings this evening. We need your assistance in helping them understand the dangers posed by COVID-19. While they may not become sick or may suffer only mild symptoms, they could potentially infect residents in the local community who could contract the disease and become acutely ill.</p>\n<p>We made the very difficult decision to move our classes to virtual instruction not only based on the health and welfare of our students, but also because we want to ensure that the UVA Health System, a Level 1 trauma center, is not stretched too thin in the coming weeks and months. We believe the fewer students in Charlottesville right now, the better for our health system and, thus, for the health and welfare of everyone in the region.</p>\n<p>Mitigating this crisis must be a community-wide effort, and we have enlisted the help of the area's primary landlords, asking them to reiterate these concerns to their student-tenants. Yesterday, we engaged alumni who manage Greek housing, asking their help as well. If your student lives off Grounds and needs individual help with matters like retrieving their most important belongings, they should contact their landlord directly. If your student encounters difficulty after contacting their landlord, please have them email the Office of the Dean of Students at odos@virginia.edu for assistance.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if your student lives on Grounds and they need a few essential things from their room, they can have a friend pick up the items or arrange for a staff member to enter their room to get the items and ship them. For help with this – only if your student lives in on-Grounds housing – please email housing@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>Your student will be hearing more from the University soon about the transition to virtual classes. We know this will be an abrupt and challenging transition, but faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and your student will have support from the University. In addition, Allen Groves, University Dean of Students, will be communicating soon with your student to further clarify a variety of questions that have arisen.</p>\n<p>Thank you to each of you for your help and support. I know there are many whose student is already at home or planning to be at home soon. We are grateful for your partnership and quick action.</p>\n<p>In my 40 years at the University, I have faced many crises, yet none like this. Most of our students have no memory of September 11. This, however, is a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. We must help them understand how vital it is to unite around this crisis. The COVID-19 health crisis is forcing each of us to make sacrifices and changes none of us wants to make. In the end, however, it is not about us. It’s about our responsibility to our fellow human beings. Thank you for all you and your student are doing during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Finally, please continue to check our coronavirus website, which is being updated continually with new information. If you have questions, please call our Response Lines at 877-685-4836: domestic; 1-202-800-2408: international; or email covidinformation@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>March 12: More details about COVID-19 changes</p>\n<p>Dear members of the UVA Community:</p>\n<p>I write to provide a few updates following President Ryan’s email from yesterday about the steps the University is taking in response to the COVID-19 threat. If you have not yet done so, I encourage you to read his message closely.</p>\n<p>To review, President Ryan announced a series of actions yesterday—gearing up to deliver classes on-line as of March 19th, strongly encouraging students to return home if they can, and prohibiting certain events on Grounds. These actions are all guided by the the desire (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. We can advance all of those goals by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds.</p>\n<p>Today we are providing additional updates and announcing several additional changes, some of which are relevant to the entire community, and some of which are specific to faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>First, the more general updates:</p>\n<p>We will be making a decision about Final Exercises by April 15th.</p>\n<p>We know this is top of mind for many of you, especially graduating students, and we are working as fast as we can to give you some clarity – understanding that we don’t yet know what the situation will look like in May.</p>\n<p>Events at John Paul Jones Arena are postponed at least through the weekend.</p>\n<p>Please visit www.johnpauljonesarena.com for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster.</p>\n<p>for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster. We will continue to work with performers and others involved in events scheduled to take place at John Paul Jones arena to evaluate additional upcoming events.</p>\n<p>The ACC has suspended the Spring Athletics season.</p>\n<p>Earlier today, the ACC announced that they have suspended all athletic related activities. This means that all Spring sports at UVA are canceled.</p>\n<p>Fans who have already purchased tickets may contact the Virginia Athletics Ticket Office by phone at 800-542-8821 or by email at uvatickets@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>We are looking into offseting dining and housing costs for students.</p>\n<p>We have set up a Financial Resource Working Group that is looking into, among other things, offsetting dining and housing costs for students. More details will follow soon.</p>\n<p>We also have a Student Life and Leadership fund, which is a rainy day fund distributed by the Student Affairs Office for students with unexpected expenses.</p>\n<p>Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work.</p>\n<p>This flexibility applies to students who started classes for the Spring 2020 term and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place.</p>\n<p>If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.</p>\n<p>Early this morning, the University suspended all of its current study-abroad programs, and encouraged all UVA students to return to the United States by this weekend. The International Studies Office contacted participants in these programs individually.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Below are more specific updates for faculty, staff, and graduate students working on Grounds.</p>\n<p>Let me start by acknowledging how difficult this situation is for all members of our University community and express the leadership’s deep gratitude for your hard work and your dedication to UVA’s missions.</p>\n<p>The University is open and operating.</p>\n<p>Given normal operations, faculty and staff should continue to report to work as usual (you can find more detail on our human resources policies below).</p>\n<p>We will begin scaling back some services, like dining and bus service, but will still meet the needs of employees and the limited number of students who will be remaining on Grounds. Any changes in these services will be posted on the Operations Status Board , and details will be available on departmental websites.</p>\n<p>, and details will be available on departmental websites. Libraries will remain open from 8am to 5pm daily, with the possible exception of weekends. Some locations that depend heavily on student workers may close.</p>\n<p>We are monitoring this rapidly evolving situation closely. A cross-university team, including medical professionals, meets daily. If any modification to the University’s operating schedule becomes necessary, we will let you know immediately.</p>\n<p>Human Resources: All faculty and staff should continue reporting to work, but employees will be eligible for a new leave benefit.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. However, when possible, we do encourage managers to consider options for staff and faculty to work from home. You can find answers to questions about working remotely here .</p>\n<p>. If you have an underlying health condition that necessitates working from home, please talk to your manager, department chair, or dean. They, in turn, are encouraged to be flexible if an employee has a compromised health situation or is caring for someone who does.</p>\n<p>As of today, all employees, including wage and temporary employees, are eligible for up to two weeks of leave if they have been impacted by the virus. This includes employees in both the Academic Division and Medical Center.</p>\n<p>This leave is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member who diagnosed with the disease. More details on this new policy can be found here or you can contact the or contact the HR Solution Center at AskHR@virginia.edu or 434-243-3344.</p>\n<p>Teaching continuity: We are working to support faculty as classes move online.</p>\n<p>We have an all-hands-on-deck approach to bringing our teaching on line. Below are updates on some of the key developments from the cross-university team that is working on this.</p>\n<p>We sent out a survey to faculty and instructors yesterday to determine the support needed to move classes online and we have a plan in place to provide support – either centrally or through schools. If you received the survey and have not responded, please respond immediately. The responses to the survey will be critical to understanding the needs and responding to them.</p>\n<p>You can find general information on teaching continuity here . More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found here .</p>\n<p>. More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found . We are working to identify and support any students who might have connectivity or other assistance needs in accessing online instruction. As a reminder, while online classes will begin on March 19th, there will be no in-person classes between now and March 19th. That is, we are taking a pause in classes. Given that this is only 3 days (similar to snow days in the past), we are confident that we will complete the term with the teaching days available.</p>\n<p>Research continuity: We have plans in place to ensure research can continue.</p>\n<p>Faculty, staff, and postdocs engaged in research are permitted to continue that research. Principle Investigators can designate some of their laboratory staff and postdocs as essential to the continuity of their research.</p>\n<p>Graduate students whose research takes place in the University’s labs will continue to have access to those facilities in consultation with their faculty advisors. Graduate students with appointments as research assistants should be in touch with their faculty advisors to learn about any changes to the activities of their research group.</p>\n<p>We do not know how disruptive this virus will be and encourage anyone conducting research to begin planning for what to do if that research gets disrupted. We have created a research continuity website with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan.</p>\n<p>with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan. All PIs with an active open research grant have been reached individually. There will be additional guidance for social and behavioral sciences, as well as for patient care-based clinical trials, shortly.</p>\n<p>We are suspending all international and non-essential domestic University travel, effective immediately and continuing at least through April 15th.</p>\n<p>International Travel for University business</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, we are prohibiting all University-related international travel by faculty and staff. If you require an exception, please submit a request to the Provost’s office at COVIDTravel@virginia.edu. Requests will require an endorsement of the employee’s dean, vice president, vice provost, or manager.</p>\n<p>Domestic Travel for University business</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, we are suspending all non-essential domestic travel. Essential travel is defined as supporting activities that are absolutely necessary, cannot be rescheduled, and must be done in person. If a supervisor, associate dean, or dean deems the travel essential, it will be reimbursed. If not, it will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Return from international travel</p>\n<p>If you do travel internationally, it is important to note that return may be difficult. As a result of the U.S. Presidential Proclamation on March 11 th , University faculty and staff who have been in Europe’s Schengen area (26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted travel between them) in the previous 14 days before re-entry to the United States will face enhanced screening procedures for returning to the U.S. Please consult the Center for Disease Control for details.</p>\n<p>, University faculty and staff who have been in Europe’s (26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted travel between them) in the previous 14 days before re-entry to the United States will face enhanced screening procedures for returning to the U.S. Please consult the for details.

We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.</p>\n<p>Deans, vice presidents, vice provosts, or unit heads (or their designees) will apply these rules. Any leader with questions about a specific event should direct those questions to the Office of Major Events at uvaome@virginia.edu.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I want to thank all of you again for your patience and understanding.

We will not be holding classes on Grounds for the foreseeable future, quite possibly through the end of the semester. We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date.</p>\n<p>We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date. Online classes will begin Thursday, March 19.</p>\n<p>Students who are away on Spring Break are strongly encouraged to return home or to remain home if they are already there.</p>\n<p>Students on Grounds and in Charlottesville are strongly encouraged to return home by this weekend .</p>\n<p>. University events with more than 100 people are prohibited for the foreseeable future and should be postponed, cancelled, or offered virtually.</p>\n<p>These are obviously significant steps that will cause disruption and disappointment, which we all regret. We nonetheless feel compelled to take these steps in light of the most recent evidence. The virus continues to spread nationally and in Virginia. We still do not yet have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, so our risk remains relatively low. Given that fact, the easiest and least disruptive option would have been to bring all students back to Grounds as planned and hope to make it through the rest of the semester without a confirmed case. We also considered bringing students back and moving only large classes online.</p>\n<p>After talking more with medical experts, however, and as the evidence of the spread here and abroad mounts, we believe that these approaches would not be sufficient and would create too much risk, especially for our health system and the medical center, which is a Level 1 trauma center and may be stretched to the limits in the coming weeks and months. Experts have also told us that the best time to take steps to prevent that spread is now, before the first case arrives.</p>\n<p>Our approach here is guided by three goals: (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. All of those goals are advanced by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds. We cannot eliminate all risks, of course, but we believe at this time these steps will help mitigate the risks we face.</p>\n<p>To be clear, the University – including university buildings and UVA Health – will remain open, and we will bring students back to Grounds as soon as we can do so safely. While we hope to do so before the end of the semester, we may not be able to and are working on a number of contingency plans, including plans for graduation.</p>\n<p>A few notes for specific groups:</p>\n<p>Students</p>\n<p>If you are currently away on Spring Break, we strongly encourage you to stay home or return to your home . Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>. Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming. If you are currently in Charlottesville, we strongly encourage you to return home .</p>\n<p>This strong request applies to all students regardless of where you are living – whether on Grounds or off.</p>\n<p>whether on Grounds or off. We recognize that some students cannot go home, for a variety of reasons, ranging from the fact that their hometowns or countries are not safe to the fact that their only homes are in Charlottesville. We will continue to provide housing for students living on Grounds who genuinely cannot return home, and we will continue to provide dining services, though they will be modified. We will also offer assistance to students on financial aid who need help in returning to their homes.</p>\n<p>With the help and creativity of faculty and staff, we will make sure you are able to meet your academic requirements remotely, and we will pay special attention to graduating students. You will be hearing from deans and professors over the next week with details about your classes, including any clinical, experiential, performance-based, or studio learning that may require alternative arrangements.</p>\n<p>Faculty</p>\n<p>All faculty will be hearing from their deans soon with more details about moving classes online.</p>\n<p>We are standing up a team to provide the necessary training and technology to move courses online.</p>\n<p>While some research will be put on hold, we have plans in place to allow core research operations to continue. Those of you who are conducting research will be hearing from our Provost, Liz Magill, and our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian, with more details soon.</p>\n<p>Staff</p>\n<p>For the time being, staff should continue reporting to work as usual and take the recommended steps to prevent illness. A full list can be found here .</p>\n<p>. Staff with questions or concerns about their workplaces and the possibility of telecommuting should speak with their supervisors. We ask that staff who are feeling sick to please remain at home.</p>\n<p>Events</p>\n<p>Effective immediately and until further notice, we are suspending all university-sponsored events that involve more than 100 people.</p>\n<p>For events that involve fewer than 100 people, we strongly recommend alternatives to having an in-person event and, if that is not possible, taking all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of infection. We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.</p>\n<p>At this time, these restrictions do not apply to athletic events or events at JPJ, both of which remain under discussion and consideration.</p>\n<p>We realize you will likely have questions, both about this decision and about COVID-19 in general. Starting today, you can go to this website for more information, and we have set up a call center (Domestic: 877-685-4836; International: +1 202-800-2408) with staff trained to answer the most common questions. We will also be sending out more detailed communications about various elements of this plan, which we will also post on the website. As this is an evolving situation, we will also provide updates if there are significant changes to the plan outlined in this email.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank the teams from across the University who have been working incredibly hard over the last few weeks, and who will keep working hard to make this transition as smooth as possible. I am deeply grateful that UVA is home to so many expert, capable people who are dedicated to the well-being of our community and to our critical missions of teaching, research, and clinical care.</p>\n<p>I would also like to thank all of you for your patience and understanding. Put simply, UVA has never encountered something quite like this. There is no roadmap for trying to put most of the University curriculum online in a week. But I have enormous faith in this community – in your resilience, your willingness to do your part to keep others safe, and your ability to make the most of a very difficult situation.</p>\n<p>I have special faith in our students, for whom the health risks are generally low and for whom the disappointments are high, but who I know will recognize that now is the time to think first of the well-being of others.</p>\n<p>We are in this together, though I recognize that the impact will be uneven. As the father of a graduating senior at another university who has been asked to return home, I know this decision will hit our fourth-year students especially hard. It will also create economic challenges and hardships for some in the Charlottesville community whose livelihoods depend on our students. We will make it through this together by supporting each other, thinking creatively, and staying connected even if physically separated. I cannot pretend, obviously, that this is how I hoped this semester would unfold. No one can. But I eagerly await the ingenuity, compassion, and kindness that this common challenge will surely unlock within our community. If there were ever a time to be both great and good, this is surely it.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Jim</p>\n<hr>\n<p>James E. Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>March 8: Coronavirus Updates on University Preparedness, Travel, and Operations</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University community on March 8.</p>\n<p>Dear members of the University community:</p>\n<p>Like all of you, I am concerned about the presence of the novel coronavirus in the United States and abroad and its potential effect on students, families, employees, and community members. I write today to share the latest information we have and some decisions we have made to look out for the wellbeing of our University community and the greater Charlottesville region.</p>\n<p>There has not been a case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, but the Virginia Department of Health has confirmed two cases of COVID-19 in the Commonwealth, both in Northern Virginia. Our immediate risk remains low. The situation, however, is rapidly evolving, much remains unknown about the threats posed by COVID-19, and we take very seriously the responsibility to make prudent choices for the wellbeing of our community. A cross-university team continues to meet regularly to share information in real-time, consider changes in approach that will best protect our community, and set plans in motion for a wide variety of contingencies. I am in contact with them daily, and Provost Magill and I will continue to regularly update the community, through messages and on our website, about what we know and our plans.</p>\n<p>Consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Department of State, and the Virginia Department of Health, we have decided to enact the following restrictions and guidelines on University-related travel in order to help to mitigate our community’s risk of exposure to the virus:</p>\n<p>International Travel</p>\n<p>University-related travel to countries where the CDC has enacted level 3, or the State Department has enacted levels 3 or 4 is prohibited.CDC travel guidance related to COVID-19 is available here.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff who have exceptional reasons to travel to those countries may submit a petition to the Provost’s office via an email to COVIDtravel@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>International travel to restricted areas without an approved petition will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>If you travel or have recently traveled to one of these countries, we expect you to follow CDC guidance about self-isolation: stay home for a period of 14 days upon your return and seek medical attention if you experience fever, coughs, or difficulty breathing.</p>\n<p>Domestic Travel</p>\n<p>At this point, we are not prohibiting university-related domestic travel, but we strongly discourage all University travel (both domestic and international) for non-essential purposes, particularly that by air, to large gatherings, and to areas experiencing high numbers of COVID-19 cases, as documented by the CDC. If you must travel, please take all possible precautions before traveling, including staying up to date on the latest spread of the virus and considering difficulties you may encounter in returning home, especially when traveling internationally.</p>\n<p>These guidelines will be effective immediately and will be in place until at least April 15. Before April 15, we will re-assess and determine whether these policies will continue.</p>\n<p>While these guidelines apply to University-related travel, we ask members of the community to apply similar judgment in considering personal travel commitments, both internationally and domestically.</p>\n<p>Spring Break and Beyond</p>\n<p>Many of our students are currently away on Spring Break, so the pace of events on Grounds has slowed for the week ahead. Unless local conditions change, University sponsored events, programs, tours, and operations will continue as planned during Spring Break. We will continue to monitor this issue carefully, relying on guidance from internal experts at UVA Health, the Virginia Department of Health, and the CDC.</p>\n<p>We will write again by the middle of the week with additional updates regarding University programming during the weeks following Spring Break. At this point in time, we plan for students to return to Grounds and to resume classes, but we will be making some modifications to mitigate against the risk of exposure to and transmission of the virus, which we will explain in more detail by mid-week.</p>\n<p>This is a challenging time for our community, the nation, and the world as we respond to COVID-19 and the uncertainty surrounding it. We will do our best to stay on top of this quickly evolving situation, and to communicate with you regularly and fully as conditions change. I am grateful to all of you for your understanding and flexibility, and for your commitment to the wellbeing of our community. This is a time for our community to come together, and acting together, I remain confident in our ability to navigate this difficult and uncertain period.</p>\n<p>For more information, please consult our website, which we are continually updating.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 3: Important Updates Related to Spring Break and Student, Faculty and Staff Travel</p>\n<p>The following message to the University community was delivered March 3.</p>\n<p>Dear members of the UVA community:</p>\n<p>Since our last University-wide communication on February 28, the number of national coronavirus (COVID-19) cases continues to rise. While we are not aware of any cases in Virginia, the safety of the UVA and Charlottesville communities is our primary concern. I write to share with you the proactive steps we are taking. Note that this guidance is subject to change as the situation is rapidly evolving. You can find updates and resources on the University’s website.</p>\n<p>Spring Break Study Abroad</p>\n<p>The University has canceled all outbound study abroad programs scheduled over spring break. We notified affected faculty program directors and students today. Schools will work directly with students to arrange for completion of coursework through alternative means.</p>\n<p>Our decision on spring break trips was guided by the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) March 1st recommendation that Universities should reconsider study abroad travel. It is in everyone’s best interest that students avoid unnecessary travel through crowded transportation hubs for short visits to uncertain environments before they return to Grounds. We feel this is the best decision to protect our students and our local community where students will return after their travel.</p>\n<p>We are in close, regular communication with those students who are currently abroad on exchange and other programs, regarding how to monitor and assess their current situations based on conditions in the country they are visiting.</p>\n<p>Travel Guidance</p>\n<p>The CDC maintains a Travel Information website related to COVID-19, and specifically recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to countries at Warning Level 3. Note that these ratings can change rapidly.</p>\n<p>We urge faculty, staff, and students who have personal or professional plans to travel either internationally or to affected areas in the U.S. to reconsider their travel. In doing so, we ask each of you to take into account the possibility of travel delays, future quarantines, or prolonged self-isolation when returning from travel to the UVA and Charlottesville communities.</p>\n<p>If you have travel insurance, you should closely review your plan to assure it does not exclude pandemics in the case of need for medical evacuation.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage faculty and staff to share any travel plans with your department chair, dean, or manager in order to facilitate University assistance if the need arises.</p>\n<p>We strongly urge student organizations (CIOs) to share any travel plans with the Office of the Dean of Students.</p>\n<p>The decisions we are making rely heavily on the guidance we are receiving from the CDC and the Virginia Department of Health and are intended to protect the health and welfare of our faculty, staff, students, and local community. We recognize the uncertainty this global health issue is creating and are committed to keep you informed and up to date as this situation evolves. You may find updates and current information on the University’s website and FAQ.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>Feb. 28: Message of Solidarity from Provost Magill</p>\n<p>The following message to Chinese faculty, students, staff and scholars was delivered Feb. 28.</p>\n<p>Dear colleagues:</p>\n<p>Today I’m writing to you – our esteemed faculty, staff, and scholars from China – to express the University’s concern and support for you as the coronavirus continues to spread in China and beyond. We understand how worried you must be about your family and friends who are contending with the virus and its effects. As an expression of our support, we made this video, and we have shared it widely with members of our UVA family who are in China.</p>\n<p>UVA officials are carefully monitoring the spread of the virus and listening closely to advice and directives coming from the CDC, the Virginia Department of Health, and the federal government. We are offering online resources via the coronavirus website and through the coronavirus FAQs, which we are updating frequently. If you have questions or concerns that are not addressed in these materials, please call our faculty and staff coronavirus phone line at 434-297-4027.</p>\n<p>We have heard that some of you feel an obligation to offer support to students from China who are here at UVA. We are grateful for your willingness to comfort and advise our students in this way; at the same time, we realize that this responsibility may feel overwhelming. In addition to using the resources above, students can reach counselors at CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) at 434-243-5150, 24 hours a day. The International Studies Office (ISO) is also available to assist students who are studying here from abroad, and we have support resources available for faculty and staff through the Faculty &#x26; Employee Assistance Program.</p>\n<p>As we continue to contend with the coronavirus, please know that we are thinking of you and your families, friends, and colleagues, and we are committed to providing the support you need during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Warmly,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>Feb. 26: Update on Coronavirus for UVA Students</p>\n<p>The following message to University students was delivered Feb. 26:</p>\n<p>Important Reminders: Spring Break Health and Safety</p>\n<p>To: All Students</p>\n<p>From: Allen W. Groves, University Dean of Students</p>\n<p>odos@virginia.edu</p>\n<p>Dear Students:</p>\n<p>Since many of you soon will be leaving Charlottesville for Spring Break, I am writing with several important reminders about health and safety.</p>\n<p>If you follow the news, you already know the global coronavirus outbreak is a major concern for anyone considering international travel at this time. The virus has spread to areas of the world beyond China with an accelerating and unpredictable trajectory. This threat will likely grow. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced this week that the virus is expected to impact the United States in a more severe way than it has to date.</p>\n<p>Traveling abroad – whether for study or leisure – carries a number of potential risks. Even a country not currently experiencing an outbreak could suddenly be declared a high-risk area, resulting in heightened exposure to the virus, difficulty with departure, immigration barriers in returning to the U.S., and even possible restrictions on returning to Grounds. The University strongly recommends not traveling to locations with CDC or State Department Level 3 alerts or higher. While we have not cancelled any current or existing study abroad programs, the University will cancel any such programs, even if already under way, at any location for which the CDC sets a warning level 3, or the State Department sets a warning level 3 or 4.</p>\n<p>The seasonal flu also is present in many areas. Basic measures remain the best defense against coronavirus, flu, and other communicable diseases:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with soapy water.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Cough and sneeze into a tissue or your elbow.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>TRAVEL PREPARATION</p>\n<p>The CDC maintains a travel information website for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>\n<p>for coronavirus (COVID-19).

As we experience a global pandemic that is expected to worsen in coming days in our area of the country, the University is joining with entities at the local, regional and state level to share resources that may be needed for the health and well-being of our fellow citizens.</p>\n<p>You and your student already are making personal sacrifices that none of us fully envisioned even a month ago. I’m writing today to thank you for all you are doing and to share more information about plans that will have an impact on a small contingent of students and their families. Although this does not affect all of you, I believe it’s important for all of our students and families to understand what – and why – certain decisions have been made in recent days.</p>\n<p>As a state institution with a public trust and mission, we have a duty to share our resources in times of crisis. Our facilities are owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia. It’s our good fortune that the UVA Hospital, a nationally renowned, level one trauma center, is part of our extended Grounds. We offer major resources that can help those suffering from COVID-19 and other illnesses, as well as assist the many doctors, nurses and staff members who are caring for them. Our resources are part of the bigger picture that emergency planners are reviewing to determine a comprehensive, joint response to aid the Central Virginia area.</p>\n<p>At the same time these plans are evolving, we must adhere to medical guidance and concerns for the safety and health of you, your families, our staff members and people in Charlottesville. Many of you have understandably wanted to return to the Grounds to pick up your students’ belongings if they lived in a residence hall. That simply is not possible given all the current concerns about the spread of COVID-19. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, but only when consistent with public health and safety.</p>\n<p>The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds. We are in contact with the some 250 undergraduate students who remain so they are aware of how to access services if they need help.</p>\n<p>Emergency Use of Bond, Bice, Shea, French and Spanish Houses. As part of the overall efforts addressing the COVID-19 crisis, the University recently was asked to provide housing in residence halls near the hospital. The buildings include Bice, Bond, Shea, and the French and Spanish houses. This weekend, eight students who had remained in those five buildings were relocated to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley, located on the opposite side of Grounds.</p>\n<p>As part of this process to answer the call of projected emergency needs, we now must carefully pack up and store all the possessions of students who had lived in those five buildings. The residents of those buildings received an email with details on Sunday and are being asked to complete a questionnaire to help direct the vendor we have retained for packing, moving and storage. A second email further clarifying the process was distributed yesterday. Students who received the questionnaire need to complete it by tomorrow, April 8, so the vendor can handle students’ possessions as carefully as possible and in accordance with their preferences.</p>\n<p>The University is covering the full cost of packing and storing items from these five buildings. Students only need to pay if they want to go to the storage warehouse and pick up their belongings before some point in the future when conditions are safer and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has lifted the stay-home order issued last week. Once a timeframe is set, the vendor will deliver everyone’s packed belongings to a central area of the Grounds where students and parents can pick them up. A range of dates and times for pick-up will be available.</p>\n<p>Governor Northam’s Executive Order. If you live in Virginia, then you know Gov. Northam issued an Executive Order last week directing Virginians to stay at home until June 10. This order, and previous guidance from the governor and other officials, has guided our decisions since mid-March about students returning to Grounds.</p>\n<p>The majority of our students are no longer in Charlottesville. A significant number, however, remain in off-Grounds apartments or houses. By and large, they are following social distancing guidelines and not gathering in groups larger than 10. I have seen exceptions, however, most notably on the UVA Lawn. Enjoying the beautiful spring weather is certainly not a problem, but if you think your student needs a reminder about not gathering in groups larger than 10, please help us out. It’s for their own safety and that of others. The asymptomatic spread of the novel coronavirus poses major concerns.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal Deadline Extended. For students only in the College of Arts &#x26; Sciences, the date to withdraw from the spring term has been changed to May 8 (it had previously been April 14). All College students now have until May 8 to withdraw from the spring 2020 term and return in fall 2020 (or summer). Students in the College have received a notification about this.</p>\n<p>Message from Dean Groves. All students received a message yesterday from University Dean of Students Allen Groves. He reminded students of the importance of social distancing and covered several other important topics, including the possibility of unemployment benefits for students who had part-time jobs and are now having difficulty paying rent or other major expenses. He also listed the many services available remotely, including the services of Student Health and Counseling &#x26; Psychological Services. I encourage you to read his message and ensure your student reads it.</p>\n<p>The University is committed to sharing updates with you as information is available, but we remain in a fluid situation marked by numerous uncertainties. Thank you for all you are doing to support your student as they finish this semester remotely. I hope you and your families are weathering this crisis as well as possible.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>April 6: Ryan Announces Emergency Fund to Assist Contract Workers, UVA Employees</p>\n<p>The following email was distributed to members of the University community on Monday:</p>\n<p>To the University community:</p>\n<p>I am writing to let you know about efforts we are making to support workers furloughed by our contractors and about a contribution to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation.</p>\n<p>A core aspiration of our strategic plan is to be a university that is both great and good. Toward that end, we have committed to doing our best to be a good neighbor and to live our values. That means, among other things, doing what we can to support our most vulnerable community members.</p>\n<p>We have kept our employees on our payroll, and we will continue to do so for as long as we can. Some of our contractors, including Aramark, have furloughed their employees. More may do so in the future. These workers are entitled to state and federal unemployment benefits, as well as some benefits being offered directly by their employers.</p>\n<p>It has become clear that these benefits are not flowing as quickly as any of us would like, and that our contract workers need immediate assistance. It is also clear that there may be a gap between the relief available from unemployment benefits and meeting the necessities of life. Our own employees may also be facing unexpected costs due to the crisis we are all facing.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we are devoting $2 million to create an emergency assistance fund for UVA contract workers and employees. We cannot provide a salary or wages to those who have been furloughed, because doing so would make them ineligible for the state and federal benefits that exist for those who are unemployed. But we can provide funding to help meet an array of needs related to the crisis. Our primary focus will be to help those who have been furloughed, but this fund will also be available for those still employed and facing unexpected costs.</p>\n<p>We will also be providing assistance to furloughed contract workers who need help in applying for state and federal unemployment benefits, and we expect this fund to be a helpful bridge to those who are awaiting benefits. We will keep this fund operational until June 1, and we will reassess at that point.</p>\n<p>We will have more details to share by mid-week, including a timeline and process for accessing the funds. A number of you have contacted me about helping out your colleagues, and I’m grateful for your interest and compassion. To facilitate that help, we are setting up a process for employees to donate directly to this fund.</p>\n<p>We are also committed to being a good neighbor to the Charlottesville region. For that reason, we are also contributing $1 million to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation to support their efforts to stabilize households during this pandemic. The Foundation has already raised over $2.3 million to support these efforts, and they are doing great work and deserve our support. For anyone who needs immediate assistance, please call their Community Resource Helpline at 434-234-4490.</p>\n<p>We will have more to say later this week about additional steps we are going to take to support our community, but I did not want to wait to get this information out. We face challenges ahead. We will only get through them by working together and doing what we can to support each other. Thanks for all of your efforts in that regard.</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>April 5: Update from the Dean of Students</p>\n<p>Dear Undergraduate, Graduate and Professional School Students:</p>\n<p>I’m writing today to offer updates on a few subjects, and also to check in on you. As April begins, it’s still somewhat difficult to fully grasp all that has occurred over the past few weeks. I imagine you are feeling a range of emotions. I hope as you deal with this upheaval in your life you will take some time for self-care and reflection. If you are spending major portions of your day in front of a computer instead of in a classroom or research lab or library with the friends, advisors, colleagues, and the routines you had come to enjoy, social isolation can be a real problem. Feelings of distance, loneliness, and even depression can result. Many of us feel a bit of “cabin fever” and that’s quite natural. Things as simple as taking a long walk and enjoying nature can help in dealing with the uncertainty everyone is feeling now.</p>\n<p>I urge you to stay connected with your friends and whoever else lifts your spirits. Prioritize your health, including getting adequate sleep, moving your muscles, and eating nutritiously. If you would like to speak with a counselor at any point, we continue to offer services through CAPS and Student Health remotely. Please see the end of this message for resources and contact information.</p>\n<p>If you are having difficulty with your courses, either because of the material, online delivery, or other issue, please reach out for help. If you are an undergraduate student, please call on your professor, teaching assistant, academic advisor, association dean (if in the College), or perhaps engage with a tutor or peer. Graduate and professional students should reach out to their professor, advisor, research director, department chair, or academic dean.</p>\n<p>• Governor Northam’s Executive Order. The warm spring weather can be a soothing antidote to stress, but it carries a risk as well. It remains very important to practice social distancing and abide by local directives. While it will be tempting to gather outside in groups, it is essential that you follow orders like those issued by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to maintain social distancing and only go out for essential needs. The Governor’s most recent Executive Order directs Virginians to stay at home through June 10. This does not preclude going out for a walk, for example, but if you go with a few friends, you should be mindful of keeping a distance of at least six feet between you. No groups of 10 or more can gather outside or elsewhere in Virginia, on public or private property. Many other states have similar restrictions aimed at “flattening the curve” and avoiding larger scale COVID-19 infections that may overwhelm our health care system.</p>\n<p>• Doing Our Part. We know the COVID-19 crisis is worsening in most of the country, including in Virginia. University leaders are responding by turning significant attention to our health system and standing ready to support the consolidated, joint efforts of emergency teams in the Charlottesville community and larger central Virginia area. As a state institution with a public trust and mission, it is our duty to respond to requests for use of our facilities and resources at the local, regional, state, and national levels.</p>\n<p>• Emergency Use of Residence Halls. Within the past few days, we have responded to requests from emergency planners to make residence hall space available near the UVA Hospital. The 15 undergraduate students who still resided in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses have been relocated this weekend, with help from the teams in Housing &#x26; Residence Life and Facilities Management, to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley. Additionally, students who had been living in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses – but had left Charlottesville previously – have been notified that the University will be carefully packing and storing their belongings at no cost to students, so the buildings can be used to support needs arising from this crisis. (Students can also choose to have their belongings shipped to them at their expense.)</p>\n<p>This crisis bears similarities to war efforts of the past when citizens had to make sacrifices and pull together for the greater good. I regret some decisions have come very quickly with little advance communication, but the situation is exceptionally fluid right now and the University is part of larger efforts with new priorities emerging daily. Whenever possible, we are committed to communicating with you in advance and as fully as possible. We will always endeavor not simply to tell you what action is being taken, but also why.</p>\n<p>• Retrieving Belongings from the Residence Halls. Given medical guidance and concerns for the health of you, your families, and people in Charlottesville, it will not be possible for students who were living in residence halls to come back to the Grounds at this time to retrieve personal possessions from on-Grounds residences. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, and only when consistent with public health and safety. The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds.</p>\n<p>• Support for International Students. Of special note is that many of the undergraduate and graduate students remaining on Grounds and in our Charlottesville community are international students. We recognize the special challenges they face being far from home. We communicated last week with all students remaining on Grounds and emphasized how they can access needed services. For our international students in particular, we want to underscore our condemnation of, and resolve to combat, any acts of bias or xenophobia against them. If you have been the target of such an act, please report it through the University’s Just Report It system. Of course, if you believe you are ever in immediate danger, you should always call 911.</p>\n<p>• Financial Hardships. Without question, the coronavirus crisis is taking an economic toll on many, including our students, faculty and staff, and their families. The University is examining how costs and losses are affecting our operations. This includes the recognition that some families who have been hit especially hard may need to update their financial information with Student Financial Services for purposes of calculating institutional aid and access to other resources.</p>\n<p>Many students have expressed considerable concern about losing their wages from part-time jobs, affecting their ability to pay rent and other major expenses. Please note, the Student Legal Services office, which is staffed by attorney Lester Wilson and funded by the Student Activity Fee, may be a resource to assist you. More information is available on the Student Legal Services website.</p>\n<p>New federal legislation may also grant part-time student workers eligibility for unemployment benefits through the Virginia Employment Commission. Students who had part-time jobs, but are currently unemployed, can apply now on the VEC website. Applicants will need to renew their claims weekly, preferably Mondays through Wednesdays. The VEC website states VEC is still awaiting guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, so the timing of funding is uncertain. If you are a part-time student worker who lost your job in another state, you should apply using that state’s website to seek unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p>We are grateful to our graduate students for the support they continue to provide to the University’s core missions of teaching and research. For those students who are serving as Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs), the University’s policy on continuity of pay is noted on the Human Resources website. During the spring term, GTAs continue in their roles of working with faculty in teaching remotely for the remainder of the semester, while GRAs and research fellows continue to work with their faculty advisors and supervisors to engage in the activities of their research groups, including continuing research remotely to the extent possible. We know how disruptive this pandemic has been to the academic careers of our graduate students. The Provost and the Vice President for Research continue to work with the deans and faculty to find ways to ensure the success of our graduate students during this time of disruption in their education and research.</p>\n<p>Emergency funding continues to be available for all students in need. As a reminder, three forms of funding are available:</p>\n<p>• Final Exercises. Having walked the Lawn myself as a graduating student, I fully recognize the importance of walking the Lawn for our graduating students and their families. Last month, President Ryan asked Pam Higgins, Executive Director for Major Events in the President’s Office, and me to lead a working group of undergraduate and graduate students and representatives from the schools to recommend ways for a meaningful celebration still to occur on the Lawn. We hope to present recommendations soon to President Ryan and his senior leadership team. You should expect to hear directly from President Ryan on this topic in the coming weeks, as he is committed to seeing this through for you.</p>\n<p>• Providing Support. Many of you have expressed interest in supporting the University Health System and our local community, and we have seen many gestures of generosity. If you would like to learn more about how you can support the care needs of the Health System, please visit their website.</p>\n<p>With six weeks remaining in the semester, I hope to communicate several more times before everyone finishes the term. I personally want to stay connected with you, and I feel it is important for you to receive regular updates about important student topics and how the University is responding to the coronavirus crisis.</p>\n<p>I wish the best to each of you and your families.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Allen W.

But I realize many of you may be wondering about Governor Northam’s Executive Order, which was released this afternoon. So before I get to the summer programs, let me say a few words about the Governor’s Executive Order.</p>\n<p>The order requires all Virginia residents to remain at home, unless they are traveling to and from work or seeking essential services like medical care, food, or banking. Institutions of higher education, like UVA, “shall cease all in-person classes and instruction, and cancel all gatherings of more than ten individuals. For purposes of facilitating remote learning, performing critical research, or performing essential functions, institutions of higher education may continue to operate, provided that social distancing requirements are maintained.”</p>\n<p>This order is consistent with the decisions we have made over the last few weeks and will not change the way we are currently operating. If more changes become necessary, we will let you know.</p>\n<p>As far as this summer is concerned, in keeping with our decisions about this semester, we have decided to cancel all in-person summer programs through June 30th, 2020. “Summer programs” include classes, conferences, camps, and other events that are scheduled to occur on Grounds through June 30th.</p>\n<p>This means that classes offered during Summer Session 1 and 2 will move online. You can find more information about Summer Session at <a href=\"https://summer.virginia.edu/\">https://summer.virginia.edu/</a>. By June 1st, we will make a decision about in-person summer programs occurring after July 1st.</p>\n<p>As always, please visit <a href=\"https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus</a> for the most up-to-date information on our response to COVID-19 and answers to frequently asked questions. I hope that you and yours are safe and healthy.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>March 23: Provost Clarifies the State of Research and Warns of Potential Shutdown</p>\n<p>Dear UVA Faculty and those involved in the research enterprise:</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience as we work together to tackle this fast-moving and complex public health crisis. We understand this has been a difficult period, including for those engaged in the important task of research, whether they do their work in a lab or in an office or in the field. As you know, last week, the University announced extraordinary measures to “flatten the curve” even as we work to continue our missions of teaching, research, and clinical care. The following day, the University announced that these measures apply to the research enterprise.</p>\n<p>This message follows up on this March 20 communication from our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian. I write to: i) provide two reminders; ii) to clarify the University’s approach to the engagement of graduate students in research during this period; and iii) to emphasize that all engaged in the research enterprise should be preparing for the possibility of a shutdown of ongoing research and resorting only to the maintenance of key laboratory assets.</p>\n<p>First, two reminders:</p>\n<p>I want to reaffirm the University position on research: As announced last week, the research enterprise should be shifting to key functions only – and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked here . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school.</p>\n<p>– and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school. In keeping with the University-wide approach to “flattening the curve”: All employees, including those engaged in the research enterprise, who can work from home, must work from home and their supervisor (here, PI) must require that they do so. Like all managers, a PI can “designate” a category of employees who must report in person to perform key functions. In keeping with efforts to “flatten the curve,” this category must be as small as possible to perform those tasks and the PI must assure that the safest practices are followed.</p>\n<p>Second, regarding the role of graduate students in the days ahead:</p>\n<p>As a matter of principle, the University position is that graduate students are – first and foremost – students . We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future.</p>\n<p>. We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future. Given their status as students, the rule is this: a faculty member is not permitted to “designate” a graduate student, which would mean that the graduate student must report in person to perform key tasks. This rule is subject to narrow exceptions (decided through a process described below) if the PI/Research Leader and graduate student jointly request an exception.</p>\n<p>Exceptions : I will, after consulting with others (the relevant school dean, the VPR, and the EVPHA) determine whether an exception to this rule will be granted. Petitions to permit a graduate student to continue in-person work should be submitted by the PI and as the form indicates with the consent of the graduate student to the Provost’s Office by using this form.</p>\n<p>Third, it is critical that all PIs/Research Leaders plan for a shutdown of ongoing research. We do not know if or when that might occur; as has happened in some other states, it is possible that the decision will be required by a government order over which we have little control. Given this, it is crucial that researchers have a plan to preserve the vital material that is essential for research (for example, animals, cells, continuously run instruments and machines, special materials, and reagents). This task of preservation and planning will assure that, if we must pause our ongoing research, we will be positioned to return to this important endeavor whenever the pause is over. Believe me, all of us wish we could predict if and when we might have to shut down ongoing research; but we do not yet know. I assure you that we will continue to keep the UVA research community up to date in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and generosity of spirit during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 19: New Cases of COVID-19 Includes UVA Student</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University community on March 19:</p>\n<p>Dear University community:</p>\n<p>Earlier today the Virginia Department of Health confirmed three new cases of COVID-19 in the Charlottesville area.</p>\n<p>One of those cases is a UVA student who lives off Grounds in Albemarle County. The student, who is believed to have contracted the virus during recent international travel, is in isolation and receiving care following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish this student a speedy recovery during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort, with the assistance of University officials, to identify people who were in contact with this individual, reaching out to those individuals and arranging for their self-isolation, if necessary.</p>\n<p>The health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority. We realize a case of COVID-19 within our student body creates a heightened sense of anxiety and concern. The University coronavirus page offers a number of resources to help community members stay healthy and to cope with the strain this period is placing on all of us.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, as we work together to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>Additional information is available from the CDC.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, please respond to this email at covidinformation@virginia.edu or call 877-685-4836 (domestic) or 1-202-800-2408 (international).</p>\n<p>We have posted notification of this recent case on the UVA Coronavirus website. As a result of the expected spread of the coronavirus and the development of additional testing capacity, there will likely be additional cases in the coming days. We will not be emailing about each of them, but our default will be to post notifications of new cases to the coronavirus website and to email about new cases sparingly.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for your continued support and compassion during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Christopher P. Holstege, M.D.</p>\n<p>Department of Student Health &#x26; Wellness</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>March 18: Provost Outlines Undergraduate Grading Policy for Online Courses</p>\n<p>Dear UVA faculty, students, and staff:</p>\n<p>We are facing extraordinary challenges as a result of COVID-19. As the letter President Ryan and I shared yesterday made clear, this has required rapid and consequential decision making. In seeking to fulfill our academic mission, our guiding principles are clear: We will work to protect our University community and our neighbors, and we will do all we can to continue educating our students and pursuing our research. The effort to sustain our educational mission has required enormous effort and creativity by thousands of faculty and staff. As we launch tomorrow into our rapid transition from in-person to online instruction for the remainder of this semester, I am writing to provide direction on how we will handle grading for undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>For this semester, for our undergraduate schools, credit/no credit (CR/NC) will be the default grading system for all classes where the work is not yet completed; students will also, however, have the option to receive a letter grade. Students must decide whether to receive a letter grade by the last day of spring semester classes, Tuesday, April 28th. We will be in touch about the process for making that choice as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Several other details are important:</p>\n<p>Courses taken for CR/NC during Spring 2020 will count toward curricular, major, and graduation requirements. Such grades are not factored into a student’s GPA. Students who remain in the CR/NC option must complete the class with a grade of C or better to receive credit.</p>\n<p>This policy applies only to undergraduate level courses. The deans of the graduate and professional programs are considering how they will approach this question, and they will soon announce their decisions to their schools.</p>\n<p>UVA will include a designation on students’ transcripts to indicate that the CR/NC option was created in the midst of an extraordinary crisis and as part of the University’s effort to manage the transition to online instruction.</p>\n<p>These are not ordinary times. Every day, I am struck anew by the enormity of the challenges and the enormity of the effort being brought to bear to meet those challenges. As we resume the semester with online courses tomorrow, I want to thank all of you for your ingenuity, understanding, and patience. I remain confident in our collective ability to navigate this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 18: Provost Outlines Guidance for Maintaining Research Continuity</p>\n<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>\n<p>I write to provide an update on our approach to research, as promised in yesterday's University message. In consultation with President Ryan, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Craig Kent, and Vice President for Research Ram Ramasubramanian, the following principles are guiding our efforts on research. Research, like education, is central to the University's mission. Similar to our extraordinary effort to move classes online, we are taking dramatic steps to respond to this public health crisis while continuing our research mission.</p>\n<p>In keeping with, and directly quoting, yesterday’s message: “All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools, or UVA Health.” This directive applies to all University employees. Like managers across Grounds, Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers “have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.”</p>\n<p>We all remain grateful for your patience and partnership as we face these unprecedented times. In addition to the University’s coronavirus website, please visit the Vice President for Research website for specific resources and detailed guidance. Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers can find detailed research continuity guidelines here.</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 17: COVID-19 Causes Sweeping Changes to University Operations</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University Community on March 17:</p>\n<p>To the University community,</p>\n<p>We write with some important updates across a range of issues. As you know, this is an unprecedented and very rapidly changing situation, and all of us are learning more every day. At this point, it seems imperative that we do our very best to slow the progression of this virus in order to “flatten the curve” of those infected and avoid overwhelming our health system, which would ultimately risk our patients, our community, and our Charlottesville neighbors. This requires taking some significant, additional steps at this point.</p>\n<p>We realize and regret that these additional steps will cause more disappointment and call for more sacrifice, but we see no other way to do our part to help confront this public health crisis. We must also be mindful of the need of our students, their families, and our faculty and staff to plan, and we need to be mindful of protecting our faculty and staff, who make this place run. For all of those reasons, today we are announcing the following changes, including adjustments to classes, research, and events; guidance for employees; and modifications to services.</p>\n<p>These changes will go into effect immediately wherever possible, though we recognize that some may take a bit of time to implement fully, as explained more below.</p>\n<p>ADJUSTMENTS TO CLASSES, RESEARCH, AND EVENTS</p>\n<p>Classes will remain online throughout the semester. It is exceedingly unlikely, based on all that we know at this point, that this virus will have abated by the end of April. In light of the need for faculty, staff, and students to make plans, we are making the decision now – rather than waiting until April 5 – to not hold any classes on Grounds this semester. For students who do not have the technology needed to complete their classes online, please visit our technology support fund page and read the instructions and guidelines completely. We are in active discussions about what changes we might make to our normal grading system this semester. We will be back in touch soon, once we have made a decision.</p>\n<p>Final Exercises will not proceed as planned. In light of the evidence about the likely progression of the virus over the next couple of months, and when it will peak, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Final Exercises as currently planned. We did not make this decision lightly, as we know how disappointing it will be to graduating students and their families. That said, a team is already focused on developing creative alternatives to mark this important occasion, and we will communicate updates as we have them.</p>\n<p>All events on Grounds are cancelled, no matter the size, until at least May 15. We had originally cancelled events over 100, but on Sunday the CDC suggested no groups larger than 50, and just recently the White House and the Governor of Virginia suggested gatherings of no more than 10 people. Rather than continue to chase the ever-shrinking size limitations, we want to be clear that all events should be cancelled this semester. These restrictions include events that are not University-sponsored, but are planned to occur on Grounds, including conferences, symposia, and social gatherings. This does not preclude small internal meetings, where social distancing should be the touchstone.</p>\n<p>Research. Like our teaching mission, we are committed to continuing our research mission while making sure we take steps to keep members of our community safe. We will provide guidance on this by mid-day tomorrow, Wednesday, March 18.</p>\n<p>GUIDANCE FOR EMPLOYEES</p>\n<p>All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools or UVA Health. The latter includes, among others, faculty who need to come to their classrooms or offices to teach online, and UVA Health faculty and staff who need to care for patients and support patient services. The traditional categories of “designated” and “non-designated” are helpful but not entirely relevant here, given that those categories envisioned short delays due to weather problems. School leaders, unit supervisors, and managers have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.</p>\n<p>Employee Compensation and Benefits. We are committed to our employees. We are determined to ensure that the modifications to our operations caused by the coronavirus will not impact our existing commitments to compensate and continue existing benefits for UVA employees, whether part time or full time. We will, therefore, honor all existing commitments for the foreseeable future. The length of this crisis is difficult to predict at this point, as are the economic ramifications. There may come a point where we need to reassess in light of the length of time of the crisis or significantly changes circumstances, but our hope and plan is to weather this crisis together.</p>\n<p>To be clear, those who must report for work will have to do so. Those who can work remotely will have to do so. Those who fall into neither category may be asked to perform other functions for their units or schools or to take on tasks elsewhere at the University. Whether or not these employees are able to be re-deployed, we will honor existing employment commitments for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Contract Employees. We have relationships with a wide range of contractors across the University, which present a variety of situations. We are in active conversations with these contractors and hope to be able to provide an update fairly soon.</p>\n<p>Student Employees. This change in operations will have an impact on our student employees as well. Students who are teaching assistants or working on research will continue to be paid if they continue their work. Student employees who are able to complete their duties remotely can do so with the approval of their supervisor. Students should submit timesheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage. Student in the Federal Work Study program (FWS) will continue to be paid an average of their current wages bi-weekly through the end of the semester. Students on FWS who will continue to work remotely should submit time sheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage.</p>\n<p>For the safety of students and the others with whom they may come into contact, non FWS student employees who cannot work remotely will not be eligible to continue working while the University’s operating schedule is modified due to COVID-19. We understand that this will cause some students financial hardship, and we will do whatever we can to help. If you are in need of financial support, please connect with your supervisor, who has received a list of emergency financial resources available to displaced student employees.</p>\n<p>MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICES; CREDITS OR REFUNDS FOR HOUSING AND DINING</p>\n<p>On-Grounds Housing Will Be Further Restricted. As our resources and on-site staffing levels diminish due to social distancing directives, and due to increasing emphasis on the importance of social distancing, we will only be able to provide on-Grounds Housing for a very limited number of residents. Only students who have no other option will be permitted to remain on-Grounds. As a reminder, students who are returning solely to collect some of their belongings still have until Wednesday, March 18 at noon to do so. If you are not able to collect your belongings before then, please do not return to Grounds until you hear from us with guidance, which will be coming soon. We will provide details about when and how students will be able to gather all of their belongings.</p>\n<p>Any students who stayed in on-Grounds Housing following our initial request to return home must make plans to leave by Friday, March 20 unless they meet one of the following criteria: 1) international students who are unable to secure travel to return home; 2) persons for whom their on-Grounds residence is their only home (including graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff for whom their on-Grounds residence is their permanent address); or 3) students for whom traveling home would present a severe health or safety risk. Housing &#x26; Residence Life will contact students who completed the original survey to remain on Grounds, and work with them to transition back home. As before, students currently receiving financial aid with questions related to financial resources for departing Grounds should contact UVA Student Financial Services at sfs@virginia.edu or 434.982.6000.</p>\n<p>We are urging undergraduate and graduate students who live off-Grounds to follow these guidelines as well .</p>\n<p>Dining</p>\n<p>Dining options will be very limited. Effective immediately, Observatory Hill Dining Hall will serve as the only major dining facility in service, apart from those necessary to support UVA Health. Those using O-Hill can obtain their meals there but will not be able to eat inside the facility. Please visit the University’s Dining website for hours of operation and real-time updates. Wherever possible, we encourage students who have kitchens in their place of residence to prepare their own meals.</p>\n<p>Credits or Refunds for Housing and Dining</p>\n<p>We will provide pro-rated credits to student accounts for on-Grounds Housing and UVA dining contracts. We will send additional information on the mechanics of this process in a later communication, but students will have the ability to either request a refund or allow the credit to remain on their student account to apply to future bills. As long as students remain enrolled through the end of the spring semester, financial aid will not be impacted.</p>\n<p>We are making a number of modifications to various services. Dining services, as described above, will be limited to take out/grab and go only. All libraries will be closed, except to faculty and staff who need to use them for teaching online classes or clinical care. Student activity spaces, like those in Newcomb Hall, 1515, and the Student Activities Building, will be closed. All gyms and fitness facilities on Grounds will be closed. University venues such as the museums, the McCormick Observatory, and the Rotunda will be closed to the public. Bus service will be reduced. More details will be forthcoming with respect to all of these topics and will be posted on the University’s coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>This message covers sweeping changes that would usually be made only after months of consideration and discussion. In the face of this rapidly evolving public health crisis, however, we have been called to make the best decisions we can in a limited amount of time in order to look out for the health and safety of our community, both at the University and in the surrounding Charlottesville region. Implementing these changes will no doubt be difficult, and we know further questions will arise, but we remain as confident as ever in our community’s ability to navigate this unprecedented set of challenges together. In the meantime, our profound thanks to everyone in this community for your dedication, creativity, and compassion.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>March 17: UVA Outlines Child Care Options for Employees</p>\n<p>Dear UVA Health Community:</p>\n<p>To address the extensive caregiving needs created by the K-12 school closure, the University has expanded our caregiving support network.

At this point, some of you are probably trying to figure out how to support your family and your career while schools are closed, which is one of the reasons I’d like to share a brief reminder of our telecommuting policy.</p>\n<p>To begin, while most students are gone and online instruction will begin on Thursday, UVA remains open and operating – meaning faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. That said, our telecommuting policy is designed to give employees the flexibility to work remotely when necessary and possible.</p>\n<p>If you need to work remotely, please talk to your manager. I realize it may be difficult to take care of your families and work remotely at the same time, which is why I encourage flexibility and creativity from both employees and managers. I would also ask that managers please give your employees the option to work remotely – provided you are still able to keep your units open for business. As a reminder, any employee who is ill should go home immediately and seek appropriate medical attention.</p>\n<p>As we announced yesterday, two weeks of additional paid leave (Public Health Emergency Leave) is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member diagnosed with the disease. This leave, however, cannot be used for child care.</p>\n<p>Employees who must stay home to care for children while schools are closed and can’t work remotely should use University Time Off (University Staff) or the equivalent for classified staff. We offer benefits to assist with care for benefits-eligible employees who need temporary care and are looking into options for providing additional care options.</p>\n<p>We will notify you if we need to make any changes to our telecommuting policy and will post any new information in the Working Remotely section of the University’s Coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for everything you are doing for UVA – every day, and especially over the last few weeks. We could not do any of this without you, and I am profoundly grateful. Lastly, updates on the coronavirus generally and our response to it will be posted regularly on our coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Kelley Stuck</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer</p>\n<p>March 16: Confirmed Case of COVID-19 in University Community</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University Community on March 16:</p>\n<p>Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:</p>\n<p>As you know from the notification received earlier today, the University has confirmed a case of COVID-19 within our community. The individual who is ill, a staff member at the UVA Women’s Center who lives off Grounds, is receiving care and in quarantine at home following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish her a speedy and full recovery.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort to identify individuals who were in contact with the staff member, reaching out to those individuals, and arranging for their isolation. University staff are also working to support potentially impacted students, faculty and staff. In addition, the UVA Women’s Center is being vacated and deep-cleaned with products that kill the coronavirus in accordance with CDC guidelines.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. If you exhibit these symptoms, please contact your health care provider and follow their instructions before leaving your home and potentially putting others at risk:</p>\n<p>Students: Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.</p>\n<p>Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.

If you do not have a primary care physician you may call the Virginia Department of Heath hotline at 877-ASK-VDH3 (877-275-8343).</p>\n<p>As we work together as a community to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>Additional information is available from the CDC.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all you are doing during this challenging time to safeguard your own health and that of others.

You can also consult the University’s Novel Coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Given the progression of the virus, it is not a surprise to discover a local case, but we know it will heighten anxiety. We will be in further touch to announce any additional changes we are making as the situation unfolds, and we will continue to update the website. Now, more than ever, is the time to treat each other with kindness and compassion.

I realize you have been receiving a great many messages from the University this week, so I am going to highlight my most important points up front. First, if you can return to your home, we need you to do so as soon as possible. Second, if you are away from Grounds and only need a few essential belongings, we can help.</p>\n<p>Now, the details:</p>\n<p>If you live on Grounds: With your permission, we can arrange for a staff person to go to your room, retrieve essential items you need, and ship them to you. You also are welcome to have a friend do this. To make arrangements for either, please contact housing@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>If you live off Grounds: We have enlisted the help of primary landlords in the area. If you need items from your home or apartment, please call your landlord for help with this or other critical matters. We also hope those of you residing in fraternity and sorority houses will return home. We have been in contact with alumni house corporation officers to seek their (and your) cooperation. If you have friends still in town, please consider asking for their help in collecting your belongings before they leave.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, some leases require that you let your landlord know, in writing, if you will be gone for a week or more. Please check your lease and make sure you follow these and other instructions. If you don't have a copy of your lease, ask your landlord to email it to you.</p>\n<p>It is very important that you return home and be ready to start virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We know some of you will need to stay due to unavoidable circumstances, but otherwise, you should be returning home right away. If you need to return to collect your belongings from your apartment or residence hall, please make every effort to make your trip as brief as possible. We are facing a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. You are risking not only your own health if you continue to gather in groups and circulate in the area, but also – of critical importance – you are risking the health of others in our community who are likely to be more affected by this disease.</p>\n<p>International students and those living a great distance from Grounds: If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.</p>\n<p>Student Workers: Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work. This flexibility applies to students who started classes this spring and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place. The employment of other student workers is under discussion by University leadership, but nothing has been determined at this point.</p>\n<p>Financial concerns: The University is committed to assisting students in need during this unprecedented time. If you are currently receiving financial aid and have questions about resources for leaving Grounds and returning home, please contact UVA Student Financial Services through a special website for Emergency Travel Assistance.</p>\n<p>Online resources: We recognize what an abrupt and challenging transition it will be to shift to virtual classes. Faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and you will have support from the University. You will be able to link to resources through the coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all the steps you are taking to help us respond to this health crisis. This is an unprecedented situation in our lifetimes, and I respectfully ask each of you to do the responsible thing as citizens in a larger community. Your willingness to comply with what is being asked of you will help the broader community – including many at-risk individuals – minimize the impact of this crisis as much as possible. Unlike some crises we witness from afar, this is one where we can each take action that has a tangible result. Individual actions will make a huge difference in how we face and eventually spring back from this difficult challenge. In this case, a selfless decision on your part may save a life.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Allen W. Groves</p>\n<p>University Dean of Students</p>\n<p>March 13: Message Urges Parents to Help Ensure Students Return Home</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered on March 13 to UVA parents and guardians of students:</p>\n<p>Dear Parents and Guardians:</p>\n<p>I am writing to you as someone who cares deeply about your students' safety, health, and well-being. We are facing a public health crisis worldwide, nationwide, and here in Virginia.</p>\n<p>On behalf of the University and larger Charlottesville community, I am appealing to you if your student has told you they want to remain here: We need your help ensuring your student returns home and is ready to begin virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We recognize a small number of students cannot leave due to unavoidable circumstances, and we will continue to support those students, but we need all other students to return home for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>We are especially concerned right now about students living off Grounds. Last night, a number of students were celebrating on the Corner, and a rumor is circulating about more gatherings this evening. We need your assistance in helping them understand the dangers posed by COVID-19. While they may not become sick or may suffer only mild symptoms, they could potentially infect residents in the local community who could contract the disease and become acutely ill.</p>\n<p>We made the very difficult decision to move our classes to virtual instruction not only based on the health and welfare of our students, but also because we want to ensure that the UVA Health System, a Level 1 trauma center, is not stretched too thin in the coming weeks and months. We believe the fewer students in Charlottesville right now, the better for our health system and, thus, for the health and welfare of everyone in the region.</p>\n<p>Mitigating this crisis must be a community-wide effort, and we have enlisted the help of the area's primary landlords, asking them to reiterate these concerns to their student-tenants. Yesterday, we engaged alumni who manage Greek housing, asking their help as well. If your student lives off Grounds and needs individual help with matters like retrieving their most important belongings, they should contact their landlord directly. If your student encounters difficulty after contacting their landlord, please have them email the Office of the Dean of Students at odos@virginia.edu for assistance.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if your student lives on Grounds and they need a few essential things from their room, they can have a friend pick up the items or arrange for a staff member to enter their room to get the items and ship them. For help with this – only if your student lives in on-Grounds housing – please email housing@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>Your student will be hearing more from the University soon about the transition to virtual classes. We know this will be an abrupt and challenging transition, but faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and your student will have support from the University. In addition, Allen Groves, University Dean of Students, will be communicating soon with your student to further clarify a variety of questions that have arisen.</p>\n<p>Thank you to each of you for your help and support. I know there are many whose student is already at home or planning to be at home soon. We are grateful for your partnership and quick action.</p>\n<p>In my 40 years at the University, I have faced many crises, yet none like this. Most of our students have no memory of September 11. This, however, is a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. We must help them understand how vital it is to unite around this crisis. The COVID-19 health crisis is forcing each of us to make sacrifices and changes none of us wants to make. In the end, however, it is not about us. It’s about our responsibility to our fellow human beings. Thank you for all you and your student are doing during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Finally, please continue to check our coronavirus website, which is being updated continually with new information. If you have questions, please call our Response Lines at 877-685-4836: domestic; 1-202-800-2408: international; or email covidinformation@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>March 12: More details about COVID-19 changes</p>\n<p>Dear members of the UVA Community:</p>\n<p>I write to provide a few updates following President Ryan’s email from yesterday about the steps the University is taking in response to the COVID-19 threat. If you have not yet done so, I encourage you to read his message closely.</p>\n<p>To review, President Ryan announced a series of actions yesterday—gearing up to deliver classes on-line as of March 19th, strongly encouraging students to return home if they can, and prohibiting certain events on Grounds. These actions are all guided by the the desire (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. We can advance all of those goals by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds.</p>\n<p>Today we are providing additional updates and announcing several additional changes, some of which are relevant to the entire community, and some of which are specific to faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>First, the more general updates:</p>\n<p>We will be making a decision about Final Exercises by April 15th.</p>\n<p>We know this is top of mind for many of you, especially graduating students, and we are working as fast as we can to give you some clarity – understanding that we don’t yet know what the situation will look like in May.</p>\n<p>Events at John Paul Jones Arena are postponed at least through the weekend.</p>\n<p>Please visit www.johnpauljonesarena.com for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster.</p>\n<p>for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster. We will continue to work with performers and others involved in events scheduled to take place at John Paul Jones arena to evaluate additional upcoming events.</p>\n<p>The ACC has suspended the Spring Athletics season.</p>\n<p>Earlier today, the ACC announced that they have suspended all athletic related activities. This means that all Spring sports at UVA are canceled.</p>\n<p>Fans who have already purchased tickets may contact the Virginia Athletics Ticket Office by phone at 800-542-8821 or by email at uvatickets@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>We are looking into offseting dining and housing costs for students.</p>\n<p>We have set up a Financial Resource Working Group that is looking into, among other things, offsetting dining and housing costs for students. More details will follow soon.</p>\n<p>We also have a Student Life and Leadership fund, which is a rainy day fund distributed by the Student Affairs Office for students with unexpected expenses.</p>\n<p>Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work.</p>\n<p>This flexibility applies to students who started classes for the Spring 2020 term and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place.</p>\n<p>If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.</p>\n<p>Early this morning, the University suspended all of its current study-abroad programs, and encouraged all UVA students to return to the United States by this weekend. The International Studies Office contacted participants in these programs individually.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Below are more specific updates for faculty, staff, and graduate students working on Grounds.</p>\n<p>Let me start by acknowledging how difficult this situation is for all members of our University community and express the leadership’s deep gratitude for your hard work and your dedication to UVA’s missions.</p>\n<p>The University is open and operating.</p>\n<p>Given normal operations, faculty and staff should continue to report to work as usual (you can find more detail on our human resources policies below).</p>\n<p>We will begin scaling back some services, like dining and bus service, but will still meet the needs of employees and the limited number of students who will be remaining on Grounds. Any changes in these services will be posted on the Operations Status Board , and details will be available on departmental websites.</p>\n<p>, and details will be available on departmental websites. Libraries will remain open from 8am to 5pm daily, with the possible exception of weekends. Some locations that depend heavily on student workers may close.</p>\n<p>We are monitoring this rapidly evolving situation closely. A cross-university team, including medical professionals, meets daily. If any modification to the University’s operating schedule becomes necessary, we will let you know immediately.</p>\n<p>Human Resources: All faculty and staff should continue reporting to work, but employees will be eligible for a new leave benefit.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. However, when possible, we do encourage managers to consider options for staff and faculty to work from home. You can find answers to questions about working remotely here .</p>\n<p>. If you have an underlying health condition that necessitates working from home, please talk to your manager, department chair, or dean. They, in turn, are encouraged to be flexible if an employee has a compromised health situation or is caring for someone who does.</p>\n<p>As of today, all employees, including wage and temporary employees, are eligible for up to two weeks of leave if they have been impacted by the virus. This includes employees in both the Academic Division and Medical Center.</p>\n<p>This leave is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member who diagnosed with the disease. More details on this new policy can be found here or you can contact the or contact the HR Solution Center at AskHR@virginia.edu or 434-243-3344.</p>\n<p>Teaching continuity: We are working to support faculty as classes move online.</p>\n<p>We have an all-hands-on-deck approach to bringing our teaching on line. Below are updates on some of the key developments from the cross-university team that is working on this.</p>\n<p>We sent out a survey to faculty and instructors yesterday to determine the support needed to move classes online and we have a plan in place to provide support – either centrally or through schools. If you received the survey and have not responded, please respond immediately. The responses to the survey will be critical to understanding the needs and responding to them.</p>\n<p>You can find general information on teaching continuity here . More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found here .</p>\n<p>. More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found . We are working to identify and support any students who might have connectivity or other assistance needs in accessing online instruction. As a reminder, while online classes will begin on March 19th, there will be no in-person classes between now and March 19th. That is, we are taking a pause in classes. Given that this is only 3 days (similar to snow days in the past), we are confident that we will complete the term with the teaching days available.</p>\n<p>Research continuity: We have plans in place to ensure research can continue.</p>\n<p>Faculty, staff, and postdocs engaged in research are permitted to continue that research. Principle Investigators can designate some of their laboratory staff and postdocs as essential to the continuity of their research.</p>\n<p>Graduate students whose research takes place in the University’s labs will continue to have access to those facilities in consultation with their faculty advisors. Graduate students with appointments as research assistants should be in touch with their faculty advisors to learn about any changes to the activities of their research group.</p>\n<p>We do not know how disruptive this virus will be and encourage anyone conducting research to begin planning for what to do if that research gets disrupted. We have created a research continuity website with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan.</p>\n<p>with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan. All PIs with an active open research grant have been reached individually. There will be additional guidance for social and behavioral sciences, as well as for patient care-based clinical trials, shortly.</p>\n<p>We are suspending all international and non-essential domestic University travel, effective immediately and continuing at least through April 15th.</p>\n<p>International Travel for University business</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, we are prohibiting all University-related international travel by faculty and staff. If you require an exception, please submit a request to the Provost’s office at COVIDTravel@virginia.edu. Requests will require an endorsement of the employee’s dean, vice president, vice provost, or manager.</p>\n<p>Domestic Travel for University business</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, we are suspending all non-essential domestic travel. Essential travel is defined as supporting activities that are absolutely necessary, cannot be rescheduled, and must be done in person. If a supervisor, associate dean, or dean deems the travel essential, it will be reimbursed. If not, it will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Return from international travel</p>\n<p>If you do travel internationally, it is important to note that return may be difficult. As a result of the U.S. Presidential Proclamation on March 11 th , University faculty and staff who have been in Europe’s Schengen area (26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted travel between them) in the previous 14 days before re-entry to the United States will face enhanced screening procedures for returning to the U.S. Please consult the Center for Disease Control for details.</p>\n<p>, University faculty and staff who have been in Europe’s (26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted travel between them) in the previous 14 days before re-entry to the United States will face enhanced screening procedures for returning to the U.S. Please consult the for details. University faculty and staff who are not American citizens or legal permanent residents of the United States who have been in the Schengen area in the previous 14 days may not travel to the United States, even with currently valid nonimmigrant visas, for the 30 day period beginning at midnight, March 13th. We are currently exploring whether the U.S. government may change this policy, and will share more information as we get it.</p>\n<p>Return from personal travel</p>\n<p>We ask all University employees to take account of this guidance as they evaluate their own personal travel.

If you have a question that isn’t covered on either of these sites, contact the travel team at travel@virginia.edu or 434-924-4121</p>\n<p>Event restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>To re-emphasize, President Ryan’s message yesterday announced two policies about University-sponsored events: 1) we have suspended all university-sponsored events that involve more than 100 people and; 2) for events that involve fewer than 100 people, we strongly recommend alternatives to having an in-person event and, if that is not possible, taking all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of infection. We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.</p>\n<p>Deans, vice presidents, vice provosts, or unit heads (or their designees) will apply these rules. Any leader with questions about a specific event should direct those questions to the Office of Major Events at uvaome@virginia.edu.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I want to thank all of you again for your patience and understanding. We will continue to share as much information as possible as soon as we can, and we will do our best to answer any questions that may come up. Please continue to visit the University’s Novel Coronavirus website, which is updated regularly and provides answers to many frequently asked questions.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>March 11: University Moves All Courses Online, Urges Students to Return Home</p>\n<p>To the University community,</p>\n<p>I write to share an update on our response to the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, and our plans for the remainder of the Spring semester.</p>\n<p>To begin with the basic and important news:</p>\n<p>We will be moving our classes online. We will not be holding classes on Grounds for the foreseeable future, quite possibly through the end of the semester. We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date.</p>\n<p>We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date. Online classes will begin Thursday, March 19.</p>\n<p>Students who are away on Spring Break are strongly encouraged to return home or to remain home if they are already there.</p>\n<p>Students on Grounds and in Charlottesville are strongly encouraged to return home by this weekend .</p>\n<p>. University events with more than 100 people are prohibited for the foreseeable future and should be postponed, cancelled, or offered virtually.</p>\n<p>These are obviously significant steps that will cause disruption and disappointment, which we all regret. We nonetheless feel compelled to take these steps in light of the most recent evidence. The virus continues to spread nationally and in Virginia. We still do not yet have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, so our risk remains relatively low. Given that fact, the easiest and least disruptive option would have been to bring all students back to Grounds as planned and hope to make it through the rest of the semester without a confirmed case. We also considered bringing students back and moving only large classes online.</p>\n<p>After talking more with medical experts, however, and as the evidence of the spread here and abroad mounts, we believe that these approaches would not be sufficient and would create too much risk, especially for our health system and the medical center, which is a Level 1 trauma center and may be stretched to the limits in the coming weeks and months. Experts have also told us that the best time to take steps to prevent that spread is now, before the first case arrives.</p>\n<p>Our approach here is guided by three goals: (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. All of those goals are advanced by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds. We cannot eliminate all risks, of course, but we believe at this time these steps will help mitigate the risks we face.</p>\n<p>To be clear, the University – including university buildings and UVA Health – will remain open, and we will bring students back to Grounds as soon as we can do so safely. While we hope to do so before the end of the semester, we may not be able to and are working on a number of contingency plans, including plans for graduation.</p>\n<p>A few notes for specific groups:</p>\n<p>Students</p>\n<p>If you are currently away on Spring Break, we strongly encourage you to stay home or return to your home . Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>. Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming. If you are currently in Charlottesville, we strongly encourage you to return home .</p>\n<p>This strong request applies to all students regardless of where you are living – whether on Grounds or off.</p>\n<p>whether on Grounds or off. We recognize that some students cannot go home, for a variety of reasons, ranging from the fact that their hometowns or countries are not safe to the fact that their only homes are in Charlottesville. We will continue to provide housing for students living on Grounds who genuinely cannot return home, and we will continue to provide dining services, though they will be modified. We will also offer assistance to students on financial aid who need help in returning to their homes.</p>\n<p>With the help and creativity of faculty and staff, we will make sure you are able to meet your academic requirements remotely, and we will pay special attention to graduating students. You will be hearing from deans and professors over the next week with details about your classes, including any clinical, experiential, performance-based, or studio learning that may require alternative arrangements.</p>\n<p>Faculty</p>\n<p>All faculty will be hearing from their deans soon with more details about moving classes online.</p>\n<p>We are standing up a team to provide the necessary training and technology to move courses online.</p>\n<p>While some research will be put on hold, we have plans in place to allow core research operations to continue. Those of you who are conducting research will be hearing from our Provost, Liz Magill, and our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian, with more details soon.</p>\n<p>Staff</p>\n<p>For the time being, staff should continue reporting to work as usual and take the recommended steps to prevent illness. A full list can be found here .</p>\n<p>. Staff with questions or concerns about their workplaces and the possibility of telecommuting should speak with their supervisors. We ask that staff who are feeling sick to please remain at home.</p>\n<p>Events</p>\n<p>Effective immediately and until further notice, we are suspending all university-sponsored events that involve more than 100 people.</p>\n<p>For events that involve fewer than 100 people, we strongly recommend alternatives to having an in-person event and, if that is not possible, taking all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of infection. We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.</p>\n<p>At this time, these restrictions do not apply to athletic events or events at JPJ, both of which remain under discussion and consideration.</p>\n<p>We realize you will likely have questions, both about this decision and about COVID-19 in general. Starting today, you can go to this website for more information, and we have set up a call center (Domestic: 877-685-4836; International: +1 202-800-2408) with staff trained to answer the most common questions. We will also be sending out more detailed communications about various elements of this plan, which we will also post on the website. As this is an evolving situation, we will also provide updates if there are significant changes to the plan outlined in this email.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank the teams from across the University who have been working incredibly hard over the last few weeks, and who will keep working hard to make this transition as smooth as possible. I am deeply grateful that UVA is home to so many expert, capable people who are dedicated to the well-being of our community and to our critical missions of teaching, research, and clinical care.</p>\n<p>I would also like to thank all of you for your patience and understanding. Put simply, UVA has never encountered something quite like this. There is no roadmap for trying to put most of the University curriculum online in a week. But I have enormous faith in this community – in your resilience, your willingness to do your part to keep others safe, and your ability to make the most of a very difficult situation.</p>\n<p>I have special faith in our students, for whom the health risks are generally low and for whom the disappointments are high, but who I know will recognize that now is the time to think first of the well-being of others.</p>\n<p>We are in this together, though I recognize that the impact will be uneven. As the father of a graduating senior at another university who has been asked to return home, I know this decision will hit our fourth-year students especially hard. It will also create economic challenges and hardships for some in the Charlottesville community whose livelihoods depend on our students. We will make it through this together by supporting each other, thinking creatively, and staying connected even if physically separated. I cannot pretend, obviously, that this is how I hoped this semester would unfold. No one can. But I eagerly await the ingenuity, compassion, and kindness that this common challenge will surely unlock within our community. If there were ever a time to be both great and good, this is surely it.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Jim</p>\n<hr>\n<p>James E. Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>March 8: Coronavirus Updates on University Preparedness, Travel, and Operations</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University community on March 8.</p>\n<p>Dear members of the University community:</p>\n<p>Like all of you, I am concerned about the presence of the novel coronavirus in the United States and abroad and its potential effect on students, families, employees, and community members. I write today to share the latest information we have and some decisions we have made to look out for the wellbeing of our University community and the greater Charlottesville region.</p>\n<p>There has not been a case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, but the Virginia Department of Health has confirmed two cases of COVID-19 in the Commonwealth, both in Northern Virginia. Our immediate risk remains low. The situation, however, is rapidly evolving, much remains unknown about the threats posed by COVID-19, and we take very seriously the responsibility to make prudent choices for the wellbeing of our community. A cross-university team continues to meet regularly to share information in real-time, consider changes in approach that will best protect our community, and set plans in motion for a wide variety of contingencies. I am in contact with them daily, and Provost Magill and I will continue to regularly update the community, through messages and on our website, about what we know and our plans.</p>\n<p>Consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Department of State, and the Virginia Department of Health, we have decided to enact the following restrictions and guidelines on University-related travel in order to help to mitigate our community’s risk of exposure to the virus:</p>\n<p>International Travel</p>\n<p>University-related travel to countries where the CDC has enacted level 3, or the State Department has enacted levels 3 or 4 is prohibited.CDC travel guidance related to COVID-19 is available here.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff who have exceptional reasons to travel to those countries may submit a petition to the Provost’s office via an email to COVIDtravel@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>International travel to restricted areas without an approved petition will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>If you travel or have recently traveled to one of these countries, we expect you to follow CDC guidance about self-isolation: stay home for a period of 14 days upon your return and seek medical attention if you experience fever, coughs, or difficulty breathing.</p>\n<p>Domestic Travel</p>\n<p>At this point, we are not prohibiting university-related domestic travel, but we strongly discourage all University travel (both domestic and international) for non-essential purposes, particularly that by air, to large gatherings, and to areas experiencing high numbers of COVID-19 cases, as documented by the CDC. If you must travel, please take all possible precautions before traveling, including staying up to date on the latest spread of the virus and considering difficulties you may encounter in returning home, especially when traveling internationally.</p>\n<p>These guidelines will be effective immediately and will be in place until at least April 15. Before April 15, we will re-assess and determine whether these policies will continue.</p>\n<p>While these guidelines apply to University-related travel, we ask members of the community to apply similar judgment in considering personal travel commitments, both internationally and domestically.</p>\n<p>Spring Break and Beyond</p>\n<p>Many of our students are currently away on Spring Break, so the pace of events on Grounds has slowed for the week ahead. Unless local conditions change, University sponsored events, programs, tours, and operations will continue as planned during Spring Break. We will continue to monitor this issue carefully, relying on guidance from internal experts at UVA Health, the Virginia Department of Health, and the CDC.</p>\n<p>We will write again by the middle of the week with additional updates regarding University programming during the weeks following Spring Break. At this point in time, we plan for students to return to Grounds and to resume classes, but we will be making some modifications to mitigate against the risk of exposure to and transmission of the virus, which we will explain in more detail by mid-week.</p>\n<p>This is a challenging time for our community, the nation, and the world as we respond to COVID-19 and the uncertainty surrounding it. We will do our best to stay on top of this quickly evolving situation, and to communicate with you regularly and fully as conditions change. I am grateful to all of you for your understanding and flexibility, and for your commitment to the wellbeing of our community. This is a time for our community to come together, and acting together, I remain confident in our ability to navigate this difficult and uncertain period.</p>\n<p>For more information, please consult our website, which we are continually updating.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 3: Important Updates Related to Spring Break and Student, Faculty and Staff Travel</p>\n<p>The following message to the University community was delivered March 3.</p>\n<p>Dear members of the UVA community:</p>\n<p>Since our last University-wide communication on February 28, the number of national coronavirus (COVID-19) cases continues to rise. While we are not aware of any cases in Virginia, the safety of the UVA and Charlottesville communities is our primary concern. I write to share with you the proactive steps we are taking. Note that this guidance is subject to change as the situation is rapidly evolving. You can find updates and resources on the University’s website.</p>\n<p>Spring Break Study Abroad</p>\n<p>The University has canceled all outbound study abroad programs scheduled over spring break. We notified affected faculty program directors and students today. Schools will work directly with students to arrange for completion of coursework through alternative means.</p>\n<p>Our decision on spring break trips was guided by the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) March 1st recommendation that Universities should reconsider study abroad travel. It is in everyone’s best interest that students avoid unnecessary travel through crowded transportation hubs for short visits to uncertain environments before they return to Grounds. We feel this is the best decision to protect our students and our local community where students will return after their travel.</p>\n<p>We are in close, regular communication with those students who are currently abroad on exchange and other programs, regarding how to monitor and assess their current situations based on conditions in the country they are visiting.</p>\n<p>Travel Guidance</p>\n<p>The CDC maintains a Travel Information website related to COVID-19, and specifically recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to countries at Warning Level 3. Note that these ratings can change rapidly.</p>\n<p>We urge faculty, staff, and students who have personal or professional plans to travel either internationally or to affected areas in the U.S. to reconsider their travel. In doing so, we ask each of you to take into account the possibility of travel delays, future quarantines, or prolonged self-isolation when returning from travel to the UVA and Charlottesville communities.</p>\n<p>If you have travel insurance, you should closely review your plan to assure it does not exclude pandemics in the case of need for medical evacuation.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage faculty and staff to share any travel plans with your department chair, dean, or manager in order to facilitate University assistance if the need arises.</p>\n<p>We strongly urge student organizations (CIOs) to share any travel plans with the Office of the Dean of Students.</p>\n<p>The decisions we are making rely heavily on the guidance we are receiving from the CDC and the Virginia Department of Health and are intended to protect the health and welfare of our faculty, staff, students, and local community. We recognize the uncertainty this global health issue is creating and are committed to keep you informed and up to date as this situation evolves. You may find updates and current information on the University’s website and FAQ.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>Feb. 28: Message of Solidarity from Provost Magill</p>\n<p>The following message to Chinese faculty, students, staff and scholars was delivered Feb. 28.</p>\n<p>Dear colleagues:</p>\n<p>Today I’m writing to you – our esteemed faculty, staff, and scholars from China – to express the University’s concern and support for you as the coronavirus continues to spread in China and beyond. We understand how worried you must be about your family and friends who are contending with the virus and its effects. As an expression of our support, we made this video, and we have shared it widely with members of our UVA family who are in China.</p>\n<p>UVA officials are carefully monitoring the spread of the virus and listening closely to advice and directives coming from the CDC, the Virginia Department of Health, and the federal government. We are offering online resources via the coronavirus website and through the coronavirus FAQs, which we are updating frequently. If you have questions or concerns that are not addressed in these materials, please call our faculty and staff coronavirus phone line at 434-297-4027.</p>\n<p>We have heard that some of you feel an obligation to offer support to students from China who are here at UVA. We are grateful for your willingness to comfort and advise our students in this way; at the same time, we realize that this responsibility may feel overwhelming. In addition to using the resources above, students can reach counselors at CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) at 434-243-5150, 24 hours a day. The International Studies Office (ISO) is also available to assist students who are studying here from abroad, and we have support resources available for faculty and staff through the Faculty &#x26; Employee Assistance Program.</p>\n<p>As we continue to contend with the coronavirus, please know that we are thinking of you and your families, friends, and colleagues, and we are committed to providing the support you need during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Warmly,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>Feb. 26: Update on Coronavirus for UVA Students</p>\n<p>The following message to University students was delivered Feb. 26:</p>\n<p>Important Reminders: Spring Break Health and Safety</p>\n<p>To: All Students</p>\n<p>From: Allen W. Groves, University Dean of Students</p>\n<p>odos@virginia.edu</p>\n<p>Dear Students:</p>\n<p>Since many of you soon will be leaving Charlottesville for Spring Break, I am writing with several important reminders about health and safety.</p>\n<p>If you follow the news, you already know the global coronavirus outbreak is a major concern for anyone considering international travel at this time. The virus has spread to areas of the world beyond China with an accelerating and unpredictable trajectory. This threat will likely grow. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced this week that the virus is expected to impact the United States in a more severe way than it has to date.</p>\n<p>Traveling abroad – whether for study or leisure – carries a number of potential risks. Even a country not currently experiencing an outbreak could suddenly be declared a high-risk area, resulting in heightened exposure to the virus, difficulty with departure, immigration barriers in returning to the U.S., and even possible restrictions on returning to Grounds. The University strongly recommends not traveling to locations with CDC or State Department Level 3 alerts or higher. While we have not cancelled any current or existing study abroad programs, the University will cancel any such programs, even if already under way, at any location for which the CDC sets a warning level 3, or the State Department sets a warning level 3 or 4.</p>\n<p>The seasonal flu also is present in many areas. Basic measures remain the best defense against coronavirus, flu, and other communicable diseases:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with soapy water.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Cough and sneeze into a tissue or your elbow.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>TRAVEL PREPARATION</p>\n<p>The CDC maintains a travel information website for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>\n<p>for coronavirus (COVID-19). CDC Warning Level 3 is in effect for China and South Korea (as of Feb. 24).</p>\n<p>CDC Alert Level 2 is in effect for Iran, Italy, and Japan (as of Feb. 23).</p>\n<p>Be familiar with all aspects of the area you are visiting.

As we experience a global pandemic that is expected to worsen in coming days in our area of the country, the University is joining with entities at the local, regional and state level to share resources that may be needed for the health and well-being of our fellow citizens.</p>\n<p>You and your student already are making personal sacrifices that none of us fully envisioned even a month ago. I’m writing today to thank you for all you are doing and to share more information about plans that will have an impact on a small contingent of students and their families. Although this does not affect all of you, I believe it’s important for all of our students and families to understand what – and why – certain decisions have been made in recent days.</p>\n<p>As a state institution with a public trust and mission, we have a duty to share our resources in times of crisis. Our facilities are owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia. It’s our good fortune that the UVA Hospital, a nationally renowned, level one trauma center, is part of our extended Grounds. We offer major resources that can help those suffering from COVID-19 and other illnesses, as well as assist the many doctors, nurses and staff members who are caring for them. Our resources are part of the bigger picture that emergency planners are reviewing to determine a comprehensive, joint response to aid the Central Virginia area.</p>\n<p>At the same time these plans are evolving, we must adhere to medical guidance and concerns for the safety and health of you, your families, our staff members and people in Charlottesville. Many of you have understandably wanted to return to the Grounds to pick up your students’ belongings if they lived in a residence hall. That simply is not possible given all the current concerns about the spread of COVID-19. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, but only when consistent with public health and safety.</p>\n<p>The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds. We are in contact with the some 250 undergraduate students who remain so they are aware of how to access services if they need help.</p>\n<p>Emergency Use of Bond, Bice, Shea, French and Spanish Houses. As part of the overall efforts addressing the COVID-19 crisis, the University recently was asked to provide housing in residence halls near the hospital. The buildings include Bice, Bond, Shea, and the French and Spanish houses. This weekend, eight students who had remained in those five buildings were relocated to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley, located on the opposite side of Grounds.</p>\n<p>As part of this process to answer the call of projected emergency needs, we now must carefully pack up and store all the possessions of students who had lived in those five buildings. The residents of those buildings received an email with details on Sunday and are being asked to complete a questionnaire to help direct the vendor we have retained for packing, moving and storage. A second email further clarifying the process was distributed yesterday. Students who received the questionnaire need to complete it by tomorrow, April 8, so the vendor can handle students’ possessions as carefully as possible and in accordance with their preferences.</p>\n<p>The University is covering the full cost of packing and storing items from these five buildings. Students only need to pay if they want to go to the storage warehouse and pick up their belongings before some point in the future when conditions are safer and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has lifted the stay-home order issued last week. Once a timeframe is set, the vendor will deliver everyone’s packed belongings to a central area of the Grounds where students and parents can pick them up. A range of dates and times for pick-up will be available.</p>\n<p>Governor Northam’s Executive Order. If you live in Virginia, then you know Gov. Northam issued an Executive Order last week directing Virginians to stay at home until June 10. This order, and previous guidance from the governor and other officials, has guided our decisions since mid-March about students returning to Grounds.</p>\n<p>The majority of our students are no longer in Charlottesville. A significant number, however, remain in off-Grounds apartments or houses. By and large, they are following social distancing guidelines and not gathering in groups larger than 10. I have seen exceptions, however, most notably on the UVA Lawn. Enjoying the beautiful spring weather is certainly not a problem, but if you think your student needs a reminder about not gathering in groups larger than 10, please help us out. It’s for their own safety and that of others. The asymptomatic spread of the novel coronavirus poses major concerns.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal Deadline Extended. For students only in the College of Arts &#x26; Sciences, the date to withdraw from the spring term has been changed to May 8 (it had previously been April 14). All College students now have until May 8 to withdraw from the spring 2020 term and return in fall 2020 (or summer). Students in the College have received a notification about this.</p>\n<p>Message from Dean Groves. All students received a message yesterday from University Dean of Students Allen Groves. He reminded students of the importance of social distancing and covered several other important topics, including the possibility of unemployment benefits for students who had part-time jobs and are now having difficulty paying rent or other major expenses. He also listed the many services available remotely, including the services of Student Health and Counseling &#x26; Psychological Services. I encourage you to read his message and ensure your student reads it.</p>\n<p>The University is committed to sharing updates with you as information is available, but we remain in a fluid situation marked by numerous uncertainties. Thank you for all you are doing to support your student as they finish this semester remotely. I hope you and your families are weathering this crisis as well as possible.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>April 6: Ryan Announces Emergency Fund to Assist Contract Workers, UVA Employees</p>\n<p>The following email was distributed to members of the University community on Monday:</p>\n<p>To the University community:</p>\n<p>I am writing to let you know about efforts we are making to support workers furloughed by our contractors and about a contribution to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation.</p>\n<p>A core aspiration of our strategic plan is to be a university that is both great and good. Toward that end, we have committed to doing our best to be a good neighbor and to live our values. That means, among other things, doing what we can to support our most vulnerable community members.</p>\n<p>We have kept our employees on our payroll, and we will continue to do so for as long as we can. Some of our contractors, including Aramark, have furloughed their employees. More may do so in the future. These workers are entitled to state and federal unemployment benefits, as well as some benefits being offered directly by their employers.</p>\n<p>It has become clear that these benefits are not flowing as quickly as any of us would like, and that our contract workers need immediate assistance. It is also clear that there may be a gap between the relief available from unemployment benefits and meeting the necessities of life. Our own employees may also be facing unexpected costs due to the crisis we are all facing.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we are devoting $2 million to create an emergency assistance fund for UVA contract workers and employees. We cannot provide a salary or wages to those who have been furloughed, because doing so would make them ineligible for the state and federal benefits that exist for those who are unemployed. But we can provide funding to help meet an array of needs related to the crisis. Our primary focus will be to help those who have been furloughed, but this fund will also be available for those still employed and facing unexpected costs.</p>\n<p>We will also be providing assistance to furloughed contract workers who need help in applying for state and federal unemployment benefits, and we expect this fund to be a helpful bridge to those who are awaiting benefits. We will keep this fund operational until June 1, and we will reassess at that point.</p>\n<p>We will have more details to share by mid-week, including a timeline and process for accessing the funds. A number of you have contacted me about helping out your colleagues, and I’m grateful for your interest and compassion. To facilitate that help, we are setting up a process for employees to donate directly to this fund.</p>\n<p>We are also committed to being a good neighbor to the Charlottesville region. For that reason, we are also contributing $1 million to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation to support their efforts to stabilize households during this pandemic. The Foundation has already raised over $2.3 million to support these efforts, and they are doing great work and deserve our support. For anyone who needs immediate assistance, please call their Community Resource Helpline at 434-234-4490.</p>\n<p>We will have more to say later this week about additional steps we are going to take to support our community, but I did not want to wait to get this information out. We face challenges ahead. We will only get through them by working together and doing what we can to support each other. Thanks for all of your efforts in that regard.</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>April 5: Update from the Dean of Students</p>\n<p>Dear Undergraduate, Graduate and Professional School Students:</p>\n<p>I’m writing today to offer updates on a few subjects, and also to check in on you. As April begins, it’s still somewhat difficult to fully grasp all that has occurred over the past few weeks. I imagine you are feeling a range of emotions. I hope as you deal with this upheaval in your life you will take some time for self-care and reflection. If you are spending major portions of your day in front of a computer instead of in a classroom or research lab or library with the friends, advisors, colleagues, and the routines you had come to enjoy, social isolation can be a real problem. Feelings of distance, loneliness, and even depression can result. Many of us feel a bit of “cabin fever” and that’s quite natural. Things as simple as taking a long walk and enjoying nature can help in dealing with the uncertainty everyone is feeling now.</p>\n<p>I urge you to stay connected with your friends and whoever else lifts your spirits. Prioritize your health, including getting adequate sleep, moving your muscles, and eating nutritiously. If you would like to speak with a counselor at any point, we continue to offer services through CAPS and Student Health remotely. Please see the end of this message for resources and contact information.</p>\n<p>If you are having difficulty with your courses, either because of the material, online delivery, or other issue, please reach out for help. If you are an undergraduate student, please call on your professor, teaching assistant, academic advisor, association dean (if in the College), or perhaps engage with a tutor or peer. Graduate and professional students should reach out to their professor, advisor, research director, department chair, or academic dean.</p>\n<p>• Governor Northam’s Executive Order. The warm spring weather can be a soothing antidote to stress, but it carries a risk as well. It remains very important to practice social distancing and abide by local directives. While it will be tempting to gather outside in groups, it is essential that you follow orders like those issued by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to maintain social distancing and only go out for essential needs. The Governor’s most recent Executive Order directs Virginians to stay at home through June 10. This does not preclude going out for a walk, for example, but if you go with a few friends, you should be mindful of keeping a distance of at least six feet between you. No groups of 10 or more can gather outside or elsewhere in Virginia, on public or private property. Many other states have similar restrictions aimed at “flattening the curve” and avoiding larger scale COVID-19 infections that may overwhelm our health care system.</p>\n<p>• Doing Our Part. We know the COVID-19 crisis is worsening in most of the country, including in Virginia. University leaders are responding by turning significant attention to our health system and standing ready to support the consolidated, joint efforts of emergency teams in the Charlottesville community and larger central Virginia area. As a state institution with a public trust and mission, it is our duty to respond to requests for use of our facilities and resources at the local, regional, state, and national levels.</p>\n<p>• Emergency Use of Residence Halls. Within the past few days, we have responded to requests from emergency planners to make residence hall space available near the UVA Hospital. The 15 undergraduate students who still resided in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses have been relocated this weekend, with help from the teams in Housing &#x26; Residence Life and Facilities Management, to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley. Additionally, students who had been living in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses – but had left Charlottesville previously – have been notified that the University will be carefully packing and storing their belongings at no cost to students, so the buildings can be used to support needs arising from this crisis. (Students can also choose to have their belongings shipped to them at their expense.)</p>\n<p>This crisis bears similarities to war efforts of the past when citizens had to make sacrifices and pull together for the greater good. I regret some decisions have come very quickly with little advance communication, but the situation is exceptionally fluid right now and the University is part of larger efforts with new priorities emerging daily. Whenever possible, we are committed to communicating with you in advance and as fully as possible. We will always endeavor not simply to tell you what action is being taken, but also why.</p>\n<p>• Retrieving Belongings from the Residence Halls. Given medical guidance and concerns for the health of you, your families, and people in Charlottesville, it will not be possible for students who were living in residence halls to come back to the Grounds at this time to retrieve personal possessions from on-Grounds residences. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, and only when consistent with public health and safety. The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds.</p>\n<p>• Support for International Students. Of special note is that many of the undergraduate and graduate students remaining on Grounds and in our Charlottesville community are international students. We recognize the special challenges they face being far from home. We communicated last week with all students remaining on Grounds and emphasized how they can access needed services. For our international students in particular, we want to underscore our condemnation of, and resolve to combat, any acts of bias or xenophobia against them. If you have been the target of such an act, please report it through the University’s Just Report It system. Of course, if you believe you are ever in immediate danger, you should always call 911.</p>\n<p>• Financial Hardships. Without question, the coronavirus crisis is taking an economic toll on many, including our students, faculty and staff, and their families. The University is examining how costs and losses are affecting our operations. This includes the recognition that some families who have been hit especially hard may need to update their financial information with Student Financial Services for purposes of calculating institutional aid and access to other resources.</p>\n<p>Many students have expressed considerable concern about losing their wages from part-time jobs, affecting their ability to pay rent and other major expenses. Please note, the Student Legal Services office, which is staffed by attorney Lester Wilson and funded by the Student Activity Fee, may be a resource to assist you. More information is available on the Student Legal Services website.</p>\n<p>New federal legislation may also grant part-time student workers eligibility for unemployment benefits through the Virginia Employment Commission. Students who had part-time jobs, but are currently unemployed, can apply now on the VEC website. Applicants will need to renew their claims weekly, preferably Mondays through Wednesdays. The VEC website states VEC is still awaiting guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, so the timing of funding is uncertain. If you are a part-time student worker who lost your job in another state, you should apply using that state’s website to seek unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p>We are grateful to our graduate students for the support they continue to provide to the University’s core missions of teaching and research. For those students who are serving as Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs), the University’s policy on continuity of pay is noted on the Human Resources website. During the spring term, GTAs continue in their roles of working with faculty in teaching remotely for the remainder of the semester, while GRAs and research fellows continue to work with their faculty advisors and supervisors to engage in the activities of their research groups, including continuing research remotely to the extent possible. We know how disruptive this pandemic has been to the academic careers of our graduate students. The Provost and the Vice President for Research continue to work with the deans and faculty to find ways to ensure the success of our graduate students during this time of disruption in their education and research.</p>\n<p>Emergency funding continues to be available for all students in need. As a reminder, three forms of funding are available:</p>\n<p>• Final Exercises. Having walked the Lawn myself as a graduating student, I fully recognize the importance of walking the Lawn for our graduating students and their families. Last month, President Ryan asked Pam Higgins, Executive Director for Major Events in the President’s Office, and me to lead a working group of undergraduate and graduate students and representatives from the schools to recommend ways for a meaningful celebration still to occur on the Lawn. We hope to present recommendations soon to President Ryan and his senior leadership team. You should expect to hear directly from President Ryan on this topic in the coming weeks, as he is committed to seeing this through for you.</p>\n<p>• Providing Support. Many of you have expressed interest in supporting the University Health System and our local community, and we have seen many gestures of generosity. If you would like to learn more about how you can support the care needs of the Health System, please visit their website.</p>\n<p>With six weeks remaining in the semester, I hope to communicate several more times before everyone finishes the term. I personally want to stay connected with you, and I feel it is important for you to receive regular updates about important student topics and how the University is responding to the coronavirus crisis.</p>\n<p>I wish the best to each of you and your families.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Allen W.

But I realize many of you may be wondering about Governor Northam’s Executive Order, which was released this afternoon. So before I get to the summer programs, let me say a few words about the Governor’s Executive Order.</p>\n<p>The order requires all Virginia residents to remain at home, unless they are traveling to and from work or seeking essential services like medical care, food, or banking. Institutions of higher education, like UVA, “shall cease all in-person classes and instruction, and cancel all gatherings of more than ten individuals. For purposes of facilitating remote learning, performing critical research, or performing essential functions, institutions of higher education may continue to operate, provided that social distancing requirements are maintained.”</p>\n<p>This order is consistent with the decisions we have made over the last few weeks and will not change the way we are currently operating. If more changes become necessary, we will let you know.</p>\n<p>As far as this summer is concerned, in keeping with our decisions about this semester, we have decided to cancel all in-person summer programs through June 30th, 2020. “Summer programs” include classes, conferences, camps, and other events that are scheduled to occur on Grounds through June 30th.</p>\n<p>This means that classes offered during Summer Session 1 and 2 will move online. You can find more information about Summer Session at <a href=\"https://summer.virginia.edu/\">https://summer.virginia.edu/</a>. By June 1st, we will make a decision about in-person summer programs occurring after July 1st.</p>\n<p>As always, please visit <a href=\"https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus</a> for the most up-to-date information on our response to COVID-19 and answers to frequently asked questions. I hope that you and yours are safe and healthy.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>March 23: Provost Clarifies the State of Research and Warns of Potential Shutdown</p>\n<p>Dear UVA Faculty and those involved in the research enterprise:</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience as we work together to tackle this fast-moving and complex public health crisis. We understand this has been a difficult period, including for those engaged in the important task of research, whether they do their work in a lab or in an office or in the field. As you know, last week, the University announced extraordinary measures to “flatten the curve” even as we work to continue our missions of teaching, research, and clinical care. The following day, the University announced that these measures apply to the research enterprise.</p>\n<p>This message follows up on this March 20 communication from our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian. I write to: i) provide two reminders; ii) to clarify the University’s approach to the engagement of graduate students in research during this period; and iii) to emphasize that all engaged in the research enterprise should be preparing for the possibility of a shutdown of ongoing research and resorting only to the maintenance of key laboratory assets.</p>\n<p>First, two reminders:</p>\n<p>I want to reaffirm the University position on research: As announced last week, the research enterprise should be shifting to key functions only – and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked here . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school.</p>\n<p>– and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school. In keeping with the University-wide approach to “flattening the curve”: All employees, including those engaged in the research enterprise, who can work from home, must work from home and their supervisor (here, PI) must require that they do so. Like all managers, a PI can “designate” a category of employees who must report in person to perform key functions. In keeping with efforts to “flatten the curve,” this category must be as small as possible to perform those tasks and the PI must assure that the safest practices are followed.</p>\n<p>Second, regarding the role of graduate students in the days ahead:</p>\n<p>As a matter of principle, the University position is that graduate students are – first and foremost – students . We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future.</p>\n<p>. We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future. Given their status as students, the rule is this: a faculty member is not permitted to “designate” a graduate student, which would mean that the graduate student must report in person to perform key tasks. This rule is subject to narrow exceptions (decided through a process described below) if the PI/Research Leader and graduate student jointly request an exception.</p>\n<p>Exceptions : I will, after consulting with others (the relevant school dean, the VPR, and the EVPHA) determine whether an exception to this rule will be granted. Petitions to permit a graduate student to continue in-person work should be submitted by the PI and as the form indicates with the consent of the graduate student to the Provost’s Office by using this form.</p>\n<p>Third, it is critical that all PIs/Research Leaders plan for a shutdown of ongoing research. We do not know if or when that might occur; as has happened in some other states, it is possible that the decision will be required by a government order over which we have little control. Given this, it is crucial that researchers have a plan to preserve the vital material that is essential for research (for example, animals, cells, continuously run instruments and machines, special materials, and reagents). This task of preservation and planning will assure that, if we must pause our ongoing research, we will be positioned to return to this important endeavor whenever the pause is over. Believe me, all of us wish we could predict if and when we might have to shut down ongoing research; but we do not yet know. I assure you that we will continue to keep the UVA research community up to date in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and generosity of spirit during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 19: New Cases of COVID-19 Includes UVA Student</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University community on March 19:</p>\n<p>Dear University community:</p>\n<p>Earlier today the Virginia Department of Health confirmed three new cases of COVID-19 in the Charlottesville area.</p>\n<p>One of those cases is a UVA student who lives off Grounds in Albemarle County. The student, who is believed to have contracted the virus during recent international travel, is in isolation and receiving care following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish this student a speedy recovery during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort, with the assistance of University officials, to identify people who were in contact with this individual, reaching out to those individuals and arranging for their self-isolation, if necessary.</p>\n<p>The health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority. We realize a case of COVID-19 within our student body creates a heightened sense of anxiety and concern. The University coronavirus page offers a number of resources to help community members stay healthy and to cope with the strain this period is placing on all of us.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, as we work together to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>Additional information is available from the CDC.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, please respond to this email at covidinformation@virginia.edu or call 877-685-4836 (domestic) or 1-202-800-2408 (international).</p>\n<p>We have posted notification of this recent case on the UVA Coronavirus website. As a result of the expected spread of the coronavirus and the development of additional testing capacity, there will likely be additional cases in the coming days. We will not be emailing about each of them, but our default will be to post notifications of new cases to the coronavirus website and to email about new cases sparingly.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for your continued support and compassion during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Christopher P. Holstege, M.D.</p>\n<p>Department of Student Health &#x26; Wellness</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>March 18: Provost Outlines Undergraduate Grading Policy for Online Courses</p>\n<p>Dear UVA faculty, students, and staff:</p>\n<p>We are facing extraordinary challenges as a result of COVID-19. As the letter President Ryan and I shared yesterday made clear, this has required rapid and consequential decision making. In seeking to fulfill our academic mission, our guiding principles are clear: We will work to protect our University community and our neighbors, and we will do all we can to continue educating our students and pursuing our research. The effort to sustain our educational mission has required enormous effort and creativity by thousands of faculty and staff. As we launch tomorrow into our rapid transition from in-person to online instruction for the remainder of this semester, I am writing to provide direction on how we will handle grading for undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>For this semester, for our undergraduate schools, credit/no credit (CR/NC) will be the default grading system for all classes where the work is not yet completed; students will also, however, have the option to receive a letter grade. Students must decide whether to receive a letter grade by the last day of spring semester classes, Tuesday, April 28th. We will be in touch about the process for making that choice as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Several other details are important:</p>\n<p>Courses taken for CR/NC during Spring 2020 will count toward curricular, major, and graduation requirements. Such grades are not factored into a student’s GPA. Students who remain in the CR/NC option must complete the class with a grade of C or better to receive credit.</p>\n<p>This policy applies only to undergraduate level courses. The deans of the graduate and professional programs are considering how they will approach this question, and they will soon announce their decisions to their schools.</p>\n<p>UVA will include a designation on students’ transcripts to indicate that the CR/NC option was created in the midst of an extraordinary crisis and as part of the University’s effort to manage the transition to online instruction.</p>\n<p>These are not ordinary times. Every day, I am struck anew by the enormity of the challenges and the enormity of the effort being brought to bear to meet those challenges. As we resume the semester with online courses tomorrow, I want to thank all of you for your ingenuity, understanding, and patience. I remain confident in our collective ability to navigate this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 18: Provost Outlines Guidance for Maintaining Research Continuity</p>\n<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>\n<p>I write to provide an update on our approach to research, as promised in yesterday's University message. In consultation with President Ryan, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Craig Kent, and Vice President for Research Ram Ramasubramanian, the following principles are guiding our efforts on research. Research, like education, is central to the University's mission. Similar to our extraordinary effort to move classes online, we are taking dramatic steps to respond to this public health crisis while continuing our research mission.</p>\n<p>In keeping with, and directly quoting, yesterday’s message: “All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools, or UVA Health.” This directive applies to all University employees. Like managers across Grounds, Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers “have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.”</p>\n<p>We all remain grateful for your patience and partnership as we face these unprecedented times. In addition to the University’s coronavirus website, please visit the Vice President for Research website for specific resources and detailed guidance. Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers can find detailed research continuity guidelines here.</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 17: COVID-19 Causes Sweeping Changes to University Operations</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University Community on March 17:</p>\n<p>To the University community,</p>\n<p>We write with some important updates across a range of issues. As you know, this is an unprecedented and very rapidly changing situation, and all of us are learning more every day. At this point, it seems imperative that we do our very best to slow the progression of this virus in order to “flatten the curve” of those infected and avoid overwhelming our health system, which would ultimately risk our patients, our community, and our Charlottesville neighbors. This requires taking some significant, additional steps at this point.</p>\n<p>We realize and regret that these additional steps will cause more disappointment and call for more sacrifice, but we see no other way to do our part to help confront this public health crisis. We must also be mindful of the need of our students, their families, and our faculty and staff to plan, and we need to be mindful of protecting our faculty and staff, who make this place run. For all of those reasons, today we are announcing the following changes, including adjustments to classes, research, and events; guidance for employees; and modifications to services.</p>\n<p>These changes will go into effect immediately wherever possible, though we recognize that some may take a bit of time to implement fully, as explained more below.</p>\n<p>ADJUSTMENTS TO CLASSES, RESEARCH, AND EVENTS</p>\n<p>Classes will remain online throughout the semester. It is exceedingly unlikely, based on all that we know at this point, that this virus will have abated by the end of April. In light of the need for faculty, staff, and students to make plans, we are making the decision now – rather than waiting until April 5 – to not hold any classes on Grounds this semester. For students who do not have the technology needed to complete their classes online, please visit our technology support fund page and read the instructions and guidelines completely. We are in active discussions about what changes we might make to our normal grading system this semester. We will be back in touch soon, once we have made a decision.</p>\n<p>Final Exercises will not proceed as planned. In light of the evidence about the likely progression of the virus over the next couple of months, and when it will peak, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Final Exercises as currently planned. We did not make this decision lightly, as we know how disappointing it will be to graduating students and their families. That said, a team is already focused on developing creative alternatives to mark this important occasion, and we will communicate updates as we have them.</p>\n<p>All events on Grounds are cancelled, no matter the size, until at least May 15. We had originally cancelled events over 100, but on Sunday the CDC suggested no groups larger than 50, and just recently the White House and the Governor of Virginia suggested gatherings of no more than 10 people. Rather than continue to chase the ever-shrinking size limitations, we want to be clear that all events should be cancelled this semester. These restrictions include events that are not University-sponsored, but are planned to occur on Grounds, including conferences, symposia, and social gatherings. This does not preclude small internal meetings, where social distancing should be the touchstone.</p>\n<p>Research. Like our teaching mission, we are committed to continuing our research mission while making sure we take steps to keep members of our community safe. We will provide guidance on this by mid-day tomorrow, Wednesday, March 18.</p>\n<p>GUIDANCE FOR EMPLOYEES</p>\n<p>All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools or UVA Health. The latter includes, among others, faculty who need to come to their classrooms or offices to teach online, and UVA Health faculty and staff who need to care for patients and support patient services. The traditional categories of “designated” and “non-designated” are helpful but not entirely relevant here, given that those categories envisioned short delays due to weather problems. School leaders, unit supervisors, and managers have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.</p>\n<p>Employee Compensation and Benefits. We are committed to our employees. We are determined to ensure that the modifications to our operations caused by the coronavirus will not impact our existing commitments to compensate and continue existing benefits for UVA employees, whether part time or full time. We will, therefore, honor all existing commitments for the foreseeable future. The length of this crisis is difficult to predict at this point, as are the economic ramifications. There may come a point where we need to reassess in light of the length of time of the crisis or significantly changes circumstances, but our hope and plan is to weather this crisis together.</p>\n<p>To be clear, those who must report for work will have to do so. Those who can work remotely will have to do so. Those who fall into neither category may be asked to perform other functions for their units or schools or to take on tasks elsewhere at the University. Whether or not these employees are able to be re-deployed, we will honor existing employment commitments for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Contract Employees. We have relationships with a wide range of contractors across the University, which present a variety of situations. We are in active conversations with these contractors and hope to be able to provide an update fairly soon.</p>\n<p>Student Employees. This change in operations will have an impact on our student employees as well. Students who are teaching assistants or working on research will continue to be paid if they continue their work. Student employees who are able to complete their duties remotely can do so with the approval of their supervisor. Students should submit timesheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage. Student in the Federal Work Study program (FWS) will continue to be paid an average of their current wages bi-weekly through the end of the semester. Students on FWS who will continue to work remotely should submit time sheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage.</p>\n<p>For the safety of students and the others with whom they may come into contact, non FWS student employees who cannot work remotely will not be eligible to continue working while the University’s operating schedule is modified due to COVID-19. We understand that this will cause some students financial hardship, and we will do whatever we can to help. If you are in need of financial support, please connect with your supervisor, who has received a list of emergency financial resources available to displaced student employees.</p>\n<p>MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICES; CREDITS OR REFUNDS FOR HOUSING AND DINING</p>\n<p>On-Grounds Housing Will Be Further Restricted. As our resources and on-site staffing levels diminish due to social distancing directives, and due to increasing emphasis on the importance of social distancing, we will only be able to provide on-Grounds Housing for a very limited number of residents. Only students who have no other option will be permitted to remain on-Grounds. As a reminder, students who are returning solely to collect some of their belongings still have until Wednesday, March 18 at noon to do so. If you are not able to collect your belongings before then, please do not return to Grounds until you hear from us with guidance, which will be coming soon. We will provide details about when and how students will be able to gather all of their belongings.</p>\n<p>Any students who stayed in on-Grounds Housing following our initial request to return home must make plans to leave by Friday, March 20 unless they meet one of the following criteria: 1) international students who are unable to secure travel to return home; 2) persons for whom their on-Grounds residence is their only home (including graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff for whom their on-Grounds residence is their permanent address); or 3) students for whom traveling home would present a severe health or safety risk. Housing &#x26; Residence Life will contact students who completed the original survey to remain on Grounds, and work with them to transition back home. As before, students currently receiving financial aid with questions related to financial resources for departing Grounds should contact UVA Student Financial Services at sfs@virginia.edu or 434.982.6000.</p>\n<p>We are urging undergraduate and graduate students who live off-Grounds to follow these guidelines as well .</p>\n<p>Dining</p>\n<p>Dining options will be very limited. Effective immediately, Observatory Hill Dining Hall will serve as the only major dining facility in service, apart from those necessary to support UVA Health. Those using O-Hill can obtain their meals there but will not be able to eat inside the facility. Please visit the University’s Dining website for hours of operation and real-time updates. Wherever possible, we encourage students who have kitchens in their place of residence to prepare their own meals.</p>\n<p>Credits or Refunds for Housing and Dining</p>\n<p>We will provide pro-rated credits to student accounts for on-Grounds Housing and UVA dining contracts. We will send additional information on the mechanics of this process in a later communication, but students will have the ability to either request a refund or allow the credit to remain on their student account to apply to future bills. As long as students remain enrolled through the end of the spring semester, financial aid will not be impacted.</p>\n<p>We are making a number of modifications to various services. Dining services, as described above, will be limited to take out/grab and go only. All libraries will be closed, except to faculty and staff who need to use them for teaching online classes or clinical care. Student activity spaces, like those in Newcomb Hall, 1515, and the Student Activities Building, will be closed. All gyms and fitness facilities on Grounds will be closed. University venues such as the museums, the McCormick Observatory, and the Rotunda will be closed to the public. Bus service will be reduced. More details will be forthcoming with respect to all of these topics and will be posted on the University’s coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>This message covers sweeping changes that would usually be made only after months of consideration and discussion. In the face of this rapidly evolving public health crisis, however, we have been called to make the best decisions we can in a limited amount of time in order to look out for the health and safety of our community, both at the University and in the surrounding Charlottesville region. Implementing these changes will no doubt be difficult, and we know further questions will arise, but we remain as confident as ever in our community’s ability to navigate this unprecedented set of challenges together. In the meantime, our profound thanks to everyone in this community for your dedication, creativity, and compassion.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>March 17: UVA Outlines Child Care Options for Employees</p>\n<p>Dear UVA Health Community:</p>\n<p>To address the extensive caregiving needs created by the K-12 school closure, the University has expanded our caregiving support network. These services are either subsidized or fully reimbursed. For details and directions on how to register, visit the HR Caregiving Website.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bright Horizons Back-up Care</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Care is provided either at a licensed care facility or in-home by care providers who have been screened, trained and background-checked. It is strongly recommended you sign up to be eligible in advance of needing care.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Bright Horizons Crisis Care Assist</li>\n</ol>\n<p>UVA team members enrolled in the Bright Horizons Back-up Care program (above) also have the option to source their own child and/or elder care and receive reimbursement through the Crisis Care Assist program.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Sittercity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>UVA now has a new partnership with Sittercity.com to match team members who are unable to source their own care with professional caregivers.</p>\n<p>Call for Caregivers!</p>\n<p>Due to high demand of caregivers needed for child/elder care, we are asking anyone who is available to provide care to please register as a caregiver in this time of need. For more details and to register, please see the HR Caregiving Website.</p>\n<p>We understand the tremendous impact school closure is having on you and your families, therefore, we continue to explore more services to help deal with this burden.</p>\n<p>Kelley Stuck</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer</p>\n<p>Josh Christian</p>\n<p>Senior Director HR - UVA Health</p>\n<p>March 17: Update on University’s Telecommuting Policy</p>\n<p>Dear colleagues,</p>\n<p>Yesterday Governor Northam announced that all K-12 schools in Virginia will be closed for a minimum of two weeks, beginning on Monday, March 16th. At this point, some of you are probably trying to figure out how to support your family and your career while schools are closed, which is one of the reasons I’d like to share a brief reminder of our telecommuting policy.</p>\n<p>To begin, while most students are gone and online instruction will begin on Thursday, UVA remains open and operating – meaning faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. That said, our telecommuting policy is designed to give employees the flexibility to work remotely when necessary and possible.</p>\n<p>If you need to work remotely, please talk to your manager. I realize it may be difficult to take care of your families and work remotely at the same time, which is why I encourage flexibility and creativity from both employees and managers. I would also ask that managers please give your employees the option to work remotely – provided you are still able to keep your units open for business. As a reminder, any employee who is ill should go home immediately and seek appropriate medical attention.</p>\n<p>As we announced yesterday, two weeks of additional paid leave (Public Health Emergency Leave) is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member diagnosed with the disease. This leave, however, cannot be used for child care.</p>\n<p>Employees who must stay home to care for children while schools are closed and can’t work remotely should use University Time Off (University Staff) or the equivalent for classified staff.

The individual who is ill, a staff member at the UVA Women’s Center who lives off Grounds, is receiving care and in quarantine at home following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish her a speedy and full recovery.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort to identify individuals who were in contact with the staff member, reaching out to those individuals, and arranging for their isolation. University staff are also working to support potentially impacted students, faculty and staff. In addition, the UVA Women’s Center is being vacated and deep-cleaned with products that kill the coronavirus in accordance with CDC guidelines.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. If you exhibit these symptoms, please contact your health care provider and follow their instructions before leaving your home and potentially putting others at risk:</p>\n<p>Students: Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.</p>\n<p>Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.

If you do not have a primary care physician you may call the Virginia Department of Heath hotline at 877-ASK-VDH3 (877-275-8343).</p>\n<p>As we work together as a community to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>Additional information is available from the CDC.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all you are doing during this challenging time to safeguard your own health and that of others. If you have additional questions about the University’s efforts regarding COVID-19, please contact the UVA COVID-19 Response Line at 1-877-685-4836 (domestic), +1-202-800-2408 (international), or covidinformation@virginia.edu. You can also consult the University’s Novel Coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Given the progression of the virus, it is not a surprise to discover a local case, but we know it will heighten anxiety. We will be in further touch to announce any additional changes we are making as the situation unfolds, and we will continue to update the website. Now, more than ever, is the time to treat each other with kindness and compassion. We are beyond grateful to everyone who has been working so hard on behalf of our community.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>James E. Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>Craig Kent</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President for Health Affairs</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>March 14: Academic Division Provided Details on UVA Telecommuting Policy</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to UVA’s Academic Division staff on March 14:</p>\n<p>Dear colleagues,</p>\n<p>Yesterday Governor Northam announced that all K-12 schools in Virginia will be closed for a minimum of two weeks, beginning on Monday, March 16th. At this point, some of you are probably trying to figure out how to support your family and your career while schools are closed, which is one of the reasons I’d like to share a brief reminder of our telecommuting policy.</p>\n<p>To begin, while most students are gone and online instruction will begin on Thursday, UVA remains open and operating—meaning faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. That said, our telecommuting policy is designed to give employees the flexibility to work remotely when necessary and possible.</p>\n<p>If you need to work remotely, please talk to your manager. I realize it may be difficult to take care of your families and work remotely at the same time, which is why I encourage flexibility and creativity from both employees and managers. I would also ask that managers please give your employees the option to work remotely—provided you are still able to keep your units open for business. As a reminder, any employee who is ill should go home immediately and seek appropriate medical attention.</p>\n<p>As we announced yesterday, two weeks of additional paid leave (Public Health Emergency Leave) is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member diagnosed with the disease. This leave, however, cannot be used for childcare.</p>\n<p>Employees who must stay home to care for children while schools are closed and can’t work remotely should use University Time Off (University Staff) or the equivalent for classified staff. We offer benefits to assist with care for benefits-eligible employees who need temporary care and are looking into options for providing additional care options.</p>\n<p>We will notify you if we need to make any changes to our telecommuting policy and will post any new information in the Working Remotely section of the University’s Coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for everything you are doing for UVA—every day, and especially over the last few weeks. We could not do any of this without you, and I am profoundly grateful. Lastly, updates on the coronavirus generally and our response to it will be posted regularly on our coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Kelley Stuck</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer</p>\n<p>March 13: Students Urged to Return Home; UVA Can Assist With Moving Out</p>\n<p>The following message was distributed to University of Virginia students March 13 by Dean of Students Allen Groves:</p>\n<p>Dear Students:</p>\n<p>Much has occurred in the past week since your Spring Break began. I realize you have been receiving a great many messages from the University this week, so I am going to highlight my most important points up front. First, if you can return to your home, we need you to do so as soon as possible. Second, if you are away from Grounds and only need a few essential belongings, we can help.</p>\n<p>Now, the details:</p>\n<p>If you live on Grounds: With your permission, we can arrange for a staff person to go to your room, retrieve essential items you need, and ship them to you. You also are welcome to have a friend do this. To make arrangements for either, please contact housing@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>If you live off Grounds: We have enlisted the help of primary landlords in the area. If you need items from your home or apartment, please call your landlord for help with this or other critical matters. We also hope those of you residing in fraternity and sorority houses will return home. We have been in contact with alumni house corporation officers to seek their (and your) cooperation. If you have friends still in town, please consider asking for their help in collecting your belongings before they leave.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, some leases require that you let your landlord know, in writing, if you will be gone for a week or more. Please check your lease and make sure you follow these and other instructions. If you don't have a copy of your lease, ask your landlord to email it to you.</p>\n<p>It is very important that you return home and be ready to start virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We know some of you will need to stay due to unavoidable circumstances, but otherwise, you should be returning home right away. If you need to return to collect your belongings from your apartment or residence hall, please make every effort to make your trip as brief as possible. We are facing a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. You are risking not only your own health if you continue to gather in groups and circulate in the area, but also – of critical importance – you are risking the health of others in our community who are likely to be more affected by this disease.</p>\n<p>International students and those living a great distance from Grounds: If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.</p>\n<p>Student Workers: Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work. This flexibility applies to students who started classes this spring and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place. The employment of other student workers is under discussion by University leadership, but nothing has been determined at this point.</p>\n<p>Financial concerns: The University is committed to assisting students in need during this unprecedented time. If you are currently receiving financial aid and have questions about resources for leaving Grounds and returning home, please contact UVA Student Financial Services through a special website for Emergency Travel Assistance.</p>\n<p>Online resources: We recognize what an abrupt and challenging transition it will be to shift to virtual classes. Faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and you will have support from the University. You will be able to link to resources through the coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all the steps you are taking to help us respond to this health crisis. This is an unprecedented situation in our lifetimes, and I respectfully ask each of you to do the responsible thing as citizens in a larger community. Your willingness to comply with what is being asked of you will help the broader community – including many at-risk individuals – minimize the impact of this crisis as much as possible. Unlike some crises we witness from afar, this is one where we can each take action that has a tangible result. Individual actions will make a huge difference in how we face and eventually spring back from this difficult challenge. In this case, a selfless decision on your part may save a life.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Allen W. Groves</p>\n<p>University Dean of Students</p>\n<p>March 13: Message Urges Parents to Help Ensure Students Return Home</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered on March 13 to UVA parents and guardians of students:</p>\n<p>Dear Parents and Guardians:</p>\n<p>I am writing to you as someone who cares deeply about your students' safety, health, and well-being. We are facing a public health crisis worldwide, nationwide, and here in Virginia.</p>\n<p>On behalf of the University and larger Charlottesville community, I am appealing to you if your student has told you they want to remain here: We need your help ensuring your student returns home and is ready to begin virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We recognize a small number of students cannot leave due to unavoidable circumstances, and we will continue to support those students, but we need all other students to return home for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>We are especially concerned right now about students living off Grounds. Last night, a number of students were celebrating on the Corner, and a rumor is circulating about more gatherings this evening. We need your assistance in helping them understand the dangers posed by COVID-19. While they may not become sick or may suffer only mild symptoms, they could potentially infect residents in the local community who could contract the disease and become acutely ill.</p>\n<p>We made the very difficult decision to move our classes to virtual instruction not only based on the health and welfare of our students, but also because we want to ensure that the UVA Health System, a Level 1 trauma center, is not stretched too thin in the coming weeks and months. We believe the fewer students in Charlottesville right now, the better for our health system and, thus, for the health and welfare of everyone in the region.</p>\n<p>Mitigating this crisis must be a community-wide effort, and we have enlisted the help of the area's primary landlords, asking them to reiterate these concerns to their student-tenants. Yesterday, we engaged alumni who manage Greek housing, asking their help as well. If your student lives off Grounds and needs individual help with matters like retrieving their most important belongings, they should contact their landlord directly. If your student encounters difficulty after contacting their landlord, please have them email the Office of the Dean of Students at odos@virginia.edu for assistance.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if your student lives on Grounds and they need a few essential things from their room, they can have a friend pick up the items or arrange for a staff member to enter their room to get the items and ship them. For help with this – only if your student lives in on-Grounds housing – please email housing@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>Your student will be hearing more from the University soon about the transition to virtual classes. We know this will be an abrupt and challenging transition, but faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and your student will have support from the University. In addition, Allen Groves, University Dean of Students, will be communicating soon with your student to further clarify a variety of questions that have arisen.</p>\n<p>Thank you to each of you for your help and support. I know there are many whose student is already at home or planning to be at home soon. We are grateful for your partnership and quick action.</p>\n<p>In my 40 years at the University, I have faced many crises, yet none like this. Most of our students have no memory of September 11. This, however, is a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. We must help them understand how vital it is to unite around this crisis. The COVID-19 health crisis is forcing each of us to make sacrifices and changes none of us wants to make. In the end, however, it is not about us. It’s about our responsibility to our fellow human beings. Thank you for all you and your student are doing during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Finally, please continue to check our coronavirus website, which is being updated continually with new information. If you have questions, please call our Response Lines at 877-685-4836: domestic; 1-202-800-2408: international; or email covidinformation@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>March 12: More details about COVID-19 changes</p>\n<p>Dear members of the UVA Community:</p>\n<p>I write to provide a few updates following President Ryan’s email from yesterday about the steps the University is taking in response to the COVID-19 threat. If you have not yet done so, I encourage you to read his message closely.</p>\n<p>To review, President Ryan announced a series of actions yesterday—gearing up to deliver classes on-line as of March 19th, strongly encouraging students to return home if they can, and prohibiting certain events on Grounds. These actions are all guided by the the desire (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. We can advance all of those goals by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds.</p>\n<p>Today we are providing additional updates and announcing several additional changes, some of which are relevant to the entire community, and some of which are specific to faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>First, the more general updates:</p>\n<p>We will be making a decision about Final Exercises by April 15th.</p>\n<p>We know this is top of mind for many of you, especially graduating students, and we are working as fast as we can to give you some clarity – understanding that we don’t yet know what the situation will look like in May.</p>\n<p>Events at John Paul Jones Arena are postponed at least through the weekend.</p>\n<p>Please visit www.johnpauljonesarena.com for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster.</p>\n<p>for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster. We will continue to work with performers and others involved in events scheduled to take place at John Paul Jones arena to evaluate additional upcoming events.</p>\n<p>The ACC has suspended the Spring Athletics season.</p>\n<p>Earlier today, the ACC announced that they have suspended all athletic related activities. This means that all Spring sports at UVA are canceled.</p>\n<p>Fans who have already purchased tickets may contact the Virginia Athletics Ticket Office by phone at 800-542-8821 or by email at uvatickets@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>We are looking into offseting dining and housing costs for students.</p>\n<p>We have set up a Financial Resource Working Group that is looking into, among other things, offsetting dining and housing costs for students. More details will follow soon.</p>\n<p>We also have a Student Life and Leadership fund, which is a rainy day fund distributed by the Student Affairs Office for students with unexpected expenses.</p>\n<p>Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work.</p>\n<p>This flexibility applies to students who started classes for the Spring 2020 term and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place.</p>\n<p>If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.</p>\n<p>Early this morning, the University suspended all of its current study-abroad programs, and encouraged all UVA students to return to the United States by this weekend. The International Studies Office contacted participants in these programs individually.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Below are more specific updates for faculty, staff, and graduate students working on Grounds.</p>\n<p>Let me start by acknowledging how difficult this situation is for all members of our University community and express the leadership’s deep gratitude for your hard work and your dedication to UVA’s missions.</p>\n<p>The University is open and operating.</p>\n<p>Given normal operations, faculty and staff should continue to report to work as usual (you can find more detail on our human resources policies below).</p>\n<p>We will begin scaling back some services, like dining and bus service, but will still meet the needs of employees and the limited number of students who will be remaining on Grounds. Any changes in these services will be posted on the Operations Status Board , and details will be available on departmental websites.</p>\n<p>, and details will be available on departmental websites. Libraries will remain open from 8am to 5pm daily, with the possible exception of weekends. Some locations that depend heavily on student workers may close.</p>\n<p>We are monitoring this rapidly evolving situation closely. A cross-university team, including medical professionals, meets daily. If any modification to the University’s operating schedule becomes necessary, we will let you know immediately.</p>\n<p>Human Resources: All faculty and staff should continue reporting to work, but employees will be eligible for a new leave benefit.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. However, when possible, we do encourage managers to consider options for staff and faculty to work from home. You can find answers to questions about working remotely here .</p>\n<p>. If you have an underlying health condition that necessitates working from home, please talk to your manager, department chair, or dean. They, in turn, are encouraged to be flexible if an employee has a compromised health situation or is caring for someone who does.</p>\n<p>As of today, all employees, including wage and temporary employees, are eligible for up to two weeks of leave if they have been impacted by the virus. This includes employees in both the Academic Division and Medical Center.</p>\n<p>This leave is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member who diagnosed with the disease. More details on this new policy can be found here or you can contact the or contact the HR Solution Center at AskHR@virginia.edu or 434-243-3344.</p>\n<p>Teaching continuity: We are working to support faculty as classes move online.</p>\n<p>We have an all-hands-on-deck approach to bringing our teaching on line. Below are updates on some of the key developments from the cross-university team that is working on this.</p>\n<p>We sent out a survey to faculty and instructors yesterday to determine the support needed to move classes online and we have a plan in place to provide support – either centrally or through schools. If you received the survey and have not responded, please respond immediately. The responses to the survey will be critical to understanding the needs and responding to them.</p>\n<p>You can find general information on teaching continuity here . More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found here .</p>\n<p>. More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found . We are working to identify and support any students who might have connectivity or other assistance needs in accessing online instruction. As a reminder, while online classes will begin on March 19th, there will be no in-person classes between now and March 19th. That is, we are taking a pause in classes. Given that this is only 3 days (similar to snow days in the past), we are confident that we will complete the term with the teaching days available.</p>\n<p>Research continuity: We have plans in place to ensure research can continue.</p>\n<p>Faculty, staff, and postdocs engaged in research are permitted to continue that research. Principle Investigators can designate some of their laboratory staff and postdocs as essential to the continuity of their research.</p>\n<p>Graduate students whose research takes place in the University’s labs will continue to have access to those facilities in consultation with their faculty advisors. Graduate students with appointments as research assistants should be in touch with their faculty advisors to learn about any changes to the activities of their research group.</p>\n<p>We do not know how disruptive this virus will be and encourage anyone conducting research to begin planning for what to do if that research gets disrupted. We have created a research continuity website with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan.</p>\n<p>with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan. All PIs with an active open research grant have been reached individually. There will be additional guidance for social and behavioral sciences, as well as for patient care-based clinical trials, shortly.</p>\n<p>We are suspending all international and non-essential domestic University travel, effective immediately and continuing at least through April 15th.</p>\n<p>International Travel for University business</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, we are prohibiting all University-related international travel by faculty and staff. If you require an exception, please submit a request to the Provost’s office at COVIDTravel@virginia.edu. Requests will require an endorsement of the employee’s dean, vice president, vice provost, or manager.</p>\n<p>Domestic Travel for University business</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, we are suspending all non-essential domestic travel. Essential travel is defined as supporting activities that are absolutely necessary, cannot be rescheduled, and must be done in person. If a supervisor, associate dean, or dean deems the travel essential, it will be reimbursed. If not, it will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Return from international travel</p>\n<p>If you do travel internationally, it is important to note that return may be difficult. As a result of the U.S. Presidential Proclamation on March 11 th , University faculty and staff who have been in Europe’s Schengen area (26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted travel between them) in the previous 14 days before re-entry to the United States will face enhanced screening procedures for returning to the U.S. Please consult the Center for Disease Control for details.</p>\n<p>, University faculty and staff who have been in Europe’s (26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted travel between them) in the previous 14 days before re-entry to the United States will face enhanced screening procedures for returning to the U.S. Please consult the for details. University faculty and staff who are not American citizens or legal permanent residents of the United States who have been in the Schengen area in the previous 14 days may not travel to the United States, even with currently valid nonimmigrant visas, for the 30 day period beginning at midnight, March 13th. We are currently exploring whether the U.S. government may change this policy, and will share more information as we get it.</p>\n<p>Return from personal travel</p>\n<p>We ask all University employees to take account of this guidance as they evaluate their own personal travel. Check the state and territorial health department websites for the latest information.</p>\n<p>Reimbursement</p>\n<p>If you must cancel travel, seek waivers and refunds directly from the airlines and hotels first.

For more information, please see the “Travel and Expense” website and the more specific “Travel and COVID” site. If you have a question that isn’t covered on either of these sites, contact the travel team at travel@virginia.edu or 434-924-4121</p>\n<p>Event restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>To re-emphasize, President Ryan’s message yesterday announced two policies about University-sponsored events: 1) we have suspended all university-sponsored events that involve more than 100 people and; 2) for events that involve fewer than 100 people, we strongly recommend alternatives to having an in-person event and, if that is not possible, taking all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of infection. We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.</p>\n<p>Deans, vice presidents, vice provosts, or unit heads (or their designees) will apply these rules. Any leader with questions about a specific event should direct those questions to the Office of Major Events at uvaome@virginia.edu.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I want to thank all of you again for your patience and understanding. We will continue to share as much information as possible as soon as we can, and we will do our best to answer any questions that may come up. Please continue to visit the University’s Novel Coronavirus website, which is updated regularly and provides answers to many frequently asked questions.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>March 11: University Moves All Courses Online, Urges Students to Return Home</p>\n<p>To the University community,</p>\n<p>I write to share an update on our response to the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, and our plans for the remainder of the Spring semester.</p>\n<p>To begin with the basic and important news:</p>\n<p>We will be moving our classes online. We will not be holding classes on Grounds for the foreseeable future, quite possibly through the end of the semester. We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date.</p>\n<p>We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date. Online classes will begin Thursday, March 19.</p>\n<p>Students who are away on Spring Break are strongly encouraged to return home or to remain home if they are already there.</p>\n<p>Students on Grounds and in Charlottesville are strongly encouraged to return home by this weekend .</p>\n<p>. University events with more than 100 people are prohibited for the foreseeable future and should be postponed, cancelled, or offered virtually.</p>\n<p>These are obviously significant steps that will cause disruption and disappointment, which we all regret. We nonetheless feel compelled to take these steps in light of the most recent evidence. The virus continues to spread nationally and in Virginia. We still do not yet have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, so our risk remains relatively low. Given that fact, the easiest and least disruptive option would have been to bring all students back to Grounds as planned and hope to make it through the rest of the semester without a confirmed case. We also considered bringing students back and moving only large classes online.</p>\n<p>After talking more with medical experts, however, and as the evidence of the spread here and abroad mounts, we believe that these approaches would not be sufficient and would create too much risk, especially for our health system and the medical center, which is a Level 1 trauma center and may be stretched to the limits in the coming weeks and months. Experts have also told us that the best time to take steps to prevent that spread is now, before the first case arrives.</p>\n<p>Our approach here is guided by three goals: (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. All of those goals are advanced by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds. We cannot eliminate all risks, of course, but we believe at this time these steps will help mitigate the risks we face.</p>\n<p>To be clear, the University – including university buildings and UVA Health – will remain open, and we will bring students back to Grounds as soon as we can do so safely. While we hope to do so before the end of the semester, we may not be able to and are working on a number of contingency plans, including plans for graduation.</p>\n<p>A few notes for specific groups:</p>\n<p>Students</p>\n<p>If you are currently away on Spring Break, we strongly encourage you to stay home or return to your home . Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>. Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming. If you are currently in Charlottesville, we strongly encourage you to return home .</p>\n<p>This strong request applies to all students regardless of where you are living – whether on Grounds or off.</p>\n<p>whether on Grounds or off. We recognize that some students cannot go home, for a variety of reasons, ranging from the fact that their hometowns or countries are not safe to the fact that their only homes are in Charlottesville. We will continue to provide housing for students living on Grounds who genuinely cannot return home, and we will continue to provide dining services, though they will be modified. We will also offer assistance to students on financial aid who need help in returning to their homes.</p>\n<p>With the help and creativity of faculty and staff, we will make sure you are able to meet your academic requirements remotely, and we will pay special attention to graduating students. You will be hearing from deans and professors over the next week with details about your classes, including any clinical, experiential, performance-based, or studio learning that may require alternative arrangements.</p>\n<p>Faculty</p>\n<p>All faculty will be hearing from their deans soon with more details about moving classes online.</p>\n<p>We are standing up a team to provide the necessary training and technology to move courses online.</p>\n<p>While some research will be put on hold, we have plans in place to allow core research operations to continue. Those of you who are conducting research will be hearing from our Provost, Liz Magill, and our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian, with more details soon.</p>\n<p>Staff</p>\n<p>For the time being, staff should continue reporting to work as usual and take the recommended steps to prevent illness. A full list can be found here .</p>\n<p>. Staff with questions or concerns about their workplaces and the possibility of telecommuting should speak with their supervisors. We ask that staff who are feeling sick to please remain at home.</p>\n<p>Events</p>\n<p>Effective immediately and until further notice, we are suspending all university-sponsored events that involve more than 100 people.</p>\n<p>For events that involve fewer than 100 people, we strongly recommend alternatives to having an in-person event and, if that is not possible, taking all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of infection. We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.</p>\n<p>At this time, these restrictions do not apply to athletic events or events at JPJ, both of which remain under discussion and consideration.</p>\n<p>We realize you will likely have questions, both about this decision and about COVID-19 in general. Starting today, you can go to this website for more information, and we have set up a call center (Domestic: 877-685-4836; International: +1 202-800-2408) with staff trained to answer the most common questions. We will also be sending out more detailed communications about various elements of this plan, which we will also post on the website. As this is an evolving situation, we will also provide updates if there are significant changes to the plan outlined in this email.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank the teams from across the University who have been working incredibly hard over the last few weeks, and who will keep working hard to make this transition as smooth as possible. I am deeply grateful that UVA is home to so many expert, capable people who are dedicated to the well-being of our community and to our critical missions of teaching, research, and clinical care.</p>\n<p>I would also like to thank all of you for your patience and understanding. Put simply, UVA has never encountered something quite like this. There is no roadmap for trying to put most of the University curriculum online in a week. But I have enormous faith in this community – in your resilience, your willingness to do your part to keep others safe, and your ability to make the most of a very difficult situation.</p>\n<p>I have special faith in our students, for whom the health risks are generally low and for whom the disappointments are high, but who I know will recognize that now is the time to think first of the well-being of others.</p>\n<p>We are in this together, though I recognize that the impact will be uneven. As the father of a graduating senior at another university who has been asked to return home, I know this decision will hit our fourth-year students especially hard. It will also create economic challenges and hardships for some in the Charlottesville community whose livelihoods depend on our students. We will make it through this together by supporting each other, thinking creatively, and staying connected even if physically separated. I cannot pretend, obviously, that this is how I hoped this semester would unfold. No one can. But I eagerly await the ingenuity, compassion, and kindness that this common challenge will surely unlock within our community. If there were ever a time to be both great and good, this is surely it.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Jim</p>\n<hr>\n<p>James E. Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>March 8: Coronavirus Updates on University Preparedness, Travel, and Operations</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University community on March 8.</p>\n<p>Dear members of the University community:</p>\n<p>Like all of you, I am concerned about the presence of the novel coronavirus in the United States and abroad and its potential effect on students, families, employees, and community members. I write today to share the latest information we have and some decisions we have made to look out for the wellbeing of our University community and the greater Charlottesville region.</p>\n<p>There has not been a case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, but the Virginia Department of Health has confirmed two cases of COVID-19 in the Commonwealth, both in Northern Virginia. Our immediate risk remains low. The situation, however, is rapidly evolving, much remains unknown about the threats posed by COVID-19, and we take very seriously the responsibility to make prudent choices for the wellbeing of our community. A cross-university team continues to meet regularly to share information in real-time, consider changes in approach that will best protect our community, and set plans in motion for a wide variety of contingencies. I am in contact with them daily, and Provost Magill and I will continue to regularly update the community, through messages and on our website, about what we know and our plans.</p>\n<p>Consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Department of State, and the Virginia Department of Health, we have decided to enact the following restrictions and guidelines on University-related travel in order to help to mitigate our community’s risk of exposure to the virus:</p>\n<p>International Travel</p>\n<p>University-related travel to countries where the CDC has enacted level 3, or the State Department has enacted levels 3 or 4 is prohibited.CDC travel guidance related to COVID-19 is available here.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff who have exceptional reasons to travel to those countries may submit a petition to the Provost’s office via an email to COVIDtravel@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>International travel to restricted areas without an approved petition will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>If you travel or have recently traveled to one of these countries, we expect you to follow CDC guidance about self-isolation: stay home for a period of 14 days upon your return and seek medical attention if you experience fever, coughs, or difficulty breathing.</p>\n<p>Domestic Travel</p>\n<p>At this point, we are not prohibiting university-related domestic travel, but we strongly discourage all University travel (both domestic and international) for non-essential purposes, particularly that by air, to large gatherings, and to areas experiencing high numbers of COVID-19 cases, as documented by the CDC. If you must travel, please take all possible precautions before traveling, including staying up to date on the latest spread of the virus and considering difficulties you may encounter in returning home, especially when traveling internationally.</p>\n<p>These guidelines will be effective immediately and will be in place until at least April 15. Before April 15, we will re-assess and determine whether these policies will continue.</p>\n<p>While these guidelines apply to University-related travel, we ask members of the community to apply similar judgment in considering personal travel commitments, both internationally and domestically.</p>\n<p>Spring Break and Beyond</p>\n<p>Many of our students are currently away on Spring Break, so the pace of events on Grounds has slowed for the week ahead. Unless local conditions change, University sponsored events, programs, tours, and operations will continue as planned during Spring Break. We will continue to monitor this issue carefully, relying on guidance from internal experts at UVA Health, the Virginia Department of Health, and the CDC.</p>\n<p>We will write again by the middle of the week with additional updates regarding University programming during the weeks following Spring Break. At this point in time, we plan for students to return to Grounds and to resume classes, but we will be making some modifications to mitigate against the risk of exposure to and transmission of the virus, which we will explain in more detail by mid-week.</p>\n<p>This is a challenging time for our community, the nation, and the world as we respond to COVID-19 and the uncertainty surrounding it. We will do our best to stay on top of this quickly evolving situation, and to communicate with you regularly and fully as conditions change. I am grateful to all of you for your understanding and flexibility, and for your commitment to the wellbeing of our community. This is a time for our community to come together, and acting together, I remain confident in our ability to navigate this difficult and uncertain period.</p>\n<p>For more information, please consult our website, which we are continually updating.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 3: Important Updates Related to Spring Break and Student, Faculty and Staff Travel</p>\n<p>The following message to the University community was delivered March 3.</p>\n<p>Dear members of the UVA community:</p>\n<p>Since our last University-wide communication on February 28, the number of national coronavirus (COVID-19) cases continues to rise. While we are not aware of any cases in Virginia, the safety of the UVA and Charlottesville communities is our primary concern. I write to share with you the proactive steps we are taking. Note that this guidance is subject to change as the situation is rapidly evolving. You can find updates and resources on the University’s website.</p>\n<p>Spring Break Study Abroad</p>\n<p>The University has canceled all outbound study abroad programs scheduled over spring break. We notified affected faculty program directors and students today. Schools will work directly with students to arrange for completion of coursework through alternative means.</p>\n<p>Our decision on spring break trips was guided by the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) March 1st recommendation that Universities should reconsider study abroad travel. It is in everyone’s best interest that students avoid unnecessary travel through crowded transportation hubs for short visits to uncertain environments before they return to Grounds. We feel this is the best decision to protect our students and our local community where students will return after their travel.</p>\n<p>We are in close, regular communication with those students who are currently abroad on exchange and other programs, regarding how to monitor and assess their current situations based on conditions in the country they are visiting.</p>\n<p>Travel Guidance</p>\n<p>The CDC maintains a Travel Information website related to COVID-19, and specifically recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to countries at Warning Level 3. Note that these ratings can change rapidly.</p>\n<p>We urge faculty, staff, and students who have personal or professional plans to travel either internationally or to affected areas in the U.S. to reconsider their travel. In doing so, we ask each of you to take into account the possibility of travel delays, future quarantines, or prolonged self-isolation when returning from travel to the UVA and Charlottesville communities.</p>\n<p>If you have travel insurance, you should closely review your plan to assure it does not exclude pandemics in the case of need for medical evacuation.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage faculty and staff to share any travel plans with your department chair, dean, or manager in order to facilitate University assistance if the need arises.</p>\n<p>We strongly urge student organizations (CIOs) to share any travel plans with the Office of the Dean of Students.</p>\n<p>The decisions we are making rely heavily on the guidance we are receiving from the CDC and the Virginia Department of Health and are intended to protect the health and welfare of our faculty, staff, students, and local community. We recognize the uncertainty this global health issue is creating and are committed to keep you informed and up to date as this situation evolves. You may find updates and current information on the University’s website and FAQ.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>Feb. 28: Message of Solidarity from Provost Magill</p>\n<p>The following message to Chinese faculty, students, staff and scholars was delivered Feb. 28.</p>\n<p>Dear colleagues:</p>\n<p>Today I’m writing to you – our esteemed faculty, staff, and scholars from China – to express the University’s concern and support for you as the coronavirus continues to spread in China and beyond. We understand how worried you must be about your family and friends who are contending with the virus and its effects. As an expression of our support, we made this video, and we have shared it widely with members of our UVA family who are in China.</p>\n<p>UVA officials are carefully monitoring the spread of the virus and listening closely to advice and directives coming from the CDC, the Virginia Department of Health, and the federal government. We are offering online resources via the coronavirus website and through the coronavirus FAQs, which we are updating frequently. If you have questions or concerns that are not addressed in these materials, please call our faculty and staff coronavirus phone line at 434-297-4027.</p>\n<p>We have heard that some of you feel an obligation to offer support to students from China who are here at UVA. We are grateful for your willingness to comfort and advise our students in this way; at the same time, we realize that this responsibility may feel overwhelming. In addition to using the resources above, students can reach counselors at CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) at 434-243-5150, 24 hours a day. The International Studies Office (ISO) is also available to assist students who are studying here from abroad, and we have support resources available for faculty and staff through the Faculty &#x26; Employee Assistance Program.</p>\n<p>As we continue to contend with the coronavirus, please know that we are thinking of you and your families, friends, and colleagues, and we are committed to providing the support you need during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Warmly,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>Feb. 26: Update on Coronavirus for UVA Students</p>\n<p>The following message to University students was delivered Feb. 26:</p>\n<p>Important Reminders: Spring Break Health and Safety</p>\n<p>To: All Students</p>\n<p>From: Allen W. Groves, University Dean of Students</p>\n<p>odos@virginia.edu</p>\n<p>Dear Students:</p>\n<p>Since many of you soon will be leaving Charlottesville for Spring Break, I am writing with several important reminders about health and safety.</p>\n<p>If you follow the news, you already know the global coronavirus outbreak is a major concern for anyone considering international travel at this time. The virus has spread to areas of the world beyond China with an accelerating and unpredictable trajectory. This threat will likely grow. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced this week that the virus is expected to impact the United States in a more severe way than it has to date.</p>\n<p>Traveling abroad – whether for study or leisure – carries a number of potential risks. Even a country not currently experiencing an outbreak could suddenly be declared a high-risk area, resulting in heightened exposure to the virus, difficulty with departure, immigration barriers in returning to the U.S., and even possible restrictions on returning to Grounds. The University strongly recommends not traveling to locations with CDC or State Department Level 3 alerts or higher. While we have not cancelled any current or existing study abroad programs, the University will cancel any such programs, even if already under way, at any location for which the CDC sets a warning level 3, or the State Department sets a warning level 3 or 4.</p>\n<p>The seasonal flu also is present in many areas. Basic measures remain the best defense against coronavirus, flu, and other communicable diseases:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with soapy water.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Cough and sneeze into a tissue or your elbow.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>TRAVEL PREPARATION</p>\n<p>The CDC maintains a travel information website for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>\n<p>for coronavirus (COVID-19). CDC Warning Level 3 is in effect for China and South Korea (as of Feb. 24).</p>\n<p>CDC Alert Level 2 is in effect for Iran, Italy, and Japan (as of Feb. 23).</p>\n<p>Be familiar with all aspects of the area you are visiting. The State Department’s website, studentsabroad.state.gov , offers planning tips, including links to local laws.</p>\n<p>, offers planning tips, including links to local laws. Enroll in the State Department’s STEP program and sign up for alerts for your destination(s).</p>\n<p>The CDC has recognized stigmatization may occur around coronavirus, and in response, has developed a webpage offering guidance on countering the stigma. Please help us prevent stigmatization by becoming familiar with the facts about COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The University continu</p>","id":"23764d00-da42-56a2-8bc9-4eb6b4258abe","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-virginia/2020-04-08-23_47_28/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Latest Updates on UVA’s Response to the Coronavirus"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://news.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/article_image/coronavirus_cdc_header_2.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Find the latest information on the University’s response to the coronavirus here.</p>\n<p>Below are archived communications that were distributed to the University community regarding the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>April 9: Message to Faculty From Provost Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Dear Members of the Faculty at UVA,</p>\n<p>Let me first express my hope that you and yours are safe and healthy during this difficult period, and, second, my appreciation for the exceptional work that you, along with all of our staff, are doing to continue our core missions as we grapple with this public health emergency.</p>\n<p>Throughout this challenging time, our actions have been guided by the desire to protect the health of our community (students, faculty, staff and Charlottesville neighbors), to help “flatten the curve,” and to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research and clinical care. Most recently, we adjusted our grading policy for this term (there will be an update sent to deans on the mechanics of this shortly), shifted our research enterprise to key functions only, and moved Summer Sessions 1 and 2 online.</p>\n<p>Today, I write to share that, given the extraordinary challenges we are facing with the COVID-19 emergency and the resulting disruption of regular teaching, research, clinical practice and service, the University is providing an across-the-board, one-year extension to the tenure clock for tenure-track faculty who meet certain eligibility criteria (details are here). Faculty may opt out of this automatic extension. We have adopted this provision for extension of the tenure clock pursuant to the Provost’s Promotion and Tenure Policy (PROV-017).</p>\n<p>The reason for this action is straightforward. Our faculty have had to reinvent their courses to be taught online and struggled to preserve research programs, with labs closed, conferences canceled and research assistants gone. Our UVA Health faculty have found themselves at the front line of this emergency as they are working to provide clinical care. The consequences of this pandemic are continuing to unfold and will be experienced differently across the University. This is a challenge for all faculty and staff, but particularly for our tenure-track faculty in their probationary period. Such tenure-seeking faculty have an ambitious set of expectations that they must meet within a short period, including demonstrated excellence in teaching, research/scholarship, clinical responsibilities; the development of a national reputation; and performance of University and professional service. While individual extensions of the tenure clock are permitted under University policy, given the current circumstances, we are extending the tenure clock across the board to support the success of our tenure-track faculty by compensating for the time lost due to the current crisis.</p>\n<p>Other faculty members who are experiencing disruption of their efforts to prepare for promotion or renewal due to the present public health emergency are encouraged to discuss this with their supervisor or dean. Members of our Academic General Faculty may have questions about their efforts to prepare for promotion or renewal, and those questions should be addressed to their school dean or associate dean. The schools retain flexibility to respond to such requests with provost approval, as described in our University-wide policy, linked here.</p>\n<p>Eligibility criteria and implementation details of the tenure clock extension are available, as noted above, here. We recognize that faculty may have questions regarding their individual cases. If so, please reach out to your department chair or dean, or you may write to vpfa@virginia.edu and we will follow up with you.</p>\n<p>I am grateful to each of you for the work you are doing in support of the University of Virginia. It is an honor and privilege to work with you.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost, University of Virginia</p>\n<p>April 7: Letter to Parents and Guardians</p>\n<p>Dear Parents and Guardians:</p>\n<p>These are hard times for everyone. As we experience a global pandemic that is expected to worsen in coming days in our area of the country, the University is joining with entities at the local, regional and state level to share resources that may be needed for the health and well-being of our fellow citizens.</p>\n<p>You and your student already are making personal sacrifices that none of us fully envisioned even a month ago. I’m writing today to thank you for all you are doing and to share more information about plans that will have an impact on a small contingent of students and their families. Although this does not affect all of you, I believe it’s important for all of our students and families to understand what – and why – certain decisions have been made in recent days.</p>\n<p>As a state institution with a public trust and mission, we have a duty to share our resources in times of crisis. Our facilities are owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia. It’s our good fortune that the UVA Hospital, a nationally renowned, level one trauma center, is part of our extended Grounds. We offer major resources that can help those suffering from COVID-19 and other illnesses, as well as assist the many doctors, nurses and staff members who are caring for them. Our resources are part of the bigger picture that emergency planners are reviewing to determine a comprehensive, joint response to aid the Central Virginia area.</p>\n<p>At the same time these plans are evolving, we must adhere to medical guidance and concerns for the safety and health of you, your families, our staff members and people in Charlottesville. Many of you have understandably wanted to return to the Grounds to pick up your students’ belongings if they lived in a residence hall. That simply is not possible given all the current concerns about the spread of COVID-19. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, but only when consistent with public health and safety.</p>\n<p>The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds. We are in contact with the some 250 undergraduate students who remain so they are aware of how to access services if they need help.</p>\n<p>Emergency Use of Bond, Bice, Shea, French and Spanish Houses. As part of the overall efforts addressing the COVID-19 crisis, the University recently was asked to provide housing in residence halls near the hospital. The buildings include Bice, Bond, Shea, and the French and Spanish houses. This weekend, eight students who had remained in those five buildings were relocated to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley, located on the opposite side of Grounds.</p>\n<p>As part of this process to answer the call of projected emergency needs, we now must carefully pack up and store all the possessions of students who had lived in those five buildings. The residents of those buildings received an email with details on Sunday and are being asked to complete a questionnaire to help direct the vendor we have retained for packing, moving and storage. A second email further clarifying the process was distributed yesterday. Students who received the questionnaire need to complete it by tomorrow, April 8, so the vendor can handle students’ possessions as carefully as possible and in accordance with their preferences.</p>\n<p>The University is covering the full cost of packing and storing items from these five buildings. Students only need to pay if they want to go to the storage warehouse and pick up their belongings before some point in the future when conditions are safer and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has lifted the stay-home order issued last week. Once a timeframe is set, the vendor will deliver everyone’s packed belongings to a central area of the Grounds where students and parents can pick them up. A range of dates and times for pick-up will be available.</p>\n<p>Governor Northam’s Executive Order. If you live in Virginia, then you know Gov. Northam issued an Executive Order last week directing Virginians to stay at home until June 10. This order, and previous guidance from the governor and other officials, has guided our decisions since mid-March about students returning to Grounds.</p>\n<p>The majority of our students are no longer in Charlottesville. A significant number, however, remain in off-Grounds apartments or houses. By and large, they are following social distancing guidelines and not gathering in groups larger than 10. I have seen exceptions, however, most notably on the UVA Lawn. Enjoying the beautiful spring weather is certainly not a problem, but if you think your student needs a reminder about not gathering in groups larger than 10, please help us out. It’s for their own safety and that of others. The asymptomatic spread of the novel coronavirus poses major concerns.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal Deadline Extended. For students only in the College of Arts &#x26; Sciences, the date to withdraw from the spring term has been changed to May 8 (it had previously been April 14). All College students now have until May 8 to withdraw from the spring 2020 term and return in fall 2020 (or summer). Students in the College have received a notification about this.</p>\n<p>Message from Dean Groves. All students received a message yesterday from University Dean of Students Allen Groves. He reminded students of the importance of social distancing and covered several other important topics, including the possibility of unemployment benefits for students who had part-time jobs and are now having difficulty paying rent or other major expenses. He also listed the many services available remotely, including the services of Student Health and Counseling &#x26; Psychological Services. I encourage you to read his message and ensure your student reads it.</p>\n<p>The University is committed to sharing updates with you as information is available, but we remain in a fluid situation marked by numerous uncertainties. Thank you for all you are doing to support your student as they finish this semester remotely. I hope you and your families are weathering this crisis as well as possible.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>April 6: Ryan Announces Emergency Fund to Assist Contract Workers, UVA Employees</p>\n<p>The following email was distributed to members of the University community on Monday:</p>\n<p>To the University community:</p>\n<p>I am writing to let you know about efforts we are making to support workers furloughed by our contractors and about a contribution to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation.</p>\n<p>A core aspiration of our strategic plan is to be a university that is both great and good. Toward that end, we have committed to doing our best to be a good neighbor and to live our values. That means, among other things, doing what we can to support our most vulnerable community members.</p>\n<p>We have kept our employees on our payroll, and we will continue to do so for as long as we can. Some of our contractors, including Aramark, have furloughed their employees. More may do so in the future. These workers are entitled to state and federal unemployment benefits, as well as some benefits being offered directly by their employers.</p>\n<p>It has become clear that these benefits are not flowing as quickly as any of us would like, and that our contract workers need immediate assistance. It is also clear that there may be a gap between the relief available from unemployment benefits and meeting the necessities of life. Our own employees may also be facing unexpected costs due to the crisis we are all facing.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we are devoting $2 million to create an emergency assistance fund for UVA contract workers and employees. We cannot provide a salary or wages to those who have been furloughed, because doing so would make them ineligible for the state and federal benefits that exist for those who are unemployed. But we can provide funding to help meet an array of needs related to the crisis. Our primary focus will be to help those who have been furloughed, but this fund will also be available for those still employed and facing unexpected costs.</p>\n<p>We will also be providing assistance to furloughed contract workers who need help in applying for state and federal unemployment benefits, and we expect this fund to be a helpful bridge to those who are awaiting benefits. We will keep this fund operational until June 1, and we will reassess at that point.</p>\n<p>We will have more details to share by mid-week, including a timeline and process for accessing the funds. A number of you have contacted me about helping out your colleagues, and I’m grateful for your interest and compassion. To facilitate that help, we are setting up a process for employees to donate directly to this fund.</p>\n<p>We are also committed to being a good neighbor to the Charlottesville region. For that reason, we are also contributing $1 million to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation to support their efforts to stabilize households during this pandemic. The Foundation has already raised over $2.3 million to support these efforts, and they are doing great work and deserve our support. For anyone who needs immediate assistance, please call their Community Resource Helpline at 434-234-4490.</p>\n<p>We will have more to say later this week about additional steps we are going to take to support our community, but I did not want to wait to get this information out. We face challenges ahead. We will only get through them by working together and doing what we can to support each other. Thanks for all of your efforts in that regard.</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>April 5: Update from the Dean of Students</p>\n<p>Dear Undergraduate, Graduate and Professional School Students:</p>\n<p>I’m writing today to offer updates on a few subjects, and also to check in on you. As April begins, it’s still somewhat difficult to fully grasp all that has occurred over the past few weeks. I imagine you are feeling a range of emotions. I hope as you deal with this upheaval in your life you will take some time for self-care and reflection. If you are spending major portions of your day in front of a computer instead of in a classroom or research lab or library with the friends, advisors, colleagues, and the routines you had come to enjoy, social isolation can be a real problem. Feelings of distance, loneliness, and even depression can result. Many of us feel a bit of “cabin fever” and that’s quite natural. Things as simple as taking a long walk and enjoying nature can help in dealing with the uncertainty everyone is feeling now.</p>\n<p>I urge you to stay connected with your friends and whoever else lifts your spirits. Prioritize your health, including getting adequate sleep, moving your muscles, and eating nutritiously. If you would like to speak with a counselor at any point, we continue to offer services through CAPS and Student Health remotely. Please see the end of this message for resources and contact information.</p>\n<p>If you are having difficulty with your courses, either because of the material, online delivery, or other issue, please reach out for help. If you are an undergraduate student, please call on your professor, teaching assistant, academic advisor, association dean (if in the College), or perhaps engage with a tutor or peer. Graduate and professional students should reach out to their professor, advisor, research director, department chair, or academic dean.</p>\n<p>• Governor Northam’s Executive Order. The warm spring weather can be a soothing antidote to stress, but it carries a risk as well. It remains very important to practice social distancing and abide by local directives. While it will be tempting to gather outside in groups, it is essential that you follow orders like those issued by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to maintain social distancing and only go out for essential needs. The Governor’s most recent Executive Order directs Virginians to stay at home through June 10. This does not preclude going out for a walk, for example, but if you go with a few friends, you should be mindful of keeping a distance of at least six feet between you. No groups of 10 or more can gather outside or elsewhere in Virginia, on public or private property. Many other states have similar restrictions aimed at “flattening the curve” and avoiding larger scale COVID-19 infections that may overwhelm our health care system.</p>\n<p>• Doing Our Part. We know the COVID-19 crisis is worsening in most of the country, including in Virginia. University leaders are responding by turning significant attention to our health system and standing ready to support the consolidated, joint efforts of emergency teams in the Charlottesville community and larger central Virginia area. As a state institution with a public trust and mission, it is our duty to respond to requests for use of our facilities and resources at the local, regional, state, and national levels.</p>\n<p>• Emergency Use of Residence Halls. Within the past few days, we have responded to requests from emergency planners to make residence hall space available near the UVA Hospital. The 15 undergraduate students who still resided in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses have been relocated this weekend, with help from the teams in Housing &#x26; Residence Life and Facilities Management, to vacant rooms in Lambeth and Copeley. Additionally, students who had been living in Bond, Bice, Shea, and the French and Spanish language houses – but had left Charlottesville previously – have been notified that the University will be carefully packing and storing their belongings at no cost to students, so the buildings can be used to support needs arising from this crisis. (Students can also choose to have their belongings shipped to them at their expense.)</p>\n<p>This crisis bears similarities to war efforts of the past when citizens had to make sacrifices and pull together for the greater good. I regret some decisions have come very quickly with little advance communication, but the situation is exceptionally fluid right now and the University is part of larger efforts with new priorities emerging daily. Whenever possible, we are committed to communicating with you in advance and as fully as possible. We will always endeavor not simply to tell you what action is being taken, but also why.</p>\n<p>• Retrieving Belongings from the Residence Halls. Given medical guidance and concerns for the health of you, your families, and people in Charlottesville, it will not be possible for students who were living in residence halls to come back to the Grounds at this time to retrieve personal possessions from on-Grounds residences. We will be determining a date and process for you to return in the future, and only when consistent with public health and safety. The residence halls currently are accessible only to those students who received permission to remain on Grounds.</p>\n<p>• Support for International Students. Of special note is that many of the undergraduate and graduate students remaining on Grounds and in our Charlottesville community are international students. We recognize the special challenges they face being far from home. We communicated last week with all students remaining on Grounds and emphasized how they can access needed services. For our international students in particular, we want to underscore our condemnation of, and resolve to combat, any acts of bias or xenophobia against them. If you have been the target of such an act, please report it through the University’s Just Report It system. Of course, if you believe you are ever in immediate danger, you should always call 911.</p>\n<p>• Financial Hardships. Without question, the coronavirus crisis is taking an economic toll on many, including our students, faculty and staff, and their families. The University is examining how costs and losses are affecting our operations. This includes the recognition that some families who have been hit especially hard may need to update their financial information with Student Financial Services for purposes of calculating institutional aid and access to other resources.</p>\n<p>Many students have expressed considerable concern about losing their wages from part-time jobs, affecting their ability to pay rent and other major expenses. Please note, the Student Legal Services office, which is staffed by attorney Lester Wilson and funded by the Student Activity Fee, may be a resource to assist you. More information is available on the Student Legal Services website.</p>\n<p>New federal legislation may also grant part-time student workers eligibility for unemployment benefits through the Virginia Employment Commission. Students who had part-time jobs, but are currently unemployed, can apply now on the VEC website. Applicants will need to renew their claims weekly, preferably Mondays through Wednesdays. The VEC website states VEC is still awaiting guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, so the timing of funding is uncertain. If you are a part-time student worker who lost your job in another state, you should apply using that state’s website to seek unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p>We are grateful to our graduate students for the support they continue to provide to the University’s core missions of teaching and research. For those students who are serving as Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs), the University’s policy on continuity of pay is noted on the Human Resources website. During the spring term, GTAs continue in their roles of working with faculty in teaching remotely for the remainder of the semester, while GRAs and research fellows continue to work with their faculty advisors and supervisors to engage in the activities of their research groups, including continuing research remotely to the extent possible. We know how disruptive this pandemic has been to the academic careers of our graduate students. The Provost and the Vice President for Research continue to work with the deans and faculty to find ways to ensure the success of our graduate students during this time of disruption in their education and research.</p>\n<p>Emergency funding continues to be available for all students in need. As a reminder, three forms of funding are available:</p>\n<p>• Final Exercises. Having walked the Lawn myself as a graduating student, I fully recognize the importance of walking the Lawn for our graduating students and their families. Last month, President Ryan asked Pam Higgins, Executive Director for Major Events in the President’s Office, and me to lead a working group of undergraduate and graduate students and representatives from the schools to recommend ways for a meaningful celebration still to occur on the Lawn. We hope to present recommendations soon to President Ryan and his senior leadership team. You should expect to hear directly from President Ryan on this topic in the coming weeks, as he is committed to seeing this through for you.</p>\n<p>• Providing Support. Many of you have expressed interest in supporting the University Health System and our local community, and we have seen many gestures of generosity. If you would like to learn more about how you can support the care needs of the Health System, please visit their website.</p>\n<p>With six weeks remaining in the semester, I hope to communicate several more times before everyone finishes the term. I personally want to stay connected with you, and I feel it is important for you to receive regular updates about important student topics and how the University is responding to the coronavirus crisis.</p>\n<p>I wish the best to each of you and your families.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Allen W.

But I realize many of you may be wondering about Governor Northam’s Executive Order, which was released this afternoon. So before I get to the summer programs, let me say a few words about the Governor’s Executive Order.</p>\n<p>The order requires all Virginia residents to remain at home, unless they are traveling to and from work or seeking essential services like medical care, food, or banking. Institutions of higher education, like UVA, “shall cease all in-person classes and instruction, and cancel all gatherings of more than ten individuals. For purposes of facilitating remote learning, performing critical research, or performing essential functions, institutions of higher education may continue to operate, provided that social distancing requirements are maintained.”</p>\n<p>This order is consistent with the decisions we have made over the last few weeks and will not change the way we are currently operating. If more changes become necessary, we will let you know.</p>\n<p>As far as this summer is concerned, in keeping with our decisions about this semester, we have decided to cancel all in-person summer programs through June 30th, 2020. “Summer programs” include classes, conferences, camps, and other events that are scheduled to occur on Grounds through June 30th.</p>\n<p>This means that classes offered during Summer Session 1 and 2 will move online. You can find more information about Summer Session at <a href=\"https://summer.virginia.edu/\">https://summer.virginia.edu/</a>. By June 1st, we will make a decision about in-person summer programs occurring after July 1st.</p>\n<p>As always, please visit <a href=\"https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus\">https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus</a> for the most up-to-date information on our response to COVID-19 and answers to frequently asked questions. I hope that you and yours are safe and healthy.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>March 23: Provost Clarifies the State of Research and Warns of Potential Shutdown</p>\n<p>Dear UVA Faculty and those involved in the research enterprise:</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience as we work together to tackle this fast-moving and complex public health crisis. We understand this has been a difficult period, including for those engaged in the important task of research, whether they do their work in a lab or in an office or in the field. As you know, last week, the University announced extraordinary measures to “flatten the curve” even as we work to continue our missions of teaching, research, and clinical care. The following day, the University announced that these measures apply to the research enterprise.</p>\n<p>This message follows up on this March 20 communication from our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian. I write to: i) provide two reminders; ii) to clarify the University’s approach to the engagement of graduate students in research during this period; and iii) to emphasize that all engaged in the research enterprise should be preparing for the possibility of a shutdown of ongoing research and resorting only to the maintenance of key laboratory assets.</p>\n<p>First, two reminders:</p>\n<p>I want to reaffirm the University position on research: As announced last week, the research enterprise should be shifting to key functions only – and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked here . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school.</p>\n<p>– and that task should be complete by tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, close of business. Our research enterprise is highly heterogenous, so what constitutes a “key” task will vary across the institution, but the already-announced guiding principles are linked . In addition, please consult your school and research dean for advice that is appropriate to the context of the research efforts in your school. In keeping with the University-wide approach to “flattening the curve”: All employees, including those engaged in the research enterprise, who can work from home, must work from home and their supervisor (here, PI) must require that they do so. Like all managers, a PI can “designate” a category of employees who must report in person to perform key functions. In keeping with efforts to “flatten the curve,” this category must be as small as possible to perform those tasks and the PI must assure that the safest practices are followed.</p>\n<p>Second, regarding the role of graduate students in the days ahead:</p>\n<p>As a matter of principle, the University position is that graduate students are – first and foremost – students . We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future.</p>\n<p>. We understand that in many research programs – conducted in a lab, from an office, or in the field – graduate students are essential to the research enterprise, and that work is part of graduate students’ own aspirations for their future. Given their status as students, the rule is this: a faculty member is not permitted to “designate” a graduate student, which would mean that the graduate student must report in person to perform key tasks. This rule is subject to narrow exceptions (decided through a process described below) if the PI/Research Leader and graduate student jointly request an exception.</p>\n<p>Exceptions : I will, after consulting with others (the relevant school dean, the VPR, and the EVPHA) determine whether an exception to this rule will be granted. Petitions to permit a graduate student to continue in-person work should be submitted by the PI and as the form indicates with the consent of the graduate student to the Provost’s Office by using this form.</p>\n<p>Third, it is critical that all PIs/Research Leaders plan for a shutdown of ongoing research. We do not know if or when that might occur; as has happened in some other states, it is possible that the decision will be required by a government order over which we have little control. Given this, it is crucial that researchers have a plan to preserve the vital material that is essential for research (for example, animals, cells, continuously run instruments and machines, special materials, and reagents). This task of preservation and planning will assure that, if we must pause our ongoing research, we will be positioned to return to this important endeavor whenever the pause is over. Believe me, all of us wish we could predict if and when we might have to shut down ongoing research; but we do not yet know. I assure you that we will continue to keep the UVA research community up to date in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and generosity of spirit during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 19: New Cases of COVID-19 Includes UVA Student</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University community on March 19:</p>\n<p>Dear University community:</p>\n<p>Earlier today the Virginia Department of Health confirmed three new cases of COVID-19 in the Charlottesville area.</p>\n<p>One of those cases is a UVA student who lives off Grounds in Albemarle County. The student, who is believed to have contracted the virus during recent international travel, is in isolation and receiving care following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish this student a speedy recovery during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort, with the assistance of University officials, to identify people who were in contact with this individual, reaching out to those individuals and arranging for their self-isolation, if necessary.</p>\n<p>The health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority. We realize a case of COVID-19 within our student body creates a heightened sense of anxiety and concern. The University coronavirus page offers a number of resources to help community members stay healthy and to cope with the strain this period is placing on all of us.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, as we work together to mitigate the spread of this disease, it is important that you continue to practice healthy habits:</p>\n<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</p>\n<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>\n<p>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</p>\n<p>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</p>\n<p>Additional information is available from the CDC.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, please respond to this email at covidinformation@virginia.edu or call 877-685-4836 (domestic) or 1-202-800-2408 (international).</p>\n<p>We have posted notification of this recent case on the UVA Coronavirus website. As a result of the expected spread of the coronavirus and the development of additional testing capacity, there will likely be additional cases in the coming days. We will not be emailing about each of them, but our default will be to post notifications of new cases to the coronavirus website and to email about new cases sparingly.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for your continued support and compassion during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Christopher P. Holstege, M.D.</p>\n<p>Department of Student Health &#x26; Wellness</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>March 18: Provost Outlines Undergraduate Grading Policy for Online Courses</p>\n<p>Dear UVA faculty, students, and staff:</p>\n<p>We are facing extraordinary challenges as a result of COVID-19. As the letter President Ryan and I shared yesterday made clear, this has required rapid and consequential decision making. In seeking to fulfill our academic mission, our guiding principles are clear: We will work to protect our University community and our neighbors, and we will do all we can to continue educating our students and pursuing our research. The effort to sustain our educational mission has required enormous effort and creativity by thousands of faculty and staff. As we launch tomorrow into our rapid transition from in-person to online instruction for the remainder of this semester, I am writing to provide direction on how we will handle grading for undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>For this semester, for our undergraduate schools, credit/no credit (CR/NC) will be the default grading system for all classes where the work is not yet completed; students will also, however, have the option to receive a letter grade. Students must decide whether to receive a letter grade by the last day of spring semester classes, Tuesday, April 28th. We will be in touch about the process for making that choice as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Several other details are important:</p>\n<p>Courses taken for CR/NC during Spring 2020 will count toward curricular, major, and graduation requirements. Such grades are not factored into a student’s GPA. Students who remain in the CR/NC option must complete the class with a grade of C or better to receive credit.</p>\n<p>This policy applies only to undergraduate level courses. The deans of the graduate and professional programs are considering how they will approach this question, and they will soon announce their decisions to their schools.</p>\n<p>UVA will include a designation on students’ transcripts to indicate that the CR/NC option was created in the midst of an extraordinary crisis and as part of the University’s effort to manage the transition to online instruction.</p>\n<p>These are not ordinary times. Every day, I am struck anew by the enormity of the challenges and the enormity of the effort being brought to bear to meet those challenges. As we resume the semester with online courses tomorrow, I want to thank all of you for your ingenuity, understanding, and patience. I remain confident in our collective ability to navigate this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 18: Provost Outlines Guidance for Maintaining Research Continuity</p>\n<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>\n<p>I write to provide an update on our approach to research, as promised in yesterday's University message. In consultation with President Ryan, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Craig Kent, and Vice President for Research Ram Ramasubramanian, the following principles are guiding our efforts on research. Research, like education, is central to the University's mission. Similar to our extraordinary effort to move classes online, we are taking dramatic steps to respond to this public health crisis while continuing our research mission.</p>\n<p>In keeping with, and directly quoting, yesterday’s message: “All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools, or UVA Health.” This directive applies to all University employees. Like managers across Grounds, Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers “have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.”</p>\n<p>We all remain grateful for your patience and partnership as we face these unprecedented times. In addition to the University’s coronavirus website, please visit the Vice President for Research website for specific resources and detailed guidance. Principal Investigators/Lead Researchers can find detailed research continuity guidelines here.</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>March 17: COVID-19 Causes Sweeping Changes to University Operations</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University Community on March 17:</p>\n<p>To the University community,</p>\n<p>We write with some important updates across a range of issues. As you know, this is an unprecedented and very rapidly changing situation, and all of us are learning more every day. At this point, it seems imperative that we do our very best to slow the progression of this virus in order to “flatten the curve” of those infected and avoid overwhelming our health system, which would ultimately risk our patients, our community, and our Charlottesville neighbors. This requires taking some significant, additional steps at this point.</p>\n<p>We realize and regret that these additional steps will cause more disappointment and call for more sacrifice, but we see no other way to do our part to help confront this public health crisis. We must also be mindful of the need of our students, their families, and our faculty and staff to plan, and we need to be mindful of protecting our faculty and staff, who make this place run. For all of those reasons, today we are announcing the following changes, including adjustments to classes, research, and events; guidance for employees; and modifications to services.</p>\n<p>These changes will go into effect immediately wherever possible, though we recognize that some may take a bit of time to implement fully, as explained more below.</p>\n<p>ADJUSTMENTS TO CLASSES, RESEARCH, AND EVENTS</p>\n<p>Classes will remain online throughout the semester. It is exceedingly unlikely, based on all that we know at this point, that this virus will have abated by the end of April. In light of the need for faculty, staff, and students to make plans, we are making the decision now – rather than waiting until April 5 – to not hold any classes on Grounds this semester. For students who do not have the technology needed to complete their classes online, please visit our technology support fund page and read the instructions and guidelines completely. We are in active discussions about what changes we might make to our normal grading system this semester. We will be back in touch soon, once we have made a decision.</p>\n<p>Final Exercises will not proceed as planned. In light of the evidence about the likely progression of the virus over the next couple of months, and when it will peak, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Final Exercises as currently planned. We did not make this decision lightly, as we know how disappointing it will be to graduating students and their families. That said, a team is already focused on developing creative alternatives to mark this important occasion, and we will communicate updates as we have them.</p>\n<p>All events on Grounds are cancelled, no matter the size, until at least May 15. We had originally cancelled events over 100, but on Sunday the CDC suggested no groups larger than 50, and just recently the White House and the Governor of Virginia suggested gatherings of no more than 10 people. Rather than continue to chase the ever-shrinking size limitations, we want to be clear that all events should be cancelled this semester. These restrictions include events that are not University-sponsored, but are planned to occur on Grounds, including conferences, symposia, and social gatherings. This does not preclude small internal meetings, where social distancing should be the touchstone.</p>\n<p>Research. Like our teaching mission, we are committed to continuing our research mission while making sure we take steps to keep members of our community safe. We will provide guidance on this by mid-day tomorrow, Wednesday, March 18.</p>\n<p>GUIDANCE FOR EMPLOYEES</p>\n<p>All faculty and staff who can work remotely should be told to do so. We are mandating telecommuting for all faculty and staff except those who must report in person to carry out key functions for their units, schools or UVA Health. The latter includes, among others, faculty who need to come to their classrooms or offices to teach online, and UVA Health faculty and staff who need to care for patients and support patient services. The traditional categories of “designated” and “non-designated” are helpful but not entirely relevant here, given that those categories envisioned short delays due to weather problems. School leaders, unit supervisors, and managers have the authority to identify those who must report and those who can work remotely and should share direct guidance with their faculty and staff. We understand that some staff may need to consult with their managers to better understand how to conduct their work under the changed circumstances, and some may need to return to Grounds to collect items necessary to work remotely. We expect these plans to be fully implemented no later than the end of the day, Friday, March 20.</p>\n<p>Employee Compensation and Benefits. We are committed to our employees. We are determined to ensure that the modifications to our operations caused by the coronavirus will not impact our existing commitments to compensate and continue existing benefits for UVA employees, whether part time or full time. We will, therefore, honor all existing commitments for the foreseeable future. The length of this crisis is difficult to predict at this point, as are the economic ramifications. There may come a point where we need to reassess in light of the length of time of the crisis or significantly changes circumstances, but our hope and plan is to weather this crisis together.</p>\n<p>To be clear, those who must report for work will have to do so. Those who can work remotely will have to do so. Those who fall into neither category may be asked to perform other functions for their units or schools or to take on tasks elsewhere at the University. Whether or not these employees are able to be re-deployed, we will honor existing employment commitments for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Contract Employees. We have relationships with a wide range of contractors across the University, which present a variety of situations. We are in active conversations with these contractors and hope to be able to provide an update fairly soon.</p>\n<p>Student Employees. This change in operations will have an impact on our student employees as well. Students who are teaching assistants or working on research will continue to be paid if they continue their work. Student employees who are able to complete their duties remotely can do so with the approval of their supervisor. Students should submit timesheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage. Student in the Federal Work Study program (FWS) will continue to be paid an average of their current wages bi-weekly through the end of the semester. Students on FWS who will continue to work remotely should submit time sheets and be paid at their normal hourly wage.</p>\n<p>For the safety of students and the others with whom they may come into contact, non FWS student employees who cannot work remotely will not be eligible to continue working while the University’s operating schedule is modified due to COVID-19. We understand that this will cause some students financial hardship, and we will do whatever we can to help. If you are in need of financial support, please connect with your supervisor, who has received a list of emergency financial resources available to displaced student employees.</p>\n<p>MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICES; CREDITS OR REFUNDS FOR HOUSING AND DINING</p>\n<p>On-Grounds Housing Will Be Further Restricted. As our resources and on-site staffing levels diminish due to social distancing directives, and due to increasing emphasis on the importance of social distancing, we will only be able to provide on-Grounds Housing for a very limited number of residents. Only students who have no other option will be permitted to remain on-Grounds. As a reminder, students who are returning solely to collect some of their belongings still have until Wednesday, March 18 at noon to do so. If you are not able to collect your belongings before then, please do not return to Grounds until you hear from us with guidance, which will be coming soon. We will provide details about when and how students will be able to gather all of their belongings.</p>\n<p>Any students who stayed in on-Grounds Housing following our initial request to return home must make plans to leave by Friday, March 20 unless they meet one of the following criteria: 1) international students who are unable to secure travel to return home; 2) persons for whom their on-Grounds residence is their only home (including graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff for whom their on-Grounds residence is their permanent address); or 3) students for whom traveling home would present a severe health or safety risk. Housing &#x26; Residence Life will contact students who completed the original survey to remain on Grounds, and work with them to transition back home. As before, students currently receiving financial aid with questions related to financial resources for departing Grounds should contact UVA Student Financial Services at sfs@virginia.edu or 434.982.6000.</p>\n<p>We are urging undergraduate and graduate students who live off-Grounds to follow these guidelines as well .</p>\n<p>Dining</p>\n<p>Dining options will be very limited. Effective immediately, Observatory Hill Dining Hall will serve as the only major dining facility in service, apart from those necessary to support UVA Health. Those using O-Hill can obtain their meals there but will not be able to eat inside the facility. Please visit the University’s Dining website for hours of operation and real-time updates. Wherever possible, we encourage students who have kitchens in their place of residence to prepare their own meals.</p>\n<p>Credits or Refunds for Housing and Dining</p>\n<p>We will provide pro-rated credits to student accounts for on-Grounds Housing and UVA dining contracts. We will send additional information on the mechanics of this process in a later communication, but students will have the ability to either request a refund or allow the credit to remain on their student account to apply to future bills. As long as students remain enrolled through the end of the spring semester, financial aid will not be impacted.</p>\n<p>We are making a number of modifications to various services. Dining services, as described above, will be limited to take out/grab and go only. All libraries will be closed, except to faculty and staff who need to use them for teaching online classes or clinical care. Student activity spaces, like those in Newcomb Hall, 1515, and the Student Activities Building, will be closed. All gyms and fitness facilities on Grounds will be closed. University venues such as the museums, the McCormick Observatory, and the Rotunda will be closed to the public. Bus service will be reduced. More details will be forthcoming with respect to all of these topics and will be posted on the University’s coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>This message covers sweeping changes that would usually be made only after months of consideration and discussion. In the face of this rapidly evolving public health crisis, however, we have been called to make the best decisions we can in a limited amount of time in order to look out for the health and safety of our community, both at the University and in the surrounding Charlottesville region. Implementing these changes will no doubt be difficult, and we know further questions will arise, but we remain as confident as ever in our community’s ability to navigate this unprecedented set of challenges together. In the meantime, our profound thanks to everyone in this community for your dedication, creativity, and compassion.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Liz Magill</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>March 17: UVA Outlines Child Care Options for Employees</p>\n<p>Dear UVA Health Community:</p>\n<p>To address the extensive caregiving needs created by the K-12 school closure, the University has expanded our caregiving support network. These services are either subsidized or fully reimbursed. For details and directions on how to register, visit the HR Caregiving Website.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bright Horizons Back-up Care</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Care is provided either at a licensed care facility or in-home by care providers who have been screened, trained and background-checked. It is strongly recommended you sign up to be eligible in advance of needing care.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Bright Horizons Crisis Care Assist</li>\n</ol>\n<p>UVA team members enrolled in the Bright Horizons Back-up Care program (above) also have the option to source their own child and/or elder care and receive reimbursement through the Crisis Care Assist program.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Sittercity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>UVA now has a new partnership with Sittercity.com to match team members who are unable to source their own care with professional caregivers.</p>\n<p>Call for Caregivers!</p>\n<p>Due to high demand of caregivers needed for child/elder care, we are asking anyone who is available to provide care to please register as a caregiver in this time of need. For more details and to register, please see the HR Caregiving Website.</p>\n<p>We understand the tremendous impact school closure is having on you and your families, therefore, we continue to explore more services to help deal with this burden.</p>\n<p>Kelley Stuck</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer</p>\n<p>Josh Christian</p>\n<p>Senior Director HR - UVA Health</p>\n<p>March 17: Update on University’s Telecommuting Policy</p>\n<p>Dear colleagues,</p>\n<p>Yesterday Governor Northam announced that all K-12 schools in Virginia will be closed for a minimum of two weeks, beginning on Monday, March 16th. At this point, some of you are probably trying to figure out how to support your family and your career while schools are closed, which is one of the reasons I’d like to share a brief reminder of our telecommuting policy.</p>\n<p>To begin, while most students are gone and online instruction will begin on Thursday, UVA remains open and operating – meaning faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. That said, our telecommuting policy is designed to give employees the flexibility to work remotely when necessary and possible.</p>\n<p>If you need to work remotely, please talk to your manager. I realize it may be difficult to take care of your families and work remotely at the same time, which is why I encourage flexibility and creativity from both employees and managers. I would also ask that managers please give your employees the option to work remotely – provided you are still able to keep your units open for business.

The individual who is ill, a staff member at the UVA Women’s Center who lives off Grounds, is receiving care and in quarantine at home following protocols from the Virginia Department of Health. We wish her a speedy and full recovery.</p>\n<p>The Virginia Department of Health is leading the effort to identify individuals who were in contact with the staff member, reaching out to those individuals, and arranging for their isolation. University staff are also working to support potentially impacted students, faculty and staff. In addition, the UVA Women’s Center is being vacated and deep-cleaned with products that kill the coronavirus in accordance with CDC guidelines.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. If you exhibit these symptoms, please contact your health care provider and follow their instructions before leaving your home and potentially putting others at risk:</p>\n<p>Students: Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.</p>\n<p>Contact Student Health 434-982-3915, or 434-297-4261 after hours.

At this point, some of you are probably trying to figure out how to support your family and your career while schools are closed, which is one of the reasons I’d like to share a brief reminder of our telecommuting policy.</p>\n<p>To begin, while most students are gone and online instruction will begin on Thursday, UVA remains open and operating—meaning faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. That said, our telecommuting policy is designed to give employees the flexibility to work remotely when necessary and possible.</p>\n<p>If you need to work remotely, please talk to your manager. I realize it may be difficult to take care of your families and work remotely at the same time, which is why I encourage flexibility and creativity from both employees and managers. I would also ask that managers please give your employees the option to work remotely—provided you are still able to keep your units open for business. As a reminder, any employee who is ill should go home immediately and seek appropriate medical attention.</p>\n<p>As we announced yesterday, two weeks of additional paid leave (Public Health Emergency Leave) is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member diagnosed with the disease. This leave, however, cannot be used for childcare.</p>\n<p>Employees who must stay home to care for children while schools are closed and can’t work remotely should use University Time Off (University Staff) or the equivalent for classified staff. We offer benefits to assist with care for benefits-eligible employees who need temporary care and are looking into options for providing additional care options.</p>\n<p>We will notify you if we need to make any changes to our telecommuting policy and will post any new information in the Working Remotely section of the University’s Coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for everything you are doing for UVA—every day, and especially over the last few weeks. We could not do any of this without you, and I am profoundly grateful. Lastly, updates on the coronavirus generally and our response to it will be posted regularly on our coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Kelley Stuck</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer</p>\n<p>March 13: Students Urged to Return Home; UVA Can Assist With Moving Out</p>\n<p>The following message was distributed to University of Virginia students March 13 by Dean of Students Allen Groves:</p>\n<p>Dear Students:</p>\n<p>Much has occurred in the past week since your Spring Break began. I realize you have been receiving a great many messages from the University this week, so I am going to highlight my most important points up front. First, if you can return to your home, we need you to do so as soon as possible. Second, if you are away from Grounds and only need a few essential belongings, we can help.</p>\n<p>Now, the details:</p>\n<p>If you live on Grounds: With your permission, we can arrange for a staff person to go to your room, retrieve essential items you need, and ship them to you. You also are welcome to have a friend do this. To make arrangements for either, please contact housing@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>If you live off Grounds: We have enlisted the help of primary landlords in the area. If you need items from your home or apartment, please call your landlord for help with this or other critical matters. We also hope those of you residing in fraternity and sorority houses will return home. We have been in contact with alumni house corporation officers to seek their (and your) cooperation. If you have friends still in town, please consider asking for their help in collecting your belongings before they leave.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, some leases require that you let your landlord know, in writing, if you will be gone for a week or more. Please check your lease and make sure you follow these and other instructions. If you don't have a copy of your lease, ask your landlord to email it to you.</p>\n<p>It is very important that you return home and be ready to start virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We know some of you will need to stay due to unavoidable circumstances, but otherwise, you should be returning home right away. If you need to return to collect your belongings from your apartment or residence hall, please make every effort to make your trip as brief as possible. We are facing a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. You are risking not only your own health if you continue to gather in groups and circulate in the area, but also – of critical importance – you are risking the health of others in our community who are likely to be more affected by this disease.</p>\n<p>International students and those living a great distance from Grounds: If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.</p>\n<p>Student Workers: Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work. This flexibility applies to students who started classes this spring and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place. The employment of other student workers is under discussion by University leadership, but nothing has been determined at this point.</p>\n<p>Financial concerns: The University is committed to assisting students in need during this unprecedented time. If you are currently receiving financial aid and have questions about resources for leaving Grounds and returning home, please contact UVA Student Financial Services through a special website for Emergency Travel Assistance.</p>\n<p>Online resources: We recognize what an abrupt and challenging transition it will be to shift to virtual classes. Faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and you will have support from the University. You will be able to link to resources through the coronavirus website.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all the steps you are taking to help us respond to this health crisis. This is an unprecedented situation in our lifetimes, and I respectfully ask each of you to do the responsible thing as citizens in a larger community. Your willingness to comply with what is being asked of you will help the broader community – including many at-risk individuals – minimize the impact of this crisis as much as possible. Unlike some crises we witness from afar, this is one where we can each take action that has a tangible result. Individual actions will make a huge difference in how we face and eventually spring back from this difficult challenge. In this case, a selfless decision on your part may save a life.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Allen W. Groves</p>\n<p>University Dean of Students</p>\n<p>March 13: Message Urges Parents to Help Ensure Students Return Home</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered on March 13 to UVA parents and guardians of students:</p>\n<p>Dear Parents and Guardians:</p>\n<p>I am writing to you as someone who cares deeply about your students' safety, health, and well-being. We are facing a public health crisis worldwide, nationwide, and here in Virginia.</p>\n<p>On behalf of the University and larger Charlottesville community, I am appealing to you if your student has told you they want to remain here: We need your help ensuring your student returns home and is ready to begin virtual classes on Thursday, March 19. We recognize a small number of students cannot leave due to unavoidable circumstances, and we will continue to support those students, but we need all other students to return home for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>We are especially concerned right now about students living off Grounds. Last night, a number of students were celebrating on the Corner, and a rumor is circulating about more gatherings this evening. We need your assistance in helping them understand the dangers posed by COVID-19. While they may not become sick or may suffer only mild symptoms, they could potentially infect residents in the local community who could contract the disease and become acutely ill.</p>\n<p>We made the very difficult decision to move our classes to virtual instruction not only based on the health and welfare of our students, but also because we want to ensure that the UVA Health System, a Level 1 trauma center, is not stretched too thin in the coming weeks and months. We believe the fewer students in Charlottesville right now, the better for our health system and, thus, for the health and welfare of everyone in the region.</p>\n<p>Mitigating this crisis must be a community-wide effort, and we have enlisted the help of the area's primary landlords, asking them to reiterate these concerns to their student-tenants. Yesterday, we engaged alumni who manage Greek housing, asking their help as well. If your student lives off Grounds and needs individual help with matters like retrieving their most important belongings, they should contact their landlord directly. If your student encounters difficulty after contacting their landlord, please have them email the Office of the Dean of Students at odos@virginia.edu for assistance.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if your student lives on Grounds and they need a few essential things from their room, they can have a friend pick up the items or arrange for a staff member to enter their room to get the items and ship them. For help with this – only if your student lives in on-Grounds housing – please email housing@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>Your student will be hearing more from the University soon about the transition to virtual classes. We know this will be an abrupt and challenging transition, but faculty and staff across the University are working hard to make the shift as smooth as possible, and your student will have support from the University. In addition, Allen Groves, University Dean of Students, will be communicating soon with your student to further clarify a variety of questions that have arisen.</p>\n<p>Thank you to each of you for your help and support. I know there are many whose student is already at home or planning to be at home soon. We are grateful for your partnership and quick action.</p>\n<p>In my 40 years at the University, I have faced many crises, yet none like this. Most of our students have no memory of September 11. This, however, is a global pandemic previously unseen by any of us. We must help them understand how vital it is to unite around this crisis. The COVID-19 health crisis is forcing each of us to make sacrifices and changes none of us wants to make. In the end, however, it is not about us. It’s about our responsibility to our fellow human beings. Thank you for all you and your student are doing during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Finally, please continue to check our coronavirus website, which is being updated continually with new information. If you have questions, please call our Response Lines at 877-685-4836: domestic; 1-202-800-2408: international; or email covidinformation@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Patricia M. Lampkin</p>\n<p>Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer</p>\n<p>March 12: More details about COVID-19 changes</p>\n<p>Dear members of the UVA Community:</p>\n<p>I write to provide a few updates following President Ryan’s email from yesterday about the steps the University is taking in response to the COVID-19 threat. If you have not yet done so, I encourage you to read his message closely.</p>\n<p>To review, President Ryan announced a series of actions yesterday—gearing up to deliver classes on-line as of March 19th, strongly encouraging students to return home if they can, and prohibiting certain events on Grounds. These actions are all guided by the the desire (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. We can advance all of those goals by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds.</p>\n<p>Today we are providing additional updates and announcing several additional changes, some of which are relevant to the entire community, and some of which are specific to faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>First, the more general updates:</p>\n<p>We will be making a decision about Final Exercises by April 15th.</p>\n<p>We know this is top of mind for many of you, especially graduating students, and we are working as fast as we can to give you some clarity – understanding that we don’t yet know what the situation will look like in May.</p>\n<p>Events at John Paul Jones Arena are postponed at least through the weekend.</p>\n<p>Please visit www.johnpauljonesarena.com for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster.</p>\n<p>for the latest on each event. Ticket holders will be notified through Ticketmaster. We will continue to work with performers and others involved in events scheduled to take place at John Paul Jones arena to evaluate additional upcoming events.</p>\n<p>The ACC has suspended the Spring Athletics season.</p>\n<p>Earlier today, the ACC announced that they have suspended all athletic related activities. This means that all Spring sports at UVA are canceled.</p>\n<p>Fans who have already purchased tickets may contact the Virginia Athletics Ticket Office by phone at 800-542-8821 or by email at uvatickets@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>We are looking into offseting dining and housing costs for students.</p>\n<p>We have set up a Financial Resource Working Group that is looking into, among other things, offsetting dining and housing costs for students. More details will follow soon.</p>\n<p>We also have a Student Life and Leadership fund, which is a rainy day fund distributed by the Student Affairs Office for students with unexpected expenses.</p>\n<p>Students who are part of the Federal Work Study program will continue to be paid even if they are not able to work.</p>\n<p>This flexibility applies to students who started classes for the Spring 2020 term and earned FWS wages prior to the University moving to virtual instruction. It will remain in effect as long as virtual instruction remains in place.</p>\n<p>If we resume in-person classes before the end of the semester, we will make sure any student who has gone home and cannot return to Grounds is able to complete the term.</p>\n<p>Early this morning, the University suspended all of its current study-abroad programs, and encouraged all UVA students to return to the United States by this weekend. The International Studies Office contacted participants in these programs individually.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Below are more specific updates for faculty, staff, and graduate students working on Grounds.</p>\n<p>Let me start by acknowledging how difficult this situation is for all members of our University community and express the leadership’s deep gratitude for your hard work and your dedication to UVA’s missions.</p>\n<p>The University is open and operating.</p>\n<p>Given normal operations, faculty and staff should continue to report to work as usual (you can find more detail on our human resources policies below).</p>\n<p>We will begin scaling back some services, like dining and bus service, but will still meet the needs of employees and the limited number of students who will be remaining on Grounds. Any changes in these services will be posted on the Operations Status Board , and details will be available on departmental websites.</p>\n<p>, and details will be available on departmental websites. Libraries will remain open from 8am to 5pm daily, with the possible exception of weekends. Some locations that depend heavily on student workers may close.</p>\n<p>We are monitoring this rapidly evolving situation closely. A cross-university team, including medical professionals, meets daily. If any modification to the University’s operating schedule becomes necessary, we will let you know immediately.</p>\n<p>Human Resources: All faculty and staff should continue reporting to work, but employees will be eligible for a new leave benefit.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff should plan to report to work as usual. However, when possible, we do encourage managers to consider options for staff and faculty to work from home. You can find answers to questions about working remotely here .</p>\n<p>. If you have an underlying health condition that necessitates working from home, please talk to your manager, department chair, or dean. They, in turn, are encouraged to be flexible if an employee has a compromised health situation or is caring for someone who does.</p>\n<p>As of today, all employees, including wage and temporary employees, are eligible for up to two weeks of leave if they have been impacted by the virus. This includes employees in both the Academic Division and Medical Center.</p>\n<p>This leave is available to employees who have been directed to self-quarantine by a qualified health care provider, have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or have an immediate family member who diagnosed with the disease. More details on this new policy can be found here or you can contact the or contact the HR Solution Center at AskHR@virginia.edu or 434-243-3344.</p>\n<p>Teaching continuity: We are working to support faculty as classes move online.</p>\n<p>We have an all-hands-on-deck approach to bringing our teaching on line. Below are updates on some of the key developments from the cross-university team that is working on this.</p>\n<p>We sent out a survey to faculty and instructors yesterday to determine the support needed to move classes online and we have a plan in place to provide support – either centrally or through schools. If you received the survey and have not responded, please respond immediately. The responses to the survey will be critical to understanding the needs and responding to them.</p>\n<p>You can find general information on teaching continuity here . More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found here .</p>\n<p>. More specific answers about academic instruction related to yesterday’s announcement can be found . We are working to identify and support any students who might have connectivity or other assistance needs in accessing online instruction. As a reminder, while online classes will begin on March 19th, there will be no in-person classes between now and March 19th. That is, we are taking a pause in classes. Given that this is only 3 days (similar to snow days in the past), we are confident that we will complete the term with the teaching days available.</p>\n<p>Research continuity: We have plans in place to ensure research can continue.</p>\n<p>Faculty, staff, and postdocs engaged in research are permitted to continue that research. Principle Investigators can designate some of their laboratory staff and postdocs as essential to the continuity of their research.</p>\n<p>Graduate students whose research takes place in the University’s labs will continue to have access to those facilities in consultation with their faculty advisors. Graduate students with appointments as research assistants should be in touch with their faculty advisors to learn about any changes to the activities of their research group.</p>\n<p>We do not know how disruptive this virus will be and encourage anyone conducting research to begin planning for what to do if that research gets disrupted. We have created a research continuity website with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan.</p>\n<p>with information on how services might be affected and recommendations for how to plan. All PIs with an active open research grant have been reached individually. There will be additional guidance for social and behavioral sciences, as well as for patient care-based clinical trials, shortly.</p>\n<p>We are suspending all international and non-essential domestic University travel, effective immediately and continuing at least through April 15th.</p>\n<p>International Travel for University business</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, we are prohibiting all University-related international travel by faculty and staff. If you require an exception, please submit a request to the Provost’s office at COVIDTravel@virginia.edu. Requests will require an endorsement of the employee’s dean, vice president, vice provost, or manager.</p>\n<p>Domestic Travel for University business</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, we are suspending all non-essential domestic travel. Essential travel is defined as supporting activities that are absolutely necessary, cannot be rescheduled, and must be done in person. If a supervisor, associate dean, or dean deems the travel essential, it will be reimbursed. If not, it will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Return from international travel</p>\n<p>If you do travel internationally, it is important to note that return may be difficult. As a result of the U.S. Presidential Proclamation on March 11 th , University faculty and staff who have been in Europe’s Schengen area (26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted travel between them) in the previous 14 days before re-entry to the United States will face enhanced screening procedures for returning to the U.S. Please consult the Center for Disease Control for details.</p>\n<p>, University faculty and staff who have been in Europe’s (26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted travel between them) in the previous 14 days before re-entry to the United States will face enhanced screening procedures for returning to the U.S. Please consult the for details. University faculty and staff who are not American citizens or legal permanent residents of the United States who have been in the Schengen area in the previous 14 days may not travel to the United States, even with currently valid nonimmigrant visas, for the 30 day period beginning at midnight, March 13th. We are currently exploring whether the U.S. government may change this policy, and will share more information as we get it.</p>\n<p>Return from personal travel</p>\n<p>We ask all University employees to take account of this guidance as they evaluate their own personal travel. Check the state and territorial health department websites for the latest information.</p>\n<p>Reimbursement</p>\n<p>If you must cancel travel, seek waivers and refunds directly from the airlines and hotels first.

If you have a question that isn’t covered on either of these sites, contact the travel team at travel@virginia.edu or 434-924-4121</p>\n<p>Event restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>To re-emphasize, President Ryan’s message yesterday announced two policies about University-sponsored events: 1) we have suspended all university-sponsored events that involve more than 100 people and; 2) for events that involve fewer than 100 people, we strongly recommend alternatives to having an in-person event and, if that is not possible, taking all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of infection. We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.</p>\n<p>Deans, vice presidents, vice provosts, or unit heads (or their designees) will apply these rules. Any leader with questions about a specific event should direct those questions to the Office of Major Events at uvaome@virginia.edu.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I want to thank all of you again for your patience and understanding. We will continue to share as much information as possible as soon as we can, and we will do our best to answer any questions that may come up. Please continue to visit the University’s Novel Coronavirus website, which is updated regularly and provides answers to many frequently asked questions.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>March 11: University Moves All Courses Online, Urges Students to Return Home</p>\n<p>To the University community,</p>\n<p>I write to share an update on our response to the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, and our plans for the remainder of the Spring semester.</p>\n<p>To begin with the basic and important news:</p>\n<p>We will be moving our classes online. We will not be holding classes on Grounds for the foreseeable future, quite possibly through the end of the semester. We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date.</p>\n<p>We will reassess after April 5th at the earliest and periodically after that date. Online classes will begin Thursday, March 19.</p>\n<p>Students who are away on Spring Break are strongly encouraged to return home or to remain home if they are already there.</p>\n<p>Students on Grounds and in Charlottesville are strongly encouraged to return home by this weekend .</p>\n<p>. University events with more than 100 people are prohibited for the foreseeable future and should be postponed, cancelled, or offered virtually.</p>\n<p>These are obviously significant steps that will cause disruption and disappointment, which we all regret. We nonetheless feel compelled to take these steps in light of the most recent evidence. The virus continues to spread nationally and in Virginia. We still do not yet have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, so our risk remains relatively low. Given that fact, the easiest and least disruptive option would have been to bring all students back to Grounds as planned and hope to make it through the rest of the semester without a confirmed case. We also considered bringing students back and moving only large classes online.</p>\n<p>After talking more with medical experts, however, and as the evidence of the spread here and abroad mounts, we believe that these approaches would not be sufficient and would create too much risk, especially for our health system and the medical center, which is a Level 1 trauma center and may be stretched to the limits in the coming weeks and months. Experts have also told us that the best time to take steps to prevent that spread is now, before the first case arrives.</p>\n<p>Our approach here is guided by three goals: (1) to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville neighbors; (2) to help slow the spread of the virus in Virginia and the nation; (3) to ensure the continuity of our teaching, research, and clinical care. All of those goals are advanced by reducing the number of people who are living and meeting on Grounds. We cannot eliminate all risks, of course, but we believe at this time these steps will help mitigate the risks we face.</p>\n<p>To be clear, the University – including university buildings and UVA Health – will remain open, and we will bring students back to Grounds as soon as we can do so safely. While we hope to do so before the end of the semester, we may not be able to and are working on a number of contingency plans, including plans for graduation.</p>\n<p>A few notes for specific groups:</p>\n<p>Students</p>\n<p>If you are currently away on Spring Break, we strongly encourage you to stay home or return to your home . Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>. Those who need to return briefly to collect crucial belongings, such as computers or books, will be permitted to do so, and details about how to do so will be forthcoming. If you are currently in Charlottesville, we strongly encourage you to return home .</p>\n<p>This strong request applies to all students regardless of where you are living – whether on Grounds or off.</p>\n<p>whether on Grounds or off. We recognize that some students cannot go home, for a variety of reasons, ranging from the fact that their hometowns or countries are not safe to the fact that their only homes are in Charlottesville. We will continue to provide housing for students living on Grounds who genuinely cannot return home, and we will continue to provide dining services, though they will be modified. We will also offer assistance to students on financial aid who need help in returning to their homes.</p>\n<p>With the help and creativity of faculty and staff, we will make sure you are able to meet your academic requirements remotely, and we will pay special attention to graduating students. You will be hearing from deans and professors over the next week with details about your classes, including any clinical, experiential, performance-based, or studio learning that may require alternative arrangements.</p>\n<p>Faculty</p>\n<p>All faculty will be hearing from their deans soon with more details about moving classes online.</p>\n<p>We are standing up a team to provide the necessary training and technology to move courses online.</p>\n<p>While some research will be put on hold, we have plans in place to allow core research operations to continue. Those of you who are conducting research will be hearing from our Provost, Liz Magill, and our Vice President for Research, Ram Ramasubramanian, with more details soon.</p>\n<p>Staff</p>\n<p>For the time being, staff should continue reporting to work as usual and take the recommended steps to prevent illness. A full list can be found here .</p>\n<p>. Staff with questions or concerns about their workplaces and the possibility of telecommuting should speak with their supervisors. We ask that staff who are feeling sick to please remain at home.</p>\n<p>Events</p>\n<p>Effective immediately and until further notice, we are suspending all university-sponsored events that involve more than 100 people.</p>\n<p>For events that involve fewer than 100 people, we strongly recommend alternatives to having an in-person event and, if that is not possible, taking all necessary precautions to mitigate the risk of infection. We also ask that those hosting events that involve visitors traveling to Grounds, of whatever size, consider alternatives or cancelling those events, depending on the risks involved.</p>\n<p>At this time, these restrictions do not apply to athletic events or events at JPJ, both of which remain under discussion and consideration.</p>\n<p>We realize you will likely have questions, both about this decision and about COVID-19 in general. Starting today, you can go to this website for more information, and we have set up a call center (Domestic: 877-685-4836; International: +1 202-800-2408) with staff trained to answer the most common questions. We will also be sending out more detailed communications about various elements of this plan, which we will also post on the website. As this is an evolving situation, we will also provide updates if there are significant changes to the plan outlined in this email.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank the teams from across the University who have been working incredibly hard over the last few weeks, and who will keep working hard to make this transition as smooth as possible. I am deeply grateful that UVA is home to so many expert, capable people who are dedicated to the well-being of our community and to our critical missions of teaching, research, and clinical care.</p>\n<p>I would also like to thank all of you for your patience and understanding. Put simply, UVA has never encountered something quite like this. There is no roadmap for trying to put most of the University curriculum online in a week. But I have enormous faith in this community – in your resilience, your willingness to do your part to keep others safe, and your ability to make the most of a very difficult situation.</p>\n<p>I have special faith in our students, for whom the health risks are generally low and for whom the disappointments are high, but who I know will recognize that now is the time to think first of the well-being of others.</p>\n<p>We are in this together, though I recognize that the impact will be uneven. As the father of a graduating senior at another university who has been asked to return home, I know this decision will hit our fourth-year students especially hard. It will also create economic challenges and hardships for some in the Charlottesville community whose livelihoods depend on our students. We will make it through this together by supporting each other, thinking creatively, and staying connected even if physically separated. I cannot pretend, obviously, that this is how I hoped this semester would unfold. No one can. But I eagerly await the ingenuity, compassion, and kindness that this common challenge will surely unlock within our community. If there were ever a time to be both great and good, this is surely it.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Jim</p>\n<hr>\n<p>James E. Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>March 8: Coronavirus Updates on University Preparedness, Travel, and Operations</p>\n<p>The following message was delivered to the University community on March 8.</p>\n<p>Dear members of the University community:</p>\n<p>Like all of you, I am concerned about the presence of the novel coronavirus in the United States and abroad and its potential effect on students, families, employees, and community members. I write today to share the latest information we have and some decisions we have made to look out for the wellbeing of our University community and the greater Charlottesville region.</p>\n<p>There has not been a case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, on Grounds or in the greater Charlottesville community, but the Virginia Department of Health has confirmed two cases of COVID-19 in the Commonwealth, both in Northern Virginia. Our immediate risk remains low. The situation, however, is rapidly evolving, much remains unknown about the threats posed by COVID-19, and we take very seriously the responsibility to make prudent choices for the wellbeing of our community. A cross-university team continues to meet regularly to share information in real-time, consider changes in approach that will best protect our community, and set plans in motion for a wide variety of contingencies. I am in contact with them daily, and Provost Magill and I will continue to regularly update the community, through messages and on our website, about what we know and our plans.</p>\n<p>Consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Department of State, and the Virginia Department of Health, we have decided to enact the following restrictions and guidelines on University-related travel in order to help to mitigate our community’s risk of exposure to the virus:</p>\n<p>International Travel</p>\n<p>University-related travel to countries where the CDC has enacted level 3, or the State Department has enacted levels 3 or 4 is prohibited.CDC travel guidance related to COVID-19 is available here.</p>\n<p>Faculty and staff who have exceptional reasons to travel to those countries may submit a petition to the Provost’s office via an email to COVIDtravel@virginia.edu.</p>\n<p>International travel to restricted areas without an approved petition will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>If you travel or have recently traveled to one of these countries, we expect you to follow CDC guidance about self-isolation: stay home for a period of 14 days upon your return and seek medical attention if you experience fever, coughs, or difficulty breathing.</p>\n<p>Domestic Travel</p>\n<p>At this point, we are not prohibiting university-related domestic travel, but we strongly discourage all University travel (both domestic and international) for non-essential purposes, particularly that by air, to large gatherings, and to areas experiencing high numbers of COVID-19 cases, as documented by the CDC. If you must travel, please take all possible precautions before traveling, including staying up to date on the latest spread of the virus and considering difficulties you may encounter in returning home, especially when traveling internationally.</p>\n<p>These guidelines will be effective immediately and will be in place until at least April 15. Before April 15, we will re-assess and determine whether these policies will continue.</p>\n<p>While these guidelines apply to University-related travel, we ask members of the community to apply similar judgment in considering personal travel commitments, both internationally and domestically.</p>\n<p>Spring Break and Beyond</p>\n<p>Many of our students are currently away on Spring Break, so the pace of events on Grounds has slowed for the week ahead. Unless local conditions change, University sponsored events, programs, tours, and operations will continue as planned during Spring Break. We will continue to monitor this issue carefully, relying on guidance from internal experts at UVA Health, the Virginia Department of Health, and the CDC.</p>\n<p>We will write again by the middle of the week with additional updates regarding University programming during the weeks following Spring Break. At this point in time, we plan for students to return to Grounds and to resume classes, but we will be making some modifications to mitigate against the risk of exposure to and transmission of the virus, which we will explain in more detail by mid-week.</p>\n<p>This is a challenging time for our community, the nation, and the world as we respond to COVID-19 and the uncertainty surrounding it. We will do our best to stay on top of this quickly evolving situation, and to communicate with you regularly and fully as conditions change. I am grateful to all of you for your understanding and flexibility, and for your commitment to the wellbeing of our community. This is a time for our community to come together, and acting together, I remain confident in our ability to navigate this difficult and uncertain period.</p>\n<p>For more information, please consult our website, which we are continually updating.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim Ryan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>March 3: Important Updates Related to Spring Break and Student, Faculty and Staff Travel</p>\n<p>The following message to the University community was delivered March 3.</p>\n<p>Dear members of the UVA community:</p>\n<p>Since our last University-wide communication on February 28, the number of national coronavirus (COVID-19) cases continues to rise. While we are not aware of any cases in Virginia, the safety of the UVA and Charlottesville communities is our primary concern. I write to share with you the proactive steps we are taking. Note that this guidance is subject to change as the situation is rapidly evolving. You can find updates and resources on the University’s website.</p>\n<p>Spring Break Study Abroad</p>\n<p>The University has canceled all outbound study abroad programs scheduled over spring break. We notified affected faculty program directors and students today. Schools will work directly with students to arrange for completion of coursework through alternative means.</p>\n<p>Our decision on spring break trips was guided by the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) March 1st recommendation that Universities should reconsider study abroad travel. It is in everyone’s best interest that students avoid unnecessary travel through crowded transportation hubs for short visits to uncertain environments before they return to Grounds. We feel this is the best decision to protect our students and our local community where students will return after their travel.</p>\n<p>We are in close, regular communication with those students who are currently abroad on exchange and other programs, regarding how to monitor and assess their current situations based on conditions in the country they are visiting.</p>\n<p>Travel Guidance</p>\n<p>The CDC maintains a Travel Information website related to COVID-19, and specifically recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to countries at Warning Level 3. Note that these ratings can change rapidly.</p>\n<p>We urge faculty, staff, and students who have personal or professional plans to travel either internationally or to affected areas in the U.S. to reconsider their travel. In doing so, we ask each of you to take into account the possibility of travel delays, future quarantines, or prolonged self-isolation when returning from travel to the UVA and Charlottesville communities.</p>\n<p>If you have travel insurance, you should closely review your plan to assure it does not exclude pandemics in the case of need for medical evacuation.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage faculty and staff to share any travel plans with your department chair, dean, or manager in order to facilitate University assistance if the need arises.</p>\n<p>We strongly urge student organizations (CIOs) to share any travel plans with the Office of the Dean of Students.</p>\n<p>The decisions we are making rely heavily on the guidance we are receiving from the CDC and the Virginia Department of Health and are intended to protect the health and welfare of our faculty, staff, students, and local community. We recognize the uncertainty this global health issue is creating and are committed to keep you informed and up to date as this situation evolves. You may find updates and current information on the University’s website and FAQ.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Liz Magill, Provost</p>\n<p>University of Virginia</p>\n<p>Feb. 28: Message of Solidarity from Provost Magill</p>\n<p>The following message to Chinese faculty, students, staff and scholars was delivered Feb. 28.</p>\n<p>Dear colleagues:</p>\n<p>Today I’m writing to you – our esteemed faculty, staff, and scholars from China – to express the University’s concern and support for you as the coronavirus continues to spread in China and beyond. We understand how worried you must be about your family and friends who are contending with the virus and its effects. As an expression of our support, we made this video, and we have shared it widely with members of our UVA family who are in China.</p>\n<p>UVA officials are carefully monitoring the spread of the virus and listening closely to advice and directives coming from the CDC, the Virginia Department of Health, and the federal government. We are offering online resources via the coronavirus website and through the coronavirus FAQs, which we are updating frequently. If you have questions or concerns that are not addressed in these materials, please call our faculty and staff coronavirus phone line at 434-297-4027.</p>\n<p>We have heard that some of you feel an obligation to offer support to students from China who are here at UVA. We are grateful for your willingness to comfort an</p>","id":"3c000215-7371-53aa-a502-3571aef0301c","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/us/us-virginia/2020-04-10-13_59_43/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Latest Updates on UVA’s Response to the Coronavirus"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"275152b8-2152-52a9-8e99-9dcea9336f30","countryCode":"us","hasApiCode":true,"apiCode":"unitedstates"}}}
