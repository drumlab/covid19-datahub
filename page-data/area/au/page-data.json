We know you, our students, have been heavily impacted by the response we have had to make to the COVID-19 pandemic. I am grateful for your support and understanding. Please know that our staff have been working incredibly hard to shift to a remote operational university; and to resolve many of the questions you've been asking.</p>\n<p>This email will cover:</p>\n<p>Emergency grants</p>\n<p>This semester has been tough, and many of you are experiencing increased financial pressure. To help, we're providing an additional $1million of emergency grant funding. This is in addition to the emergency grants already available through ANUSA and PARSA. These grants can cover accommodation and travel expenses, grocery vouchers, textbooks or IT equipment and medical costs.</p>\n<p>More information is here.</p>\n<p>Residential Hall update</p>\n<p>Our public health experts agree that social distancing is essential to preventing the spread of COVID-19, and our assessment is we are not currently in a state which is acceptable to continue without putting the health of members of our community at risk. So, from now, we need to create more space in our residences, and ensure students minimise their interactions.</p>\n<p>We need all students in residences to complete this form which will help us understand your circumstances. The form is available here.</p>\n<p>Our message today is simple: If you live in one of our ANU residences and can safely move to off-campus accommodation, such as your family home, you should do so immediately. We can help you with your travel if you need it.</p>\n<p>To support you to leave, you'll be able to cancel your accommodation contract and be refunded any rent paid in advance. You won't be required to continue paying rent if you cancel your contract. Students with a room in a residence now will have priority access to their room on campus when they return. More information is available here.</p>\n<p>Those of you who cannot leave, due to travel restrictions, for example, can stay in your room. The residential halls and colleges will remain open for any resident who needs to live on campus. However we will be strictly enforcing hygiene and social distancing protocols without exception. Any student in breach of these measures will be removed from their residential accommodation and subject to University disciplinary proceedings. Details of these tougher protocols will be available today.</p>\n<p>I urge all of you: take these measures seriously. The safety of our community is everyone's responsibility.</p>\n<p>Change to census date</p>\n<p>The census date will be changed from Tuesday 31 March to Friday 8 May 2020. This will give you time to get used to remote learning, knowing you can withdraw from your course(s) without academic or financial penalty.</p>\n<p>Arrangements previously put in place for students impacted by travel restrictions into Australia from China are retained for those students.</p>\n<p>Adjustment of exams, assessment and grading</p>\n<p>We know your studies have been disrupted, and we thank you for working with us to adapt to these changes. One of the changes we're considering may affect the way we grade courses this semester, and how these grades will be shown on your academic transcript. We are consulting widely before making any decision. More details will be available soon.</p>\n<p>The shift to remote learning does mean that all invigilated mid-semester and end of semester exams will be changed to online exams or other forms of assessment.</p>\n<p>We're working with your course convenor(s) to adapt all assessments so they can be completed remotely and they'll be in touch with you to provide an update on assessment and other arrangements for the remainder of the semester. You can read more here.</p>\n<p>Further information for honours and higher degree by research students will also be available soon as we detail the transition to remote research.</p>\n<p>You can find more information about academic adjustments, academic support services, student wellbeing and residential hall information on our website here.</p>\n<p>This year hasn't gone the way any of us planned, but we'll continue to work hard to ensure we minimise disruptions to your studies as best as we can. Please bear with us as we all adjust. Rest assured, we are working around the clock to deliver a great ANU experience, wherever you are this semester.</p>\n<p>Brian</p>","id":"ec9b7ba9-266e-5d06-b96f-223f0bbfad46","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/au/au-anu/2020-04-08-23_41_12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 update to students on changes to ANU campus"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.anu.edu.au/files/story/Student_info_0_1_0.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I am currently overseas; how should I respond to the situation?</p>\n<p>A travel ban is in place for all Australian citizens and permanent residents effective 25 March 2020. The do not travel advice from the Australian Government applies to ANU international students on exchange too. If you are currently overseas, you must return to Australia as soon as possible by commercial means. If you are having difficulties arranging this, please inform us for support and tracking purposes.</p>\n<p>The Global Programs team have directly contacted all exchange students and Student Central have contacted all students with other travel approvals in place with this advice. Communications will always be sent to your ANU email account.</p>\n<p>Please make sure that you are regularly checking your ANU Email account. Please refer to the Smartraveller website for accurate and up-to-date information. Please also ensure you follow any instructions your host university provides.</p>\n<p>Travel circumstances in each country are changing rapidly, in particular border controls. You will need to urgently arrange travel to return home by commercial means. Please note that ANU will make all efforts to assist you with reasonable non-insured expenses related to returning home (this might include things such as a change fee for an existing booking, emergency accommodation, or the cost of a one-way economy airfare). Please keep copies of all booking and payments for any reimbursement claims.</p>\n<p>Who do I contact in an emergency?</p>\n<p>We know this is a difficult time so please ask for help if you need it. In the case of an emergency, please use the emergency contact information for your host country.</p>\n<p>If you require urgent Australian consular assistance, please contact:</p>\n<p>+61 2 6261 3305 from overseas</p>\n<p>1300 555 135 from within Australia</p>\n<p>+61 421 269 080 from SMS</p>\n<p>If you feel unsafe or unsure at any point, you have access to 24/7 emergency support through the ANU Travel Insurance Policy and should carry a copy of the assistance card with you at all times:</p>\n<p>The 24/7 number for ANU (ANU Security) is: +61 612 52249</p>\n<p>You can contact Chubb Security 24/7 for advice and support:</p>\n<p>The 24/7 insurance contact number is +61 2 8907 5995.</p>\n<p>ANU Policy Number: 01PP528643</p>\n<p>You can access the ANU Crisis Support line which is a 24/7 support service available to ANU students experiencing situational stress, emotional difficulties and mental health concerns. The best way for you to access this while on your program is to text them (they should be able to call you if needed) SMS Text message service: +61 488 884 170</p>\n<p>You can also contact the Global Programs team between 9am and 5pm AEST and we can assist you or direct your enquiries.</p>\n<p>I am a concerned family member or friend and my child/loved one is overseas - where can I get more information?</p>\n<p>The University is unable to disclose any specific information without the written consent of students as per the ANU Privacy Policy. We have been in touch with all students directly and are responding to students who have sent through enquiries to us as quickly as we can.</p>\n<p>In the first instance, you should be contacting your loved one to touch base with them directly. Please encourage them to remain actively informed of their circumstances and the quickly changing situation. This includes following advice from the host country health authorities, the host institution, Australian consular services and the ANU.</p>\n<p>How does COVID-19 affect my travel insurance?</p>\n<p>The ANU Insurer (CHUBB) confirmed that COVID-19 was a foreseen circumstance effective 4:00pm on 2 March 2020. This means that new paid travel arrangements made after this date may not be eligible for expenses incurred that relate to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Claims will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. You will need to understand that you may not have insurance coverage for any expenditure relating to COVID-19. You will need to understand that beyond assistance for students who decide to return immediately, the University may not provide financial support for non-insured expenses relating to COVID-19 if you decide to stay.</p>\n<p>ANU will provide additional financial support to affected students to ensure you can safely return home as soon as possible. Students can apply for reimbursement of reasonable travel expenses (e.g. change fee for an existing booking, or one-way economy flight) by contacting ANU Global Programs.</p>\n<p>My host university is offering online courses, can I continue these after leaving my host country?</p>\n<p>ANU can approve you to complete the remainder of your courses online, however credit for these courses remains at the discretion of your academic college. ANU will support you with additional assessment requirements you may have for these courses, e.g. invigilation of any distance examinations.</p>\n<p>I cannot/do not want to continue with online courses. Can I return to ANU and take courses this semester?</p>\n<p>Students may be able to enrol in some courses at ANU up to the ANU census date (Friday 8 May 2020). Please contact the relevant academic college/s as soon as possible if you would like to explore this option. Enrolment at this stage in semester is at the discretion of the academic college, and is dependent on availability of courses.</p>\n<p>Will there be accommodation available to me at ANU when I return?</p>\n<p>If you need to organise accommodation back at ANU to support your return to studies this semester, the ANU Accommodation team can help. Please contact them directly at uni.accom@anu.edu.au or +61 2 6125 1100.</p>\n<p>I will need to self-isolate upon return to Australia, Can ANU provide me with support?</p>\n<p>If you decide to return to Australia, you will now be required to self-isolate for 14 days. This applies to all travellers, including Australian citizens. For details see the Australian Border Force website.</p>\n<p>Please follow all advice from the Australian government and ACT health regarding hygiene and self-isolation.</p>\n<p>The ANU Community Wellbeing team can provide support to you through the self-isolation process, assist with navigating the University to get the referral or help you need with a particular issue, and arrange welfare checks over the course of the self-isolation period. You can contact the team by email at CommunityWellbeing@anu.edu.au, by calling +61 2 6125 3346 (option 1) during business hours, or calling ANU Security (+612 6125 2249) outside of business hours.</p>\n<p>You should also reach out to them if you develop symptoms, require testing for COVID-19 or test positive for COVID-19 - they will be your primary point of contact within the University. Ensuring your wellbeing and protecting your privacy is their upmost priority.</p>\n<p>Can I defer my exchange place to next semester?</p>\n<p>We are not able to support deferments at this stage, however we encourage you to reapply for exchange in Semester 1, 2021 or Semester 2 2021. We will be preferencing students who have been affected by COVID-19 when allocating exchange places for both semesters.</p>\n<p>I have received an OS-HELP loan for my Learning Abroad experience. If I cancel my program, do I need to repay this?</p>\n<p>Once you have received an OS-HELP payment it cannot be rescinded. You can, however, make a voluntary repayment towards your HELP loan through your MyGov account. If you complete this prior to the end of the financial year, the debt amount will not have been indexed. This loan will still count towards your two-loan maximum. If you have not yet received your OS-HELP loan, you can contact global.programs@anu.edu.au to request the loan be cancelled.</p>\n<p>I have received an NCP or Endeavour grant for my learning abroad experience. If my program is cancelled, do I need to repay this?</p>\n<p>If your program has already begun, or you have already made payments which cannot be reimbursed through travel insurance, you will not be required to repay the NCP or Endeavour funding in full. If you have unspent money remaining from your NCP or Endeavour grant, you will be required to repay this to the university. Global Programs will be in contact with you regarding your repayment options. If you have spent the entirety of your grant on travel-related expenses, please let us know.</p>\n<p>I have received a VCTG grant for my learning experience. If my program is cancelled, do I need to replay this?</p>\n<p>Where students have been paid the VCTG funding amount and commenced their programs and an early return is requested, they will not be required to repay the monies. Where students have commenced preparations and spent some of the funding, they will not be required to repay the funding. If the students have not yet expended the monies, they will be requested to repay the funding.</p>\n<p>I have received a scholarship or grant from my College for my learning abroad experience. If my program is cancelled, do I need to replay this?</p>\n<p>College grants and scholarships each have a respective condition of award. Please contact your college or ANU scholarship provider to determine whether the grant or scholarship will need to be repaid.</p>\n<p>I am meant to be undertaking a learning abroad program this coming winter/next semester as part of my ANU studies; will this still be going ahead?</p>\n<p>The University is closely monitoring the situation in relation to COVID-19 and the safety of our community is our highest priority. As a result, the University has made the decision to suspend travel approval for programs scheduled beyond Semester 1 2020 to all destinations. All Winter Session programs have been cancelled. This is not a cancellation of Semester 2 at this stage.</p>\n<p>This is a complex and evolving situation, so we are actively monitoring and implementing required measures as and when appropriate. GP will update students as new information becomes available. If this situation changes Global Programs will be in contact with all nominated students to provide advice on required next steps and your options. For now, please do the following:</p>\n<p>NOTIFY US: Please notify us that you would like to withdraw from your program early.</p>\n<p>DO NOT MAKE BOOKINGS: We strongly recommend you do not make any bookings or outlay any expenditure related to your overseas program as these expenses are unlikely to be covered by insurance if your planned travel is unable to go ahead.</p>\n<p>STAY UP TO DATE: You will need to keep up-to-date with information from the ANU in relation to your program and continue to regularly monitor your ANU email.</p>\n<p>SEEK INFORMATION: We strongly encourage you to inform yourself of the current situation, and the risks associated with travelling.</p>\n<p>I would like to know about future options for international programs for students affected by this recall.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we are not able to support students to defer your exchange placement, if you were not able to take up exchange for 2020 S1. You can re-apply for exchange in 2021. You must start a new exchange application and obtain a new RAID form signed by your ANU academic college(s). Apply as a new applicant through the Global Program System.</p>\n<p>Global Programs will be prioritising any affected Semester 1 or Semester 2 2020 exchange applicant in the Semester 1 2021 round of exchange. You will still need to meet the eligibility requirements and list 5 preferences.</p>\n<p>Where can I find more information relating to the University's response to COVID-19?</p>\n<p>We encourage you to keep up to date with the University's ongoing response to COVID-19 at: <a href=\"https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/covid-19-advice\">https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/covid-19-advice</a></p>\n<p>I have questions/concerns regarding my learning abroad program.

What is the process?</p>\n<p>We understand that a number of home universities or countries are asking you to return home. We also understand this must be a very stressful time for you being so far away from home. You will need to meet with your Head of Residence who will ask you to complete an early departure form. You will need to provide your Head of Residence correspondence from your home university that speaks to your requirement to end your exchange and return home.</p>\n<p>The early departure form and all supporting documentation will be forwarded to ANU's Accommodation Services for review. A request for early termination will not be accepted automatically and Accommodation Services will process the application when possible.</p>","id":"935e669f-de28-531e-bcd3-865239388c25","fields":{"pathname":"/article/institute/au/au-anu/2020-04-08-23_41_16/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Students affected by exchange cancellation"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://www.anu.edu.au/files/story/Working_from_home_0.jpg\"></p>\n<p>We have moved to remote working, teaching, research and studying across ANU.</p>\n<p>This arrangement will be in place for the remainder of Semester One - from Thursday 26 March until Saturday 27 June.</p>\n<p>University buildings will be locked down from Monday 30 March, and staff will not be able to access their building.

As you would be aware, during the week the Australian Government upgraded its travel ban to Level 4 prohibiting all international travel for Australians and banning all foreign nationals from entering Australia due to the coronavirus pandemic.  </p>\n<p>The Government has also strengthened its health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including introducing further restrictions to indoor gatherings. Unfortunately, these measures will make it incredibly difficult to continue with many of our face-to-face teaching activities and some aspects of campus life.</p>\n<p>This Semester is going to be different for all of us - but we are doing everything we can to make sure you keep progressing with your study and make the most of this challenging situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching activities</strong></p>\n<p>We have made the difficult and complex decision to move all teaching activities online for Semester 1 from Monday 23 March 2020. Please be assured, we want to give you as much certainty as currently possible so that you can continue your studies even if that means adjustment to teaching arrangements and term dates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>What will go online:</strong></em>  All learning experiences - lectures, seminars, tutorials, labs and practicals - will be available online where possible. Some essential knowledge and skills cannot be learnt online, and your programs will be adjusted to ensure you gain these prior to graduation. Student support services will also be available online. Please regularly check your course Blackboard sites and your UQ email for changes.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Your timetable:</strong></em>  Your courses will run as previously scheduled unless advised by your Course Coordinator.</li>\n<li><em><strong>What this means for assessment</strong></em> : Course Coordinators are reviewing assessment. For courses that are delivered fully online, there will be no requirement to attend campus for assessment in Semester 1. Please check your course Blackboard site for details. Your Electronic Course Profile (ECP) will be revised and your Course Coordinator will let you know when this is available.</li>\n<li><em><strong>What this means for the academic calendar</strong></em> : With the pause in teaching this week, additional time for teaching and learning activities has been scheduled at the end of the semester.  This will result in a change to examinations and postponing graduation ceremonies.

We previously guaranteed your exams and assessments for all units will be delivered online or remotely. This disruption to assessment methods will impact on individual students differently, and we have therefore put guidelines in place to ensure fair and equitable assessment.</p>\n<p>The following process will apply to our undergraduate coursework units that are not part of professionally accredited courses:</p>\n<p>Students will complete their assessments and exams online or remotely</p>\n<p>Students will receive their final grade</p>\n<p>Students who have passed the unit can then choose to accept their grade OR accept an ungraded pass</p>\n<p>An Ungraded Pass will mean that students can opt out of having their marks for the semester (or for individual units) contribute towards their weighted average mark (WAM).</p>\n<p>I believe this recognises the extraordinary circumstances we find ourselves in and enables you to have some certainty about the outcome.</p>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<p>Units that form part of professionally accredited courses will need to ensure their assessments align with accreditation (or revised accreditation) requirements</p>\n<p>Honours and postgraduate units (and select undergraduate units) may have differing assessment guidelines</p>\n<p>Assessment methods will differ by unit but may include online exams, oral exams (viva voce), continuous assessment or an ungraded pass</p>\n<p>Semester One exams will commence on Saturday 6 June</p>\n<p>Online exam software</p>\n<p>The University is in the processes of procuring Examplify, an assessment program developed and licensed by ExamSoft.

The software includes features to ensure academic integrity.</p>\n<p>More information for academic staff and students on technical requirements, as well as an FAQ page, will be available soon.</p>\n<p>University Medical Centre remains open</p>\n<p>The Medical Centre on campus remains open, providing their regular services through face-to-face visits or Telehealth consultations. Telehealth consultations reduce the risk of exposure to both patients and Medical Centre staff and doctors.</p>\n<p>The Government recently announced an extension to Telehealth appointments which can be bulk-billed through Medicare until 30 September 2020.

We greatly appreciate you taking the time to do so, and we are now working through some of the finer details of your questions and suggestions. This information will be with you shortly.</p>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<p>FAQs about online exams</p>\n<p>Access to UWA buildings from Monday 6 April</p>\n<p>Flu vaccinations: additional information</p>\n<p>Changes to Transperth services from Monday 6 April</p>\n<p>FAQs about online exams</p>\n<p>We understand that many of you have questions about how Examplify, our new online exam software, will work.</p>\n<p>We have published an FAQ guide that includes information on technical requirements (e.g. operating systems and webcams), and we will be adding to this guide as more information becomes available over the coming days.</p>\n<p>Access to UWA buildings from Monday 6 April</p>\n<p>Although the majority of students are now studying online, the Crawley campus will remain accessible for students even though buildings will be locked from Monday 6 April 2020, for reasons of security and staff and student safety. This means you will need your campus card to gain access to areas and to be able to identify yourself if you seek assistance from Security.</p>\n<p>Reid Library, Beasley Library and J Robin Warren Library will remain open as per previous communications. Where you require other facilities for study, these will be provisioned locally through your School and you should seek clarification as to what local access arrangements are being made.</p>\n<p>HDR and research students who need to access facilities can do so but need to agree arrangements with their supervisor.</p>\n<p>If you intend to access buildings on the campus, personal safety is paramount. If you are working alone, we strongly advise that you inform Security of your presence by calling 6488 3020 or emailing security@uwa.edu.au.</p>\n<p>If for any reason you have concerns about your personal safety on campus, please contact Security who will be happy to assist.</p>\n<p>Flu vaccinations: additional information</p>\n<p>Yesterday, we let you know that the UWA Medical Centre is now offering flu vaccinations.</p>\n<p>In response to a couple of queries, we want to clarify that while the flu vaccine doesn’t protect against COVID-19 infection, it is still recommended this year for at-risk groups and health care workers, and to prevent an increased load on the health care system from people falling ill with seasonal influenza. Vaccine administration is taking place in a well-distanced outdoor setting, outside the UWA Medical Centre.</p>\n<p>More information is available from the Medical Centre webpage.</p>\n<p>Changes to Transperth services from Monday 6 April</p>\n<p>Transperth has announced a reduction to public transport services.</p>\n<p>From Monday 6 April, services will revert to Saturday timetables for all routes. As a result, route 950 will offer a reduced number of services daily, whilst routes 96 and 97 will not operate.</p>\n<p>Transperth offers other routes that can be used to access UWA campuses. You can find details of other services and the planned changes on the Transperth website.</p>\n<p>Car parking is currently available for free at all UWA car park locations, regardless of whether or not you have a parking permit.</p>\n<p>We are living in turbulent times. It feels like we are being inundated with sad news from around the world hourly, if not even more often.</p>\n<p>And so to remind you that there is a brighter tomorrow and to keep you working towards that day, some of you may remember this quote from Dr Suess:</p>\n<p>“The more that you read, the more things you will know.</p>\n<p>The more you can learn, the more places you’ll go.\"</p>\n<p>You are strong and resilient students, you must be, you made it to into UWA.
