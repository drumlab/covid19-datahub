of our guests and crews is our top priority. It is our goal to be open and transparent throughout this rapidly evolving situation. This page will be updated regularly with information on COVID-19 impacted flights in our network. Guests in affected rows of the below flights are considered close contacts and may be at risk for exposure. Public health officials recommend that affected individuals self-isolate for 14 days after arrival and monitor symptoms. Guests are advised to contact their primary care provider, or their local public health unit if they are concerned that they may have been exposed to or are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. All guests who were on the listed flights, but not in the affected rows are advised to self-monitor for signs of cough, fever or respiratory issues and to call their local health authorities if symptoms arise within the next 14 days. </p>\n<p>Show 102550100119 entries</p>\n<p>Search:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Flight Date</th>\n<th>Flight

However, due to theunfolding public health emergency, the Wellness Hub’s GPs are being pulled into the public healthcare system. The Hub can no longer maintain its capacity to offer physical health appointments, even remotely, but is committed to offering as much virtual support as possible.</p>\n<p>However, many of the Hub’s counsellors are now able to offer follow-up appointments virtually, and nurses can offer support by telephone. You can access a wide range of support at a distance, from emotional support groups and COVID-19 information sessions to the McGill Art Hive and workshops for managing stress and anxiety; a listing of online support programming is available on their website.</p>\n<p>There are also off-campus services available to students. Maple is one way of accessing an appointment with a GP, at a distance. The University has worked with Blue Cross and Maple to eliminate up-front charges for international students covered by Blue Cross. This service is available to Canadian students, but it may not be covered by all provincial insurance plans or supplemental insurance. While many healthcare services off campus will be reimbursed by your insurance plan, most will require payment up front. Canadian students covered by StudentCare insurance can get reduced rates by visiting providers that are part of the StudentCare network.</p>\n<p>Students also have access to free, remote mental health and well-being support via your keep.meSAFE Student Support Program, with real-time chat and telephonic consult available 24/7 via the My SSP app. Video and tele-counselling options are also available by appointment, call 1.844.451.9700 (or 001.416.380.6578 if outside Canada or the USA- call charges apply). Please note that given this time of heightened concern, call and chat volume may be high and wait times may be longer than usual. After downloading the free My SSP app from your device’s App store, ensure your profile is up to date and that you have allowed push notifications as a way of staying in touch with relevant support.</p>\n<p>We are continuing to update the McGill coronavirus page with new information and FAQs.

These options are intended to provide some relief and additional options to students who passed their course(s) but are unhappy with their grade(s), or those who did not pass.</p>\n<p>The deadline to submit requests for a change of grade to P or NC is Friday May 15, 2020.

With a few exceptions, this has involved closing our buildings to the public. Entry to each building is limited to those individuals with pre-existing card and/or key access. Given that many of you are already working and studying from home, the impact on you should be minimal, but we want you to know that taking this important next step will help us as we follow the advice of health officials to assist with physical distancing.

Examples include the University Health Centre, our district energy system; and many functions addressing health, life, and safety on campuses.

The University of Alberta is working hard to minimize negative impacts to your academic life and future. Your health, safety, and mental well-being is of paramount importance.</p>\n<p>As a result, the university is making a number of changes to our normal practices in order to set students up for continued academic success and with your best interests in mind.</p>\n<p>We have heard from many of you about your concerns related to these changes and we have developed a series of FAQs to clearly answer some of the most pressing concerns you have. These will be included in our website at the link below.</p>\n<p>The changes detailed here are meant to ensure equity among students, preserve academic integrity in these challenging circumstances, and to manage the issues presented by an uncertain future including the impact on our students and human resources. We do this not only with our current semester in mind, but also with a desire to preserve our traditional academic structure as much as possible for Spring and Summer 2020.</p>\n<p>We know this is a different approach than we typically follow. All post-secondary institutions across the world will be faced with the same challenges. While we anticipate many different approaches will be developed, we also know that other institutions will be aware of, and consider, the exceptional circumstances for the Winter 2020 term in evaluating transcripts.</p>\n<p>We recognize that the changes will have an impact on you as a student. There are still many uncertainties to be resolved, including how the sector will align these approaches, however we are confident we are making the best possible decisions for the University of Alberta and our students. While we can’t control all of the external factors, we will be engaging with our partner institutions, key stakeholders and funding agencies to communicate these decisions and to identify solutions that minimize potential negative impacts on scholarships, funding applications and admissions to other institutions.</p>\n<p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>\n<p>These changes have also been communicated to instructors.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: The following information applies to both undergraduate and graduate courses</p>\n<p>REVISED GRADING REGULATIONS The decision to go to the revised grading regulations was motivated by our desire to ensure equity among all our students, preserve academic integrity in these challenging circumstances and manage the issues presented by an uncertain future including the impact on our students and human resources. All students will receive a credit (CR) or no credit (NC) grade for all Winter 2020 courses. No letter grades will be assigned.</p>\n<p>The only exceptions to this will be made by Deans of programs where grades are required for accreditation or licensure requirements. Students will be contacted directly, no later than March 27, 2020, if this exemption applies to them.</p>\n<p>The university will make a note on transcripts to indicate this grading scheme reflects the university’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We understand that having a sense of relative performance within a course may be very necessary for some students applying to highly competitive programs. We are working to develop a template letter for instructors where they can easily indicate how a student performed relative to their peers within a course.</p>\n<p>While this won't replace traditional grading, it will be a useful addition to applications. FINAL EXAMS AND ASSESSMENTS There will be no in-person final exams or assessments for Winter 2020 courses.</p>\n<p>There will be no proctored remote exams for any Winter 2020 courses unless approved by the Dean of the Faculty offering the course. These will be exceptional circumstances. Students will be contacted directly if this exemption applies to them and their final exams will be delivered by remote proctored delivery.</p>\n<p>All final exams and assessments will be delivered remotely and will be held according to the schedule previously published by the Registrar.</p>\n<p>Students will be informed by the instructor of the format of their final exam or assessment and receive a modified course outline that communicates this information to you clearly no later than March 27, 2020 to allow you to make an informed decision before the withdrawal deadline.</p>\n<p>If students require alterations in their approved accommodations, please contact arrec@ualberta.ca . REVISED SYLLABUS (COURSE OUTLINES) All Winter 2020 course outlines will be updated by March 27, 2020 to outline all changes to assessments and grading so that students are informed of exactly how assessments and grading will be dealt with for each of their courses.</p>\n<p>The modified syllabus will clearly communicate the revised expectations for grades, assessments, and exams. ACADEMIC STANDING REGULATIONS MAY BE MODIFIED The following information applies to both undergraduate and graduate students Academic standing is used to determine the eligibility of students to continue or graduate from their programs.</p>\n<p>Academic Standing Regulations may be modified by the Dean of each Faculty to minimize any negative impact on students as a result of the changes to grading, exams, and final assessments for the Winter 2020 term.</p>\n<p>Students affected by this will be notified by their faculty Dean no later than April 1, 2020. WITHDRAWAL DEADLINE CHANGE The withdrawal deadline has been extended to April 8, 2020. If you withdraw at this point, your transcript will reflect a “W”</p>\n<p>This deadline gives students an additional week to review the revised course outline, consider their individual circumstances with respect to the changes to course delivery, grades, assessments, and exams, and make an informed decision about whether to complete or withdraw from Winter 2020</p>\n<p>The last day to withdraw from courses without being assessed for full fees was, in most cases, February 5, 2020.

The University of Alberta has also made adjustments to admissions-related deadlines and document requirements. The admissions practice changes are designed to provide students with a sense of reassurance that these disruptions, which are outside of their control, will not negatively impact their application and enrolment at the U of A.</p>\n<p>While these changes address many of the concerns and challenges we are hearing, we’d also like to reassure applicants, their families, and school counsellors that reasonable accommodations will be made for applicants whose learning environments have been disrupted.</p>\n<p>These admissions practice changes aim to ensure that the academic changes and disruptions in global education systems that have accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic do not disadvantage applicants to University of Alberta programs, and ensure all applicants are treated in a fair and equitable manner.</p>\n<p>Calculation of Admission GPA - University of Alberta Students</p>\n<p>For current post-secondary students applying to an undergraduate or graduate program, grades issued by the University of Alberta for courses taken in Winter 2020 will not be included in the calculation of admission GPAs.</p>\n<p>A University of Alberta grade of CR from Winter 2020 will contribute to the credit requirements for admission and will be accepted as satisfying program prerequisites.

Your university is with you under these circumstances, which have no precedent in our society’s recent history. </p>\n<p>We have several important pieces of information to share with you, including the resumption of distance learning activities. Please read these directives carefully. Much of what follows is also of interest to teachers and administrative and support staff. </p>\n<p><strong>Resumption of teaching activities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All <em>in-person</em> teaching activities remain suspended until further notice. </li>\n<li>Starting Saturday, March 21, teaching activities that can be conducted in <em>distance-learning</em> mode – and only those teaching activities – can resume. “Distance learning” refers not only to online classes but to all forms of instruction other than in-person teaching. </li>\n<li>The first session after the resumption of instruction must not be devoted, in whole or in part, to an exam, test or submission of an assignment.</li>\n<li>IMPORTANT: To find out which courses are resuming on March 21, students should check their UdeM email inbox (@umontreal.ca) or Studium. The faculties will inform students through these channels of how classes will resume in distance-learning mode. </li>\n<li>STUDIUM: Students will find in Studium information on technological and other tools that could be useful to them in their courses, and on the support that will be available to help them complete their semester remotely.</li>\n<li>ATTENTION: Course content posted online by teachers, recorded or not, is subject to the same intellectual property rights as content provided in class. Reproducing and disseminating it in any way whatsoever without express authorization is strictly prohibited and could lead to disciplinary action.</li>\n<li>In this time of severe stress, some students may require psychological support. Students can call the Aspiria 24/7 psychological helpline made available by <a href=\"http://www.aseq.ca/\">ASEQ</a>, the student health insurance plan, at any time. While it is closed for the moment, the UdeM health and psychological consultation centre (CSCP) is following, by e-mail and phone, the people it has already treated. The CSCP team is also working to make online psychological sessions available to students who need help. We will let you know as soon as the service is available. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Relaxation of rules concerning studies and admissions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Changes to dates and weighting of evaluations</strong>. Due to the special circumstances, teachers may, if necessary, make adjustments to the dates and/or weighting of evaluations for the Winter 2020 semester without consulting students. </li>\n<li><strong>Course withdrawals</strong>. The deadline for dropping courses that had not been completed by March 13 is extended by two weeks. </li>\n<li><strong>Absence at a test</strong>. As of Thursday, March 26, students who need to be absent at an evaluation will have to report it by filling out a new form available on the Centre étudiant. From the time this form is available until the end of the Winter 2020 semester, students will not be required to submit a document attesting to the reason for their absence. The form will be automatically forwarded to the program head for approval. </li>\n<li><strong>Students with disabilities</strong>. Many students with disabilities require accommodations for test-taking. We encourage teachers to be flexible with evaluation procedures for these students. The Disability Support Service can assist you if needed. </li>\n<li><strong>Teacher evaluations</strong>. Student evaluation of teaching is cancelled for the Winter semester.</li>\n<li><strong>Possible extension of the semester</strong>. The end of the Winter 2020 semester is still set at April 30. Our goal remains to complete as many courses as possible by April 30. However, we are aware that some educational activities, such as placements and lab work, cannot be done remotely and they may therefore be extended. We are giving ourselves until May 22 to complete all courses, and if necessary some could even be extended beyond that date. </li>\n<li><strong>Registration for Fall 2020</strong>. Registration for the Fall 2020 semester on the Centre étudiant will open on April 16 instead of April 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Thesis defence and comprehensive exam</strong>. As previously announced, thesis defences will be conducted remotely until further notice. For this purpose, participants are encouraged to use the <a href=\"https://wiki.umontreal.ca/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=143524413#Listedesservicesparcat%C3%A9gories-multimedia\">technological tools</a> available to the academic community. The University will be flexible in applying the rules if a thesis defence has to be postponed. The same instructions apply to the oral section of the comprehensive exam. </li>\n<li><strong>Research design and ethics committee</strong>. Assessment of research design and research protocols is subject to the same rules as courses. Activities resume next week. Please contact the secretary (TGDE) for your program to confirm the date. As well, the ethics committees will continue meeting remotely. Submissions must be made as scheduled. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>General Information</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The University remains open and staff are on the job. However, in accordance with government directives, much of the work continues to be done remotely (telework). </li>\n<li>Open or closed? For health reasons, many university services for students and the public are closed. To find out which university services are open and which are closed, see the <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/faq/#liste-des-services\">list</a>. </li>\n<li>Starting tomorrow, Friday, March 20, access to the buildings will be restricted. Only the main entrances will be open. </li>\n<li>The libraries are closed and will remain closed until further notice. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please bear in mind that, in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus, it is very important to keep gatherings to a minimum and to follow the social-distancing guidelines recommended by public health authorities. </p>\n<p>We encourage you to visit the <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/faq/\">Urgence UdeM</a> website regularly.

The management committee is assessing the situation on a daily basis, with the support of the units and our experts in epidemiology, and it is regularly updating our measures to safeguard our community’s health and safety. </p>\n<p>In light of the latest developments and the recommendations made earlier today by Québec Premier François Legault, the University has decided to take the following five actions: </p>\n<h2><strong>Cancellation of teaching and research activities abroad for students.</strong></h2>\n<p>All teaching and research activities organized by the University abroad are cancelled until the beginning of the fall semester, whether or not they are in an area currently considered to be a high-risk zone. The University is in regular contact with students who are abroad for study and is assessing their return on a case-by-case basis. </p>\n<h2><strong>Travel restrictions</strong>.</h2>\n<p>As of March 12 and until the start of the fall semester, the University is cancelling all travel by administrative and support staff outside Québec for professional reasons. In addition, the University strongly advises teaching staff not to travel to the rest of Canada or abroad. We also recommend that members of the university community avoid all travel outside the country for personal reasons. Members of the community should be aware that if they do not follow these guidelines, they may not be covered by UdeM’s medical and cancellation insurance plans. </p>\n<h2><strong>Self-isolation after travel.</strong></h2>\n<p>As Premier Legault announced, we are asking all staff and students who have returned from a trip outside Canada since March 12 to self-isolate for 14 days as a precaution, regardless of what country they visited. Employees returning from travel abroad should notify their manager as soon as possible. Students who need to self-isolate are asked to fill out the voluntary declaration form (GEN<em>COVID</em>19) available at the <a href=\"https://identification.umontreal.ca/cas/login.ashx?service=https%3a%2f%2facademique-dmz.synchro.umontreal.ca%2fpsp%2facprpr9%2f%3fcmd%3dlogin%26languageCd%3dCFR%26userid%3dCAS%26pwd%3dz&#x26;methode=POST&#x26;cmd=login\">Centre étudiant</a> under the “Formulaires” tab. </p>\n<h2><strong>Suspension or postponement of classes with 250 students or more.</strong></h2>\n<p>In accordance with the government's recommendation, the University is suspending all classes and other in-person teaching activities involving more than 250 students. Affected teaching staff and students will receive instructions shortly. Among other things, the various measures circulated to all teaching staff earlier this week may be implemented. </p>\n<h2><strong>Cancellation or postponement of major special events.</strong></h2>\n<p>All special events involving large gatherings will be cancelled or postponed. This measure is effective as of March 13 and covers all activities other than teaching or research conducted to meet the requirements for a degree or for the purposes of a research project. The cancelled activities include, but are not limited to, graduation ceremonies, conferences, cultural activities, sports events, student celebrations, the “Les Belles Soirées” lecture series, galas, ceremonial events, etc. The purpose is to limit gatherings as much as possible, since they are vectors of virus transmission. Outside organizations planning an activity at one of our campuses will be informed that the University will advise members of the UdeM community not to attend. </p>\n<p>These measures will remain in effect until the situation returns to normal. The University is leaving it to the discretion of the units to decide whether working meetings involving a significant number of people (e.g., faculty councils) should be held as planned, postponed or conducted remotely using technological means.  </p>\n<p>The University administration continues to monitor the situation closely. Other measures may be announced in the coming days.

The University administration is acutely aware of the problems and has put in place accommodations to help you complete the Winter semester.</p>\n<p>We are writing today to give you more details about these measures and to answer questions you have asked about some of them, such as missing an evaluation, dropping courses, and pass/fail grading.</p>\n<p>Please read the following carefully. This message outlines the options available to you for the Winter semester and could affect the course of your studies in subsequent terms.</p>\n<h2>Absence from an evaluation: details</h2>\n<p>If you were unable or anticipate being unable to take an evaluation, you should fill out the <strong>CHE<em>Absence</em>évaluation</strong> form, available on the Centre étudiant, as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>You will not have to produce any document, such as a doctor’s note, to justify your absence. If none of the reasons listed on the form applies to your situation, you can explain the reasons for your absence in the space provided. If your reason is accepted, you will be entitled to the same accommodation. You will receive an answer, positive or negative, as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>If you miss an evaluation for a valid reason, you will have to make it up in some way: a deferred exam, a written assignment, etc. Your teacher will determine the appropriate course of action, in consultation with the program director.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the type of make-up evaluation that is required, a REM (deferral) will be entered on your transcript for the course until the evaluation is completed. A deferred exam must be taken by the end of the following semester, unless an additional delay is approved by the Dean of your faculty because of exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p>NOTE: You can register for a course even if you have a REM on your transcript for a prerequisite.</p>\n<h2>Extended deadline: details</h2>\n<p>If you are unable to submit an assignment by the due date, you must notify your program's secretary (TGDE) as soon as possible. You must also complete the <strong>CHE<em>Absence</em>évaluation</strong> form available on the Centre étudiant, indicating the reason why you are unable to submit your work. Your faculty will contact you shortly.</p>\n<p>The same rules apply to graduate students except for the following special cases: submission of a proposal, submission of a project for evaluation by the ethics committee, submission of a project to the doctoral committee, comprehensive exam, thesis defence. In these cases, if you are absent or late, you must contact your research supervisor and your program director to agree on specific accommodations.</p>\n<h2>Inability to complete a course</h2>\n<p>Some of you may be unable to finish a course and complete the evaluations during the Winter 2020 semester. This would be the case, for example, for students who are currently working long hours in the health and social services system. </p>\n<p>If you are in this situation, contact your program director as soon as possible. They will advise you on the best option (deferred evaluation, pass/fail grading, withdrawal from the course) depending on your circumstances. </p>\n<h2>Choice of pass/fail grading</h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/evenement/article/147006/\">previously announced</a>, the University is allowing students to choose pass/fail grading for the majority of courses during the Winter semester. A pass/fail grade has no numerical value and therefore does not count towards your average.</p>\n<p>More information about this option:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may request pass/fail grading for the course(s) of your choice, with the exception of excluded courses.</li>\n<li>Faculties may decide to exclude certain courses from pass/fail grading for various reasons. If your request is for one of these courses, it will not be accepted. You will receive a letter grade for the course.</li>\n<li>For courses where the final evaluation requires special conditions that cannot be met due to the health crisis, faculties are authorized to change the grading scale to pass/fail for all students enrolled in the course. The official transcript will reflect that decision.</li>\n<li>Pass/fail grading means the final grade for the course will be a pass or a fail, based on all evaluations in that course.</li>\n<li>Students who want to opt for pass/fail grading may do so as soon as the grades are posted on the Centre étudiant by filling out the <strong>CHE<em>choix</em>barèmeH20</strong> form, which will be available on the Centre étudiant at the <strong>end of April</strong>.

To withdraw from a course, you must complete the <strong>INS<em>Annul</em>Abandon_cours</strong> form available on the Centre étudiant.</p>\n<p>If you drop a course, you will be able to take it again the next time it is offered. In some cases, you will be able to replace it with another course, with the approval of the program director.</p>\n<p> In some programs, course withdrawals are uncommon since they can have a significant impact on the student’s progression and delay graduation. For these programs, withdrawals must be authorized by the appropriate authority.</p>\n<h2>Summer term</h2>\n<p>We remind you that the beginning of the Summer 2020 semester, originally scheduled for May 4, has been postponed to May 18. As in the Winter semester, the courses will be given online or by means that do not require you to be on campus.</p>\n<p>Registration for some summer courses is now open. Over the next few days, new courses will be added to the summer calendar and these will also be open for registration.</p>\n<h2>Financial aid</h2>\n<p>The University is working on providing financial aid for students who need additional financial support to complete the Winter semester on account of the health crisis. An announcement will be made next week.</p>\n<h2>Educational supports</h2>\n<p>The University is doing everything it can to support you under the exceptional circumstances in which we all find ourselves.

Our students, in particular, have shown tremendous resolve in completing their courses under extremely stressful circumstances.</p>\n<p>From the beginning of this crisis, we had hoped that one particular decision would not be necessary. Convocation is that special time of year when our academic community comes together to celebrate the accomplishments of our graduating students. We all cherish this great U of T tradition, when we witness first-hand the excitement of our graduating students – and the pride of their families – as they cross the stage in Convocation Hall.</p>\n<p>We have consistently relied on the guidance from public health authorities as we have navigated our way through the pandemic. Unfortunately, the latest guidance indicates that the need for physical distancing to limit or slow the spread of the virus will continue for some time. It is for this reason that we have taken the difficult decision to cancel all Convocation ceremonies for the Spring 2020 season, previously scheduled to take place from June 2-19.</p>\n<p>Students who complete their degree requirements will still graduate and receive their degrees and parchments. We are currently exploring possible alternative means of celebrating your graduation, and we will be back in touch with you as soon as possible with more information. In the meantime, I invite you to consult our <a href=\"/covid19-datahub/message-from-the-university-regarding-the-coronavirus?utm_source=UofTHome&#x26;utm_medium=WebsiteBanner&#x26;utm_content=MessageRegardingTheCoronavirusForTheUoFTCommunity\">COVID-19 website</a> for the latest updates.</p>\n<p>We appreciate that this decision will come as a huge disappointment to our graduating students, their families, friends, teachers and mentors. While many other universities have come to a similar decision, this does little to diminish our shared disappointment. We take enormous pride in your accomplishments, and we want to give you the send-off you deserve.</p>\n<p>You have learned and achieved so much during your years at U of T. And your presence has strengthened our academic community through your countless contributions inside and outside the classroom. Receiving your degree is one of the most important milestones in your life. We are so sorry that we cannot celebrate this achievement in the traditional way.</p>\n<p>Convocation is an occasion to look back with pride and to look forward with hope. Even though we cannot gather in person, we remain tremendously proud of the Class of 2T0. And from what I have seen and heard of your leadership in this most difficult time, we have all the more reason to hope – both for your own success in the years to come, and for the future of our society.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Meric S.

We have been exploring different ways to recognize this important milestone, and I am pleased to share more details with you today.  </p>\n<p>Over the past few weeks, the Office of Convocation, in collaboration with the Offices of the President and the Chancellor, has led an extensive review of possible alternative celebrations that would respect the guidance from public health authorities, while acknowledging the achievements of our graduating class in an appropriate and fitting manner.   </p>\n<p>Accordingly, we are planning a celebration that pairs a virtual Convocation with in-person, graduation ceremonies hosted by our academic divisions. </p>\n<p>The Chancellor, who is the Chair of Convocation, will convene a virtual Convocation to be broadcast on or before June 2, 2020, incorporating the core elements of a Convocation ceremony. Following the legal requirements under the  <em>University of Toronto Act</em> , the Chancellor will confer degrees on all graduates. In these exceptional circumstances, all degrees will be conferred  <em>in absentia</em>. Diploma parchments will then be couriered to graduates over the course of the next few weeks following the virtual ceremony.</p>\n<p>When the public health situation stabilizes and it is possible to gather safely, individual academic divisions will then be able to host in-person graduation ceremonies, complete with many of the core elements of a traditional Convocation, including academic regalia, congratulatory remarks from academic leaders, a graduation speaker, and presentation of the graduates. </p>\n<p>Of course, the uncertainties surrounding the present crisis make it impossible to provide firm dates for these in-person graduation ceremonies at this time. It is likely they will take place sometime after September 1, 2020 – as safety, availability, and space permit.

Having the chance to meet and celebrate with Waterloo’s newest alumni and their loved ones is something I personally hold close in my heart. I will greatly miss being able to share in your celebrations and honour your accomplishments.</p>\n<p>You will receive your diploma</p>\n<p>Your convocation is the culmination of years of hard work, passion, and commitment. You have had the unwavering support of your friends, family, and community – including everyone here at the University. We want you to know we will confer degrees in June so you can start on the next steps of your career journey.</p>\n<p>We will make sure that you get your diploma most likely in the mail. Please also watch your email inbox in June for your “virtual” convocation.</p>\n<p>We will send these documents to the home address that we have available for you in Quest. Please ensure that we have the correct address for you in Quest by June 1, 2020.</p>\n<p>We are working to give you the best experience possible as you graduate from Waterloo this spring.</p>\n<p>You can choose to attend a ceremony in person at another time</p>\n<p>We know that your family and friends who have supported you may wish to celebrate this milestone with you. We will give you and your classmates the opportunity to attend an in-person convocation ceremony at another time. While we know that this may not be an option for some students, we want to make sure that you have this choice to come back to campus and celebrate your accomplishments.</p>\n<p>Although we hope to be able to welcome you to Waterloo in the fall, we do not know exactly when this will be during this period of great uncertainty. We will share more information with you by July 1, 2020. Please know that we look forward to you joining us to celebrate your graduation and that we will do all that we can to provide you with more information as soon as it is available.</p>\n<p>The past two weeks have shown how resilient and understanding our community is in the face of unprecedented times that are impacting each of us. Thank you for making the University of Waterloo a stronger, more vibrant university with you as a student and soon to be alumnus.
