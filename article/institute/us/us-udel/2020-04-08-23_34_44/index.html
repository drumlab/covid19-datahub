<p>March 26, 2020</p>
<p>Dear UD Graduate Education Community,</p>
<p>As UD prepares to resume its spring semester, we find our community in the midst of a public health threat unlike anything we have experienced. The University remains committed to your health and safety, so we are reaching out to our graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to share important information regarding academic policies and ways to protect your health and wellbeing during this time.</p>
<p>The information below gives you an overview of what to expect and where you can find additional resources. University faculty and research advisers are available to help, as they will also be important sources of information and guidance for you. We are all seeking to maintain continuity in our courses and research, even while University buildings are only open to essential personnel and not accessible for routine activities.</p>
<p>In addition to reading the information below, please check your email regularly for continued updates. Also visit www.udel.edu/coronavirus to find more information on the University’s response initiatives as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic situation. The site is continually updated as new information becomes available.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Doug Doren</p>
<p>Interim Vice Provost for Graduate &#x26; Professional Education and Dean of the Graduate College</p>
<p>Resources for Graduate Students</p>
<p>Academics</p>
<p>Academic Policies</p>
<p>We are actively working on addressing flexibility for graduate study academic policies. Additional information will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Courses</p>
<p>Graduate students enrolled in coursework should follow the guidance being given to all UD students, and expect that classes will be delivered online starting March 30. Your instructors will provide further guidance about specific plans for their courses.</p>
<p>Research</p>
<p>All on-campus research has been restricted to essential activities. Building access will be provided only for the most critical needs (e.g., maintaining animals, critical cell cultures, unique reagents, essential equipment and materials). Graduate student researchers should work with their advisers or PI to plan efforts that will allow them to engage in research remotely. Find additional guidance and protocols—including access to Virtual Town Halls recorded on March 16 and 24—on this webpage.</p>
<p>Teaching</p>
<p>Students employed as teaching assistants should work with faculty in charge of their courses to plan how they will support online teaching. Both the Faculty Commons and the Center for Teaching and Assessment of Learning (CTAL) have excellent resources to support effective distance learning on their course continuity websites. CTAL will partner with Faculty Commons colleagues to offer bi-weekly conversations designed to help instructors and graduate assistants succeed in a digital learning environment. Specific details are forthcoming and will be published on the CTAL website. While specific assignments may change with the shift to online classes, expectations for TA workloads are the same, being limited to 20 hours per week, on average.</p>
<p>Theses and Dissertations</p>
<p>Please plan to have committee meetings and dissertation defenses remotely. You do not need to be on campus to submit a thesis or dissertation. Electronic signatures will be accepted on the signature pages and defense forms. The signed signature pages will be accepted as attachments, and the Graduate College will print to bond paper. There is some flexibility in deadlines for submission in time for Spring 2020 graduation. Please contact Mary Martin for additional details.</p>
<p>Finances</p>
<p>Graduate stipends</p>
<p>The President and Provost have asked that faculty continue to support graduate students in their current roles, even if they are unable to continue their work in person, with compensation at current levels. Due to the range of different work they do, research assistants (RAs), teaching assistants (TAs) and graduate assistants (GAs) may each be affected differently. Individuals should ask their supervisor about how to continue carrying out their work responsibilities. In many cases, their work assignments will change so that they can be productive without coming to campus. For example, TAs may be asked to support online courses, and most graduate student researchers will have to do work that does not require access to a laboratory.</p>
<p>Financial Hardship</p>
<p>Although the University is committed to continuity of pay for graduate students on contract, we recognize that other factors related to COVID-19 may have an impact on finances. Emergency loans (up to $1,000) are available from the Graduate College for students on contract. Please contact Mary Martin to apply. The Student Financial Services Office also has an emergency loan program (up to $500). The contact for these loans is Joseph Bradley.</p>
<p>The University of Delaware’s Student Crisis Fund also supports eligible students who face a serious financial hardship due to an unanticipated crisis. Situations are considered on a case-by-case basis, and the fund may be able to help with such issues as food or home insecurity, out-of-pocket medical costs or other emergencies. Learn more or apply by visiting <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/deanofstudents/support/#crisisfund">https://sites.udel.edu/deanofstudents/support/#crisisfund</a>.</p>
<p>Health and Wellbeing</p>
<p>Discrimination</p>
<p>Discriminatory actions do not align with our community values. To officially report an incident of discrimination, please visit <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/oei/">https://sites.udel.edu/oei/</a> to file a complaint with the Office of Equity and Inclusion. If this is a criminal matter, contact UD Police at 302-831-2222 (non-emergency number).</p>
<p>Domestic Violence</p>
<p>Students can contact the Center for Counseling &#x26; Student Development at 302- 831-2141 or 302-831-1001 for after-hours emergencies, or contact Student Health Service at 302-831-2226 or University Police at 911 or 302-831-2222 (non-emergency number). Faculty and staff may contact the Employee Assistance Program within Human Resources at 302-831-2171.</p>
<p>Groceries and Food Insecurity</p>
<p>Many local grocery stores offer delivery services.</p>

<p>Food Lion <a href="https://www.foodlion.com/promotions/to-go/">https://www.foodlion.com/promotions/to-go/</a></p>
<p>For those who need assistance with food, there are local nonprofits that offer additional resources.</p>
<p>The Food Bank of Delaware <a href="https://www.fbd.org/get-help/">https://www.fbd.org/get-help/</a></p>
<p>Blue Hen Bounty Food Pantry bluehenbounty@gmail.com</p>
<p>Health Insurance</p>
<p>Many graduate students have purchased health insurance from Aetna through UD. Aetna has made special accommodations for students who need testing, treatment or counseling services related to COVID-19. Please visit their site for the most current information.</p>
<p>Mental Health and Wellbeing</p>
<p>Everyone should make an effort to maintain social ties and reduce the impact of isolation. Students who feel overwhelmed during this period may contact the Center for Counseling &#x26; Student Development at 302-831-2141 or 302- 831-1001 for after-hours emergencies.</p>
<p>Note: Due to the rapidly evolving situation, the Center for Counseling &#x26; Student Development (CCSD) will not conduct face-to-face meetings. Please call CCSD 302-831-2141 (or the UD Helpline 24 hours a day, 302-831-1001) if you are in need of emergency assistance or consultation. For updates, please visit their website at <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/counseling/">https://sites.udel.edu/counseling/</a>. An additional resource available to all is the National Suicide Hotline at 800-273-8355.</p>
<p>Technology</p>
<p>UD IT offers information for working from home, learning from home and teaching from home. These resources provide step-by-step instructions and tips for connecting remotely.</p>
<p>Here are free Internet Essentials resources for remote learning.</p>
<p>Charter Spectrum Broadband is also offering free service.</p>
<p>Also, please know that many broadband and wifi providers are offering free and/or reduced access to students who are impacted by the coronavirus situation. See this article from Forbes for additional information.</p>
<p>For graduate students who need access to laptops, please email grad@udel.edu.</p>
<p>Travel</p>
<p>All University-sponsored or affiliated travel, including domestic travel, is temporarily suspended until further notice. The University is also discouraging personal travel to reduce risks for exposure in other locations that may present higher risk. Please review the Travel FAQ for the latest information on other restrictions. Members of our community are reminded to register all travel plans with the University’s Office of Risk Management on this form. Graduate students who received funding through a Graduate College Travel Award for meetings that have been canceled, or who need to change plans, should contact Carol Steinbrecher. It is our intention that students not have to bear the cost of any changes.</p></div></div></div></div><div style="text-align:center"><span role="img" aria-label="github" class="anticon anticon-github"><svg viewBox="64 64 896 896" focusable="false" class="" data-icon="github" width="1em" height="1em" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M511.6 76.3C264.3 76.2 64 276.4 64 523.5 64 718.9 189.3 885 363.8 946c23.5 5.9 19.9-10.8 19.9-22.2v-77.5c-135.7 15.9-141.2-73.9-150.3-88.9C215 726 171.5 718 184.5 703c30.9-15.9 62.4 4 98.9 57.9 26.4 39.1 77.9 32.5 104 26 5.7-23.5 17.9-44.5 34.7-60.8-140.6-25.2-199.2-111-199.2-213 0-49.5 16.3-95 48.3-131.7-20.4-60.5 1.9-112.3 4.9-120 58.1-5.2 118.5 41.6 123.2 45.3 33-8.9 70.7-13.6 112.9-13.6 42.4 0 80.2 4.9 113.5 13.9 11.3-8.6 67.3-48.8 121.3-43.9 2.9 7.7 24.7 58.3 5.5 118 32.4 36.8 48.9 82.7 48.9 132.3 0 102.2-59 188.1-200 212.9a127.5 127.5 0 0138.1 91v112.5c.8 9 0 17.9 15 17.9 177.1-59.7 304.6-227 304.6-424.1 0-247.2-200.4-447.3-447.5-447.3z"></path></svg></span> Built by Applysquare and contributors with ❤️<a href="/covid19-datahub/about">About us</a></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/article/institute/us/us-udel/2020-04-08-23_34_44/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-81a7d07cf4ee2741ccb9.js"],"component---src-templates-index-page-js":["/component---src-templates-index-page-js-bfa7f6d2bfcba7a639fe.js"],"component---src-templates-area-page-js":["/component---src-templates-area-page-js-2f953d52b1de5d42bd82.js"],"component---src-templates-area-institute-list-page-js":["/component---src-templates-area-institute-list-page-js-99994abb4e6a0419d5f2.js"],"component---src-templates-institute-page-js":["/component---src-templates-institute-page-js-01360ee66037544176f6.js"],"component---src-templates-about-page-js":["/component---src-templates-about-page-js-e752419eab8f27903689.js"],"component---src-templates-data-floorplan-page-js":["/component---src-templates-data-floorplan-page-js-92f2ab6a62f98b9fe1d3.js"],"component---src-templates-article-page-js":["/component---src-templates-article-page-js-773740c4abc5f47f7c0b.js"],"component---src-templates-update-page-js":["/component---src-templates-update-page-js-5fad6f152238ed1f1314.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-46f24afeccb4be848208.js"],"component---src-pages-all-area-index-js":["/component---src-pages-all-area-index-js-bbafb2ee2eaddaffc575.js"],"component---src-pages-article-index-js":["/component---src-pages-article-index-js-350de780ff29fe973a1d.js"],"component---src-pages-institute-index-js":["/component---src-pages-institute-index-js-40d85da227d4da507db4.js"],"component---src-pages-resource-index-js":["/component---src-pages-resource-index-js-b8b296f10816c45555a4.js"],"component---src-pages-update-index-js":["/component---src-pages-update-index-js-5ddc877d8460f106163a.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/covid19-datahub/component---src-templates-article-page-js-773740c4abc5f47f7c0b.js" async=""></script><script src="/covid19-datahub/commons-642b90fbb00cd715bffd.js" async=""></script><script src="/covid19-datahub/styles-17c4a4044bbae2b97e50.js" async=""></script><script src="/covid19-datahub/app-81a7d07cf4ee2741ccb9.js" async=""></script><script src="/covid19-datahub/netlify-identity-widget-220917daeac5e7121287.js" async=""></script><script src="/covid19-datahub/webpack-runtime-9d08989b0a4ee2c06028.js" async=""></script></body></html>
