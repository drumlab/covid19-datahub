<p>Suspect in custody; message from President Harvey Stenger</p>
<p>5:33 p.m.</p>
<p>Dear Binghamton University Community,</p>
<p>I am deeply saddened to write to you regarding last night's stabbing that led to the death of one of our students, Joao Souza, a 19-year-old freshman engineering student. The entire campus mourns for him. Our sympathies go out to his friends and family, as well as to his classmates and peers. A suspect is in custody. I thank our Binghamton University Police, New York State Police and the Broome County District Attorney's office for their quick work in apprehending the individual as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As president, my top priority is keeping everyone in our campus community safe. I want to reaffirm to you Binghamton University's commitment to providing a safe learning environment. Unfortunately, we live in a time where violence is part of society, and, as a campus of 17,000+ students and several thousand faculty and staff, there are occasions where violence will intrude on our campus. We will continue to focus on keeping ours a safe campus, with a fully-empowered state law enforcement agency that works closely with the residential communities to protect life and property.</p>
<p>Part of fostering a safe campus involves quick, clear communication with the community. Over the past 18 hours we've sent a number of messages alerting parents, students and faculty and staff. However, to get the alerts, faculty and staff need to sign up for the service by going to <a href="https://www.getrave.com/login/binghamton">https://www.getrave.com/login/binghamton</a> and logging in or going to BU BRAIN in <a href="http://my.binghamton.edu">http://my.binghamton.edu</a> to update B-Alert contact information. Subscribers can add up to three email addresses and three cell phone numbers by clicking on "My Information" and updating their information under Emergency Alert Notification (Rave Mobile Safety).</p>
<p>This has been a very difficult semester for me and the entire campus with two student deaths in just a few weeks. These tragedies shake us to the core and we grieve together.</p>
<p>President Harvey G. Stenger</p>
<p>President</p>

<p>University statement</p>
<p>The University has understandably received questions with respect to what actions people on campus should be taking while a suspect remains at large. As previously stated, law enforcement believes the attack was not a random act and that the victim was targeted. University Police have the support of other law enforcement agencies that are currently on campus assisting with the investigation and with other law enforcement responsibilities. If there is any specific action that law enforcement believes people on campus should take in the interest of their safety, the University will communicate that information via the campus alert system and on the binghamton.edu/alert page. We anticipate a return to our normal schedule of classes tomorrow, April 17.</p>
<p>We have always offered safety advice to students living on and off campus. In reminder of those precautions – our residence halls are always locked and only residents of that building have key card access. Do not allow someone unknown to you to follow or tailgate you in. If that happens, report it to hall staff on duty or police.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<p>• Keep your Binghamton ID with you at all times. If your ID is lost, it should be immediately reported to University Police.</p>
<p>• Keep doors to your room and/or suite locked and do not share room combination/key information.</p>
<p>• Register for the Binghamton Alert System at <a href="https://www.getrave.com/login/binghamton">https://www.getrave.com/login/binghamton</a> or at BU BRAIN to receive emails and/or text messages about critical campus information and emergencies. You can add up to three email addresses and three cell phone numbers to your account and I encourage you to add your parents as well.</p>
<p>• Report any suspicious activity to University Police at 607-777-2393 or <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/police/">https://www.binghamton.edu/police/</a></p>
<p>1:53 p.m.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to subscribe their parents to their B-Alert account by going to <a href="https://www.getrave.com/login/binghamton">https://www.getrave.com/login/binghamton</a> and logging in or going to BU BRAIN at <a href="http://my.binghamton.edu">http://my.binghamton.edu</a> to update B-Alert contact information.
