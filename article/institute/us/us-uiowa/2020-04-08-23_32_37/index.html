<p>The following updates were sent to the University of Iowa campus community on March 30, 2020:</p>
<p>COVID-19 Campus Update for Faculty and Staff</p>
<p>Dear faculty and staff:</p>
<p>Please see these important COVID-19-related updates as they pertain to tuition and fees, virtual instruction tips and resources, and recreational facilities and programming.</p>
<p>Tuition/Fee Update</p>
<p>Tuition is necessary to cover the University of Iowa’s ongoing operations, including retaining the faculty and staff needed to provide virtual instruction and online student support services. The university’s faculty will continue to deliver excellent instruction virtually, which allows students to receive course credit and stay on their educational path toward degree completion and graduation. For this reason, the university will not be refunding students’ tuition for the Spring 2020 semester.</p>
<p>The university understands this is not what students or their instructors signed up for at the start of the semester. The decision to move to virtual instruction was not made easily, but it was determined that proactive steps were necessary to maintain the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff. The UI is not alone in this decision, as hundreds of universities nationwide have made the same choice in light of the global pandemic. The UI is recognized as a national leader in online instruction and already is one of the largest providers of online education, ranking in the top 50 nationally. Teaching and learning experts from across campus collaborated with faculty to transition courses to a virtual environment. So, while the format for delivering instruction may have changed temporarily, the UI remains committed to continuing to provide a world-class educational experience for its students during this difficult time.</p>
<p>The university will refund, on a prorated basis, several fees including:</p>
<p>Room and Board : Refund prorated March 19 to May 16</p>
<p>: Refund prorated March 19 to May 16 Recreation Fee : Refund prorated from March 23 to May 16</p>
<p>: Refund prorated from March 23 to May 16 Arts &#x26; Cultural Events Fee : Refund prorated from March 23 to May 16</p>
<p>: Refund prorated from March 23 to May 16 Course Fees: Colleges are currently reviewing course specific fees. Refunds will be determined on a course-by-course basis.</p>
<p>University Billing fees</p>
<p>The UI will not charge late payment fees for U-Bills for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester. Typically, students who pay less than the minimum amount due on their U-Bill are assessed a late payment fee. This fee will be waived for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester.</p>
<p>Registration restrictions, or registration holds, for past due balances will not be assessed for Summer 2020 or Fall 2020 registrations. This applies to any past due balances on U-Bills commencing on Jan. 1, 2020, or later. If a student had a past due balance of $100 or more before Jan. 1, 2020, that registration hold will remain in place until the past due balance is paid or arrangements are made with the University Billing Office.</p>
<p>Please contact the University Billing Office at ubill@uiowa.edu or by phone at 319-335-0071 with questions.</p>

<p>Object-based learning</p>
<p>The University of Iowa Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) is transitioning to provide support in new ways for instructors as they develop online courses for this and future semesters. If teaching goals and objectives can be creatively supported by virtual access to collections, exhibits, or desired lectures and programming, instructors are invited to reach out via email. Offerings could include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>virtual tours</p>
<p>high-resolution photos of collections objects and/or exhibits</p>
<p>live or pre-recorded video feed of objects or spaces</p>
<p>live-feed presentations from library or museum professionals on collections objects, exhibits, or requested topics of expertise</p>

<p>Recreational Services</p>
<p>Because the UI will continue virtual instruction through the rest of the Spring 2020 semester, Recreational Services will extend the closure of its facilities and cancellation of programming through at least the end of the Spring 2020 semester.</p>
<p>The closure will include the following facilities:</p>
<p>The Campus Recreation and Wellness Center (CRWC)</p>
<p>The Field House (FH)</p>
<p>The Hawkeye Tennis &#x26; Recreation Complex (HTRC) which includes the Outdoor Rental Center (ORC)</p>
<p>Fitness East in Halsey Hall (FE)</p>
<p>Administrative and academic offices will remain open virtually according to regular schedules</p>
<p>More specific information on how this will impact membership charges is available here.</p>

<p>University Housing and Dining</p>
<p>Due to the closure of most residence halls and dining facilities on March 19, 2020:</p>
<p>Each student’s remaining room and meal plan charges will be credited to their U-Bill no later than May 1, 2020.</p>
<p>The credit will be equal to 48.739 percent of room and gold, black, or hawkeye meal plan semester charges. This was calculated based on 119 contract nights in the spring semester, of which 58 remained when the residence halls and dining facilities closed.</p>
<p>Students who purchased meal plans but live off campus will be issued a credit of 48.739 percent. If off-campus students would like to continue to use their meal plan in the open locations for the rest of the spring semester, they must respond to University Housing and Dining at housing@uiowa.edu by April 6.</p>
<p>Students with Herky Booster Packs will not receive a refund, but use of the Herky Booster Packs will be extended through May 2021. Students with Herky Booster Packs who will not be returning to campus can apply for a prorated refund here by May 31.</p>
<p>All Hawkeye Dollars in students’ accounts will remain and can continue to be used until they graduate or leave the University of Iowa.</p>
<p>Students who have been granted approval to remain in the residence halls will maintain their spring 2020 housing and dining contracts and will be sent a separate e-mail regarding their remaining spring housing and dining bill.</p>
<p>Refunds</p>
<p>Credits will be posted to each student’s U-Bill for the fees and housing refunds that occur. Please review U-bill statements after credits are posted and if a credit balance remains on the U-Bill, students can elect to have the credit refunded or have a credit balance remain for future semesters. Students will be able to make that election in MyUI no later than May 1, 2020.</p>
