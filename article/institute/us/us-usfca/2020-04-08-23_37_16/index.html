<p>First and foremost, thank you. Thank you for the patience and grace you all have shown as we come together as a community, albeit remotely, and move forward together.</p>
<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>First and foremost, thank you. Thank you for the patience and grace you all have shown as we come together as a community, albeit remotely, and move forward together. I know this is not the semester you were planning nor hoping for and I want to assure you that faculty and staff are working tirelessly to ensure that you continue to have an engaging and transformative USF experience. While we may not be together in the traditional sense, the USF mission and values that we all embrace — to be in service with and for one another and our communities — are more important than ever and will continue to connect and inspire us during this challenging time.</p>
<p>Below you’ll find details about how you can continue to access comprehensive student services, which are central to the personalized, distinctive education that USF provides. As of today there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in our community, but in keeping with public health orders we are changing operations and implementing social distancing in how we deliver student services to control the spread of the virus. All of the information below will also be posted on the myUSF resource page, and we will continue to update you with additional information about the host of support and resources available to ensure your success.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Julie Orio</p>

<p>Student Employment</p>
<p>As we prepare to modify campus operations and execute plans for remote operations and support reduced residential operations, USF’s goal is to provide our student employees with remote work opportunities that will continue to engage them and provide the financial assistance they depend on.</p>
<p>Student employees and their supervisors should work together to create remote working plans where possible. Supervisors will also identify additional areas or tasks that may present opportunities for another student employee who may not be eligible for a remote working arrangement due to the nature of their job. Supervisors may contact Student Employment for support. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring appropriate remote working plans are in place, including agreed upon tasks, substantiation of their student employees work, and virtual check-ins throughout the semester. Additional details, further instructions, and resources will be communicated to student employee supervisors and budget managers soon.</p>
