<p> <strong>Enrolment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All currently enrolled graduate research students will continue to be enrolled.

<li>Students and supervisory teams should maintain regular contact and develop or review the research project plan to identify the best way to maintain progress, with particular attention to the next six months.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Research project progress</strong></p>
<p>Students should contact their supervisors and put a management plan in place to manage their enrolment over the next six months given the COVID-19 situation. The plan should consider the following matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where research data collection activities are unavoidably delayed, you may consider leave options as outlined in the<a href="https://www.monash.edu/graduate-research/faqs-and-resources"> Doctoral and Research Masters handbooks</a>. Refer to Chapter four: Changes to enrolment</li>
<li>Students with planned fieldwork should consult their supervisor, review and update their risk assessment to ensure that all current Government requirements can be appropriately accommodated.</li>
<li>Research ethics queries in relation to fieldwork protocols should be referred to your supervisor and the Associate Dean (Research) in your Faculty.</li>
<li>In the event that your project and fieldwork activities cannot be undertaken or rescoped, you may consider a <a href="https://gradresearchforms.apps.monash.edu/leave">leave of absence</a>.</li>
<li>Queries regarding access to on-campus facilities and resources related to your research project should be directed to your supervisor and enrolling Faculty.</li>
<li>Where finalisation of your research and/or thesis submission is delayed, you may consider leave options as outlined in the<a href="https://www.monash.edu/graduate-research/faqs-and-resources"> Doctoral and Research Masters handbooks</a> (Chapter four: Changes to enrolment)or extension provisions (refer to section eight of the <a href="https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/797157/Graduate-Research-Progress-Management-Procedures.pdf">Graduate Research Progress Management Procedures)</a></li>
<li>Where appropriate to do so, students may consider working on their research project from home in consultation with their supervisor, provided that there is a clear and productive work plan and regular contact is maintained, including regular contact with the supervisory team.</li>
<li>Where research cannot reasonably progress and other activities such as Monash Doctoral Program professional development are complete, then students may consider a period of leave.</li>
<li>Where a currently enrolled student is required to undertake a period of self-isolation, they may undertake their research activities remotely or apply for a period of leave as outlined in the<a href="https://www.monash.edu/graduate-research/faqs-and-resources"> Doctoral and Research Masters handbooks</a> ****</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Progress management</strong></p>

<li>Students and supervisors should continue to meet, subject to compliance with the <strong>general health information</strong> above.</li>
<li>PhD and Research Masters Milestone Review Panels (MRPs) are expected to continue where the mandatory social distance requirements (1.5m between persons and room capacity allowance of no less than 4m2 per person) can be implemented. However, where necessary, the delivery can be modified (for example: presenting and delivering via Zoom). All milestones should be conducted in compliance with the <strong>general health information</strong> above.</li>
