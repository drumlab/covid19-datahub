<p>All student email</p>
<p>Covid-19 update Tuesday 24 March - health and wellbeing, accommodation, support fund and online teaching</p>
<p>Dear students</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued patience as we work through the details of our response to the Covid-19 crisis. And thank you too for the understanding you have already shown for the changes we are having to make.</p>
<p>Last night, the UK Government gave clear advice about how we can all help to respond to the crisis. This includes: a clear instruction to stay at home except for a number of tightly specified activities, including essential basic shopping for food and medical supplies, adhering to social distancing rules, and banning all social gatherings of more than 2 people.</p>
<p>I appreciate many of you will have questions and concerns, both about these new measures, but also about how we are moving to online teaching and assessment for the summer term. I address some of these issues below, and you should continue to visit our Covid-19 webpages for further information. I also have updates below about our ongoing support for our now dispersed community of students, and rent instalments for the summer term.</p>
<p>Keeping safe</p>
<p>We are proud that York students are such an important part of our compassionate, caring community. I encourage you all to continue to support your family and friends during this difficult time. The latest UK Government advice makes it very clear what we need to do.</p>
<p>The new measures include:</p>
<p>Staying at home except for essential trips to shops for basic food items, health reasons, for essential work, or if you are getting supplies to support an older or vulnerable person;</p>
<p>Staying 2 metres (6ft) away from other people;</p>
<p>Washing your hands as soon as you get home;</p>
<p>Advising any British citizens who remain abroad to return to the UK as quickly as possible as airports around the world begin to close down.</p>
<p>This staying at home message makes it even more important that we find new ways of talking, listening to, and supporting one another. I will be back in touch in the next few days with some further ideas about how we can all stay in touch and give that support, working with both YUSU and GSA.</p>
<p>Accommodation and summer term</p>
<p>Our campus accommodation remains open for our students. The college teams will continue to support our residents during these exceptional times. As I wrote to you last week this is a rapidly changing situation - we have already encouraged those of you who can return to their homes to do so. Many of you have chosen to do this already and after last night’s advice from the Government, more of you may wish to consider this option. In light of that we have listened carefully to your concerns about rental agreements and I can now confirm that if you notify the University you wish to cancel your accommodation contract, there will be no charge made from the start of the summer term - Tuesday 14 April.</p>
<p>We will be contacting those with rental agreements with the University with more detailed guidance, including how to notify accommodation teams, financial processes and check out arrangements. This offer of early contract cancellation also applies to students in Student Castle who booked directly through Accommodation Services.</p>
<p>The Student Hub and College teams are also available to provide emotional and wellbeing support and advice for those students remaining on campus or who have accommodation contracts with private providers.</p>
<p>Emergency Student Support Fund (COVID-19)</p>
<p>Through donations from alumni, friends, and supporters of the York Unlimited philanthropic campaign, I am delighted to announce that we are launching the Emergency Student Support Fund. This will provide financial support of up to £500 (per applicant) for students facing unanticipated financial challenges.</p>
<p>Applications will open to students at 5pm Wednesday 25 March 2020 and will close 5pm Wednesday 1 April 2020 (with further dates to be announced). Details of how to apply will soon be available on <a href="https://coronavirus.york.ac.uk">https://coronavirus.york.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<p>All current students who are fully-registered at the University of York on a degree-awarding (UG/PG/FT and PT) programme are eligible to apply for the Emergency Student Support Fund. Please note that prioritisation will be made on the basis of the student’s individual needs.</p>
<p>I know some of you have also been asking about student loans. The UK Government has assured us that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is planning to make Term 3 tuition fee payments as scheduled and that students will continue to receive maintenance payments on the scheduled dates.</p>
<p>Online teaching and assessment</p>
<p>As you can imagine, preparing to move over 18,000 students to a method of online teaching and assessment that will suit their discipline and stage of progression is a huge undertaking. Our aim is to continue to support you in your studies, and help you to progress to the next phase of your programme.</p>
<p>We have been working closely with departments to agree which online platforms will be most suitable to deliver teaching. This also includes the types of alternative assessments that we will need to use to replace closed exams in exam halls, laboratory work, group assignments, and performances.</p>
<p>We are thinking through the different scenarios, assessing the options and testing the technical details. We will be in a position to tell you more very soon, to give you a clearer picture of how your studies will resume at the start of the summer term. We are aiming to provide additional information for students this week, and further updates on areas where we are still working through the details by the end of next week.</p>
<p>Supporting our Students</p>
<p>The health and wellbeing of our students remains an absolute priority. We appreciate this is a worrying and stressful time. Many of you have written to tell us how the uncertainty caused by Covid-19 is affecting your studies and your health. We are listening and our student-facing teams are in a position to provide online assistance to support you.</p>
<p>Support teams available to students on and off campus include Open Door, Student Hub, Disability, and Colleges, as well as conduct and respect. You will understand that most of these services now need to be delivered remotely for the safety of staff and students, and in line with the latest Government advice.</p>
<p>We know that students with disabilities have particular concerns and we encourage those with a support plan in place who are concerned about assessments to contact the Disability Team.</p>
<p>More broadly, our academic and college staff, and our colleagues behind the scenes keeping our digital systems up and running, and our accommodation open for those who need it, are making every possible effort to support you on campus or remotely. They are doing an extraordinary job, and I thank them for all their work in these difficult circumstances. However, as the situation evolves, in these unprecedented times, we may need to make changes to the services we can offer or we may need you to do things differently. We will let you know if anything changes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please continue to contact the Student Hub if you have particular concerns. Our overnight Security team is also available on campus to provide additional support.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to keep yourselves healthy and safe. It is absolutely vital that you follow the guidance provided by the Government and health services of the country where you reside. In the UK, we ask that you keep referring to the latest Government advice and staying at home guidance. If you are self-isolating on campus and you have any queries or concerns please contact the Student Hub.</p>
<p>I will be in contact again in the coming days with further information, but in the meantime, keep checking your emails and the Covid19 webpages for new guidance and updates.</p>
<p>With warm wishes</p>
<p>Charlie</p>
<p>Professor Charlie Jeffery</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor and President</p></div></div></div></div><div style="text-align:center"><span role="img" aria-label="github" class="anticon anticon-github"><svg viewBox="64 64 896 896" focusable="false" class="" data-icon="github" width="1em" height="1em" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M511.6 76.3C264.3 76.2 64 276.4 64 523.5 64 718.9 189.3 885 363.8 946c23.5 5.9 19.9-10.8 19.9-22.2v-77.5c-135.7 15.9-141.2-73.9-150.3-88.9C215 726 171.5 718 184.5 703c30.9-15.9 62.4 4 98.9 57.9 26.4 39.1 77.9 32.5 104 26 5.7-23.5 17.9-44.5 34.7-60.8-140.6-25.2-199.2-111-199.2-213 0-49.5 16.3-95 48.3-131.7-20.4-60.5 1.9-112.3 4.9-120 58.1-5.2 118.5 41.6 123.2 45.3 33-8.9 70.7-13.6 112.9-13.6 42.4 0 80.2 4.9 113.5 13.9 11.3-8.6 67.3-48.8 121.3-43.9 2.9 7.7 24.7 58.3 5.5 118 32.4 36.8 48.9 82.7 48.9 132.3 0 102.2-59 188.1-200 212.9a127.5 127.5 0 0138.1 91v112.5c.8 9 0 17.9 15 17.9 177.1-59.7 304.6-227 304.6-424.1 0-247.2-200.4-447.3-447.5-447.3z"></path></svg></span> Built by Applysquare and contributors with ❤️<a href="/covid19-datahub/about">About us</a></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/article/institute/uk/uk-york/2020-04-08-23_25_28/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-81a7d07cf4ee2741ccb9.js"],"component---src-templates-index-page-js":["/component---src-templates-index-page-js-bfa7f6d2bfcba7a639fe.js"],"component---src-templates-area-page-js":["/component---src-templates-area-page-js-2f953d52b1de5d42bd82.js"],"component---src-templates-area-institute-list-page-js":["/component---src-templates-area-institute-list-page-js-99994abb4e6a0419d5f2.js"],"component---src-templates-institute-page-js":["/component---src-templates-institute-page-js-01360ee66037544176f6.js"],"component---src-templates-about-page-js":["/component---src-templates-about-page-js-e752419eab8f27903689.js"],"component---src-templates-data-floorplan-page-js":["/component---src-templates-data-floorplan-page-js-92f2ab6a62f98b9fe1d3.js"],"component---src-templates-article-page-js":["/component---src-templates-article-page-js-773740c4abc5f47f7c0b.js"],"component---src-templates-update-page-js":["/component---src-templates-update-page-js-5fad6f152238ed1f1314.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-46f24afeccb4be848208.js"],"component---src-pages-all-area-index-js":["/component---src-pages-all-area-index-js-bbafb2ee2eaddaffc575.js"],"component---src-pages-article-index-js":["/component---src-pages-article-index-js-350de780ff29fe973a1d.js"],"component---src-pages-institute-index-js":["/component---src-pages-institute-index-js-40d85da227d4da507db4.js"],"component---src-pages-resource-index-js":["/component---src-pages-resource-index-js-b8b296f10816c45555a4.js"],"component---src-pages-update-index-js":["/component---src-pages-update-index-js-5ddc877d8460f106163a.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/covid19-datahub/component---src-templates-article-page-js-773740c4abc5f47f7c0b.js" async=""></script><script src="/covid19-datahub/commons-642b90fbb00cd715bffd.js" async=""></script><script src="/covid19-datahub/styles-17c4a4044bbae2b97e50.js" async=""></script><script src="/covid19-datahub/app-81a7d07cf4ee2741ccb9.js" async=""></script><script src="/covid19-datahub/netlify-identity-widget-220917daeac5e7121287.js" async=""></script><script src="/covid19-datahub/webpack-runtime-9d08989b0a4ee2c06028.js" async=""></script></body></html>
