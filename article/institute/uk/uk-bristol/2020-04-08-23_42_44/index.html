<p>Dear student</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience while your lecturers have been designing alternative assessments for the summer period.</p>
<p>We know that many of you will be concerned about the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on your health and that of loved ones, and that you may be dealing with significant practical difficulties. We recognise that some members of our community are likely to have a period of illness in the coming weeks and months. For many of you, the current circumstances will have brought a great sense of disappointment at a time when you would otherwise have been bringing your learning to fruition.</p>
<p>We are writing to explain the ways in which we are seeking to help you maintain a focus on your studies in this challenging and unpredictable environment, without adding unduly to your stress or harming your academic outcome.</p>
<p>We want to reassure you that your final academic outcome will not be disadvantaged by engaging with assessments taking place under these contingency arrangements, ie you will suffer no detriment.</p>
<p>The purpose of the assessments you undertake in the summer is to:</p>
<p>Enable you to engage in your studies and online teaching with a focus in mind</p>
<p>Test your achievement against robust standards without the risk of being penalised by lower grades</p>
<p>Be better prepared for next year’s study or for your next steps (employment, further study etc) if you are graduating</p>
<p>Provide an opportunity for you to improve on your existing grades.</p>
<p>If you are a final year or taught postgraduate student, we are committed to ensuring that you are able to graduate with as little delay as possible, so you can progress to jobs or further study. Where feasible, we advise finalists and PGT students to spend time and energy on your dissertations or project work, as these will develop skills and capacity which will outlast this crisis. If you are a returning student, our arrangements will ensure you are academically well-prepared to continue your course.</p>
<p>How will I be taught in Summer Term?</p>
<p>Summer term will commence on Monday 20 April for undergraduate students and some postgraduate students. All teaching will be online. It is important that you keep engaging to complete your studies this year and to ensure that you are prepared for study next year.</p>
<p>In every course where teaching remains, there will be a programme of work which will combine online materials and assignments to work through in your own time and, in most cases, some regular opportunities for ‘live’ interaction with your teachers and other students. There will be four weeks of teaching on this basis, followed by a revision week, through to the end of May.</p>
<p>How will I be assessed?</p>
<p>We are reducing assessment requirements to the minimum possible during the summer term, and limiting the number of timed exams. For finalists, we will assess only what is still required for us to certify that you have met the requirements of your course, and to award highly-regarded degrees on a robust basis. For returning students, we will assess only what is required for you to show that you are academically prepared to enter the next year of study. In some courses with external accreditation, our assessments will give you the opportunity to demonstrate that you have met these professional standards. Precise details may vary between subjects because of individual disciplinary requirements.</p>
<p>What if I can’t participate in the online teaching?</p>
<p>If you cannot participate in online teaching, we will ask you to let us know once in any 14-day period.</p>
<p>Please let your School Office know if you are struggling with connectivity and technical issues. They will be able to direct you to suitable technical support, or put alternative arrangements in place.</p>
<p>If you are having difficulties related to well-being, please contact your teachers, personal tutors and the Wellbeing Service for support.</p>
<p>What if I can’t undertake my assessments?</p>
<p>For any students unable to undertake summer assessments, there will be a further opportunity during a second assessment period. We will publish the dates as soon as we are able. These assessments will also be online.</p>
<p>For any circumstances which have affected you since 1 March 2020, and until 18 September 2020, you will not need to provide any evidence. Schools and exam boards will automatically allow you an extension or a deferral to a second summer assessment period.</p>
<p>Should I submit extenuating circumstances now?</p>
<p>If you find that there are very exceptional circumstances that we should be aware of, which go beyond the arrangements we are putting in place, please seek advice from your personal tutor, Senior Tutor or the Wellbeing Service. You will be able to use the simplified extenuating circumstances process during the summer term. Please wait for this simplified EC process before submitting anything into the system now, but please let your personal tutor or the well-being service know so that we can support you.</p>
<p>I’m a Postgraduate student, will I be able to do my dissertation or project?</p>
<p>Taught postgraduate students may progress to the dissertation or project phase of the degree, even if the assessments in the taught element are not yet complete – your programme directors will be in touch with further details.</p>
<p>I was supposed to have a re-sit from Teaching Block 1, what’s going to happen?</p>
<p>If you were expecting a re-sit connected to work in Teaching Block 1, please await confirmation from your school – here again, we will look to be flexible.</p>
<p>Will I get my coursework back within the standard 3-week timeframe?</p>
<p>Please be aware that it may not always be possible to mark and return your work within our normal period of three weeks: staff are working extremely hard, but in the current situation our capacity may be reduced because of illness.</p>
<p>Are graduations going ahead?</p>
<p>We have taken the difficult decision to postpone our graduation ceremonies. We are working hard to schedule alternative gatherings when possible, and we thank everyone for their understanding. We will be in touch across the next few weeks with further information.</p>
<p>Successful graduates will receive their degree award following the Examination Boards, which will take place for undergraduate finalists during July and during September (for students who need to defer some assessments).</p>
<p>If you have queries and concerns, please consult our Frequently Asked Questions page in the first instance.</p>
<p>Remember we have resources available if you need support with your study skills. Wellbeing support in these challenging times is also available.</p>
<p>We hope that this information gives you greater clarity and certainty in a time of crisis. We understand how difficult these circumstances are for you, and as a staff we empathise with all the disappointment and disruption you must be experiencing. We hope that you will be able to take a break and rest over the coming Easter period, and that you will return ready to engage in the online community which your lecturers have been preparing. Please be assured that we are doing our best to support you, academically and personally, as we walk through this challenging time together.</p>
<p>Take care and keep well,</p>
<p>Professor Tansy Jessop</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor Education</p>
